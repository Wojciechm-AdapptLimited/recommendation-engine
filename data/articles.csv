Cosmere,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cosmere,"""“you’ve stumbled into something far, far bigger than you, your politics, or your little planet ... your questions are dangerous. once you step behind the curtain and see the actors as the people they are, it becomes harder to pretend the play is real. ”-khriss to kelsier"" the cosmere is a fictional shared universe where many of brandon sanderson's books take place. as a result, books set in the cosmere share a single cosmology and underlying rules of magic, and some characters from one world will make appearances on other worlds. despite the connections, brandon has remained clear that one does not need any knowledge of the broader cosmere to read, understand, or enjoy books that take place in the cosmere. the core sequence of the cosmere will consist of the dragonsteel series, the elantris trilogy, at least four eras of the mistborn series, and the stormlight archive. the story of the cosmere does not include any books that reference earth, as earth is not in the cosmere. for a complete list of books in the cosmere, see the bibliography section below. the shared ""creation myth"" of the cosmere revolves around adonalsium, the power of creation, which was broken into sixteen pieces called shards in an event known as the shattering of adonalsium. the shards are effectively gods, and magic is derived from their power. properties and forces[edit] realms[edit] in the cosmere, everything exists in three realms: the physical realm, the cognitive realm, and the spiritual realm. the three realms have existed since the beginning of the cosmere. when someone in the cosmere dies, their body remains in the physical realm and a cognitive shadow forms in the cognitive realm. for most people, this cognitive shadow quickly moves on to the beyond and their investiture returns to the spiritual realm. the more investiture someone held in life, the longer they can linger before being drawn to the beyond, but only slivers-those who once held a significant portion of a shard's power-can resist the beyond forever, though they can still choose to go if they so desire. before the person passes to the beyond, however, they can still be restored via investiture healing or be infused with enough investiture to become a more permanent cognitive shadow, usually as a result of a shard's action. those killed by nightblood or anti-investiture or consumed by yelig-nar, however, cannot be resurrected in any way, as nothing remains of their soul. time travel to the past, in any of the realms, is impossible. the physical realm[edit] in the physical realm, the cosmere is a star cluster of about 50 to 100 stars. the physical realm is composed of fundamental particles known as axi and follows ordinary laws of physics, except when the other realms are involved. currently, there are ten known planetary systems in the cosmere, which contain a total of twelve notable planets. the cosmere is also home to other celestial objects, including several dwarf planets, gas giants, and constellations. at least one person has tried to leave the physical bounds of the cosmere, with unknown results. the cognitive realm[edit] the cognitive realm is closely modeled on the physical realm, though there are significant differences. because the cognitive realm is the realm of thought, it is substantially impacted by how people imagine and perceive ideas. for example, outer space is significantly compressed in the cognitive realm, because people do not spend much time thinking about the space between planets. there are also some entities that naturally exist primarily in the cognitive realm, such as the spren who personify thoughts, emotions, and natural features, as well as certain cognitive shadows. the appearance of the cognitive realm around a particular planet seems to reflect salient characteristics of that planet-around scadrial, for instance, it is composed of mist, while around roshar it is composed of spheres. land and water are inverted in the cognitive realm-what is solid land in the physical realm is unstable ground in the cognitive, while bodies of water in the physical are solid in the cognitive. as a result, physical beings attempting to traverse non-solid regions of the cognitive realm risk drowning in whatever composes the local cognitive realm, though cognitive entities can traverse these regions safely. the spiritual realm[edit] ""“all things exist in three realms, gaotona. physical, cognitive, spiritual. the physical is what we feel, what is before us. the cognitive is how an object is viewed and how it views itself. the spiritual realm contains an object’s soul-its essence-as well as the ways it is connected to the things and people around it. ”-shai discussing the realms with gaotona"" the spiritual realm exists beyond space and time. as such, it is not truly a place, but rather is the realm of concepts like intent, identity, connection, and fortune. everything exists in the spiritual realm in its ideal form. ""“intent matters. intent is king. you cannot do what i attempt by accident. you must mean it.”-navani kholin on the role of intent"" intent is the spiritual property that expresses a person's considered will or purpose. intent cannot be formed accidentally; if intent is required to do something, then the person attempting to do it must not only do it, but mean to do it. many invested arts require their user to act with intent in order to properly use their magic. invested entities, like spren, cognitive shadows, and even shards have a fundamental intent that describes the purpose of the investiture that constitutes their essence. indeed, the longer they exist, the more they will become bound by their intent, unable to act against it. an extreme example of this is ati, the original vessel of the shard ruin, who was initially a ""kind and generous"" man, but became so consumed by his shard's intent that he sought the complete destruction of scadrial and even viewed it as necessary. along with intent, there is also the associated concept of command. commands are more limited than intent, but they help to focus the intent so that investiture can respond appropriately. while most commands are related to a certain invested art or some other specific method of manipulating investiture, there are also the dawnshards, four fundamental commands that were involved in both the creation of the cosmere and the shattering of adonalsium. identity is the spiritual property that demarcates one person or object from another and describes who or what they are. losing their identity during the false desolation turned the singers into slaveform. identity also serves as the lock and key for metalminds; feruchemists can only withdraw attributes stored by someone with a matching identity-ordinarily, this means only attributes they stored. because identity describes who a person is, it is closely tied to the concept of a spiritweb, which is sometimes called spiritual dna. spiritwebs are not entirely understood, but they are quantifiable in some way, and seem to record information about a person's investiture, such as the genetics that make one an allomancer. magical healing in the cosmere usually works by using investiture to make a person's condition in the physical realm more closely match their idealized self in the spiritual realm, though this idealized self is filtered through the person's perception of themself in the cognitive realm. as a result, healing is usually limited by how a person views themself, and once a person accepts something as part of themself, it will not be able to heal. ""“yours is the power of connection, of joining men and worlds, minds and souls.”-the stormfather to dalinar kholin, explaining the powers of the bondsmiths"" in addition to containing this information about a person or object's identity, the spiritual realm also stores connection between people, objects, and even more abstract concepts. for example, a person can form connection to a region, which will allow them to speak that region's language. in order to take up a shard after a vessel dies, a person must be connected to that shard. because the spiritual realm exists beyond space and time, it-along with the associated property of fortune-can be used to see events in other locations or even the future, though this is generally very difficult. investiture[edit] ""“[i]t seemed you were soulcasting to give your illusions weight. but then, concentrated stormlight has a faint mass to it. ”-jasnah kholin on the relationship between investiture and mass"" just as there is an equivalency between mass and energy, in the cosmere these things can also be exchanged with a magical power known as investiture. when investiture is accounted for, the cosmere adheres to the ordinary laws of conservation and thermodynamics. investiture mostly exists in the spiritual realm, though it is more precisely understood as transcending the realms. however, it can also exist in a ""condensed"" form in the physical realm as solid, liquid, or gas. if left alone, investiture will, over time, become self-aware, resulting in a splinter. khriss suspects that the land itself on sel is undergoing a process like this as a result of devotion and dominion's investiture being trapped in the cognitive realm. more common examples of this process include seons and spren. investiture has a property that associates it with one of the sixteen shards of adonalsium; at the shattering of adonalsium, all investiture was divided evenly between the shards. even though, as a result of the shattering, all investiture is associated with a shard, investiture also remains linked to adonalsium in some way and the shattering meant ""everything and nothing at the same time"" to investiture. when one form of investiture attempts to co-opt or corrupt another form of investiture, it will often produce a red effect. examples of this include the red smoke given off by shai's soulstamps when she uses them to temporarily tweak gaotona's soul, the red haze of trell invading scadrial, and the red coloring of some of the spren enlightened by sja-anat. similarly, when some entity possesses or has a strong influence over a person, the person's eyes will often grow red, as seen with the bodies on scadrial controlled by autonomy, the soldiers possessed via the thrill at the battle of thaylen field, and many of odium's servants, whose souls are corrupted by his power. ""“this is a powerful magic, and one where humans themselves have often had access to grand bursts of strength. i would challenge one to identify another planet, save only roshar, where one can find such strength of investiture so commonly in the hands of mortals.”-khriss on allomancy and feruchemy"" investiture can be divided into two categories: kinetic investiture and static investiture. kinetic investiture refers to investiture actively doing something. when investiture is kinetic, it can often be detected by various methods, such as allomantic bronze or sand from the dayside of taldain. static investiture refers to all investiture not actively doing something, such as a feruchemical charge in a metalmind. at least some forms of static investiture, including lights not actively powering anything, can also be detected by taldain's sand, though they affect the sand much more slowly than kinetic investiture does. the term innate investiture denotes a direct conduit between a person and the spiritual realm, such as the piece of preservation in all scadrians or breath, and would likely be a subcategory of static investiture. cosmere scholars term the various methods of utilizing investiture (such as the metallic arts, surgebinding, and awakening) invested arts. since the shattering, these can be grouped into three main categories. the most common are those powered directly by the shards, which arise from the interactions between a shard and the planet they are invested in. such invested arts are capable of far more spectacular results than other invested arts. if a planet does not have a shard in residence, its inhabitants can still access and use investiture by the ordinary laws of realmatics, but, without a shard to provide additional power, the results are far more limited. the last category is the few invested arts left over from before the shattering of adonalsium, of which the only known example is yolish lightweaving. anti-investiture[edit] much like there is both matter and antimatter, at least some forms of investiture can be transformed into a substance known as anti-investiture. currently, the only known forms of anti-investiture are anti-stormlight and anti-voidlight, which can be made by at least partially isolating stormlight or voidlight respectively from their shard's pure tone and then exposing it to their shard's opposite tone; khriss seems to believe additional forms of anti-investiture are possible. anti-voidlight, at least, looks mostly similar to regular voidlight, but appears to warp the air around it. when anti-investiture mixes with investiture of the same type, the two annihilate in a violent explosion; if the investiture in question is the soul of a person or that of an entity composed entirely of investiture, like a spren, then this annihilation results in their permanent death. perpendicularities[edit] ""“anytime too much power-too much investiture, too much self-congregated, realms became porous and time behaved oddly. ”-sylphrena on entering the centerbeat of the highstorm"" when a sufficient amount of investiture coalesces in one place in the physical and cognitive realms, it creates a junction between all three realms known as a perpendicularity. most stable perpendicularities form from the presence of a shard on a planet and the massive amount of investiture they bring with them. sentient beings can use perpendicularities to travel between the physical and cognitive realms, which in turn facilitates easier travel on and off a planet for those with the knowledge to use them. adonalsium[edit] ""“there was a god. adonalsium. i don’t know if it was a force or a being, though i suspect the latter. ”-khriss on adonalsium"" when the cosmere began, there was an entity known as adonalsium; this entity is widely believed to have created the cosmere. perhaps for this reason, adonalsium is sometimes referred to as ""the power of creation."" investiture was adonalsium's power, which has led cosmere scholars to conclude that either investiture seeks intelligence because it used to be adonalsium or that adonalsium came into being because investiture sought intelligence. the exact nature of adonalsium, however, remains unclear. it may have been a mere force that acted according to specific rules or an actual entity that could think on its own; khriss suspects the latter. the way adonalsium saw the cosmere was simply the way its magic worked. for example, the spren on roshar could not form fabrials prior to the shattering because adonalsium did not want them to be able to do so. given adonalsium had this level of control over the cosmere, some have suggested that adonalsium may have wanted the shattering to occur. some say there are ""subtle forces"" being manifest in the cosmere, separate from adonalsium, likely referring to belief in the god beyond. shards of adonalsium[edit] ""“[odium] is far greater than i, but the power of ancient adonalsium permeates him. and controls him. odium is a force like pressure, gravitation, or the movement of time. these things cannot break their own rules. nor can he. ”-the stormfather on shards of adonalsium"" during the shattering, adonalsium split into sixteen pieces, referred to as shards of adonalsium. each of these shards has an intent that represents a particular facet of adonalsium. sixteen people involved in the shattering then took up those shards, becoming the first vessels and effectively ascending to godhood. there was some sort of force or property of the cosmere that caused adonalsium to shatter into the sixteen shards that it did, and the distribution of the shards to the vessels was not random. the number sixteen has some significance to the mechanics of the cosmere, though, as adonalsium could have split into some other number of shards, it may have only become significant after the shattering, and indeed may arise more from the beliefs of sapient creatures than a greater underlying property. though the power of a shard requires a mind to control it, known as a vessel, the intent of a shard will slowly warp the minds of those that hold it, overriding their independence. for example, after leras ascended as preservation, he became unable to cause harm, even to preserve other things. it is unclear whether the original vessels knew this when they took up their shards, but, eventually, the vessels came to be known simply by their shard's name. the shards have access to infinite power, but the vessels' minds, even though they are expanded by holding the shard, are not capable of wielding it all at once. the shards are also limited by certain rules that restrict how they can act; for example, they must fulfill a formally made oath. failing to do so can give others an opening to act against the shard who broke an oath; this has, on at least one occasion, resulted in the death of a vessel. shards can also intervene to block another shard's actions, though not perfectly. despite these restrictions, however, the shards are generally capable of both subtle and incredible changes. among other things, they can change the orbit of entire planets, make changes to individuals and entire species on a genetic level, and alter some of the mechanics of an invested art resulting from their presence on a planet. since shards exist primarily in the spiritual realm, they also have some ability to look into the future, though not all shards are equally good at this and it fragments into more and more possibilities the further they look. shards can also create avatars, beings with access to a portion of the shard's power who can act autonomously from their shard, but remain part of the shard and ultimately cannot act against the shard's instructions. avatars stand in contrast to splinters, who are pieces of a shard's power that have or could develop free will. avatars often seem to be used when a shard wants to influence events on a planet other than the one they are primarily invested in; for example, autonomy, who is invested in taldain, has avatars on first of the sun and obrodai. since the shattering, the shards have been the primary source of magic in the cosmere. the interactions between their investiture and a planet give rise to invested arts that are far more powerful than those formed by people accessing background investiture. each shard also has its own pure tone and rhythm, that can often influence and be heard emanating from their investiture and can become part of the worlds they invest in. for example, the lights of roshar pulse softly to their shard's tone and rhythm and will follow a source-vocal or instrumental-generating their shard's tone and both the well of ascension on scadrial and the pulses a seeker can pick up from someone using allomancy are related to preservation's tone and rhythm. harmonizing the tones and rhythms of two different shards is part of the creation of hybrid investiture, like warlight and towerlight. shards also have an opposite tone, which sounds identical to most people but is unpleasant to those attuned to that shard's investiture, and can only be created by intent. this opposite tone can physically repel its shard's investiture and can help create anti-investiture associated with its shard. planets[edit] ""“other planets ... yes, there are dozens of them. many are inhabited by people much like you or me. there is an original, shrouded and hidden somewhere in the cosmere. i’ve yet to find it, but i have found stories. ”-khriss to kelsier"" while the cosmere has a wide array of planets, many of them are uninhabited, not significantly invested, or otherwise not generally relevant to the broader cosmere. planets in the cosmere have something akin to souls, likely referring to their presence in the cognitive and/or spiritual realms. primary worlds[edit] nalthis is a world of color. color is needed to fuel its magic system, awakening, and those with large amounts of breath will enhance the colors around them and can see perfect shades of colors. when someone dies, endowment, the resident shard, occasionally sends their cognitive shadow back as a returned to prevent a tragedy they forsee after their death. the rosharan system consists of three planets of note. ashyn was nearly destroyed in an apocalypse long ago, though a few cities remain floating in the atmosphere. certain bacteria on the planet are able to grant magical powers, including the ability to keep the floating cities aloft. roshar is a planet with a powerful storm that frequently blows across the continent and where spren can cross into the physical realm. braize is the prison of the fused where the heralds are tortured between desolations. scadrial is the most technologically advanced planet and the most similar to yolen. its three magic systems all use metal to store and access investiture. sel, also known as seol, is a large planet with three great domains. it has many magic systems, which are tied to the user's location and are accessed by creating shapes in the proper form, rather like programming. the planet taldain is tidally locked between two stars, a blue-white supergiant and a white dwarf. the side of the planet facing the former, dayside, is a vast desert where investiture arrives from the light of the star. darkside faces the white dwarf, leaving it in perpetual twilight; many things there fluoresce in ultraviolet light. its shard, autonomy, keeps the planet isolated from the rest of the cosmere. other notable worlds[edit] canticle is an extremely small planet with a dense, invested core. the light of the system's host star is also invested; when that light reaches the surface of canticle, it is quickly pulled down to the planet's core, superheating everything in its path. as a result, people living on the planet must keep moving constantly in order to stay ahead of the sunrise. the drominad system is home to several planets, all of which have water as a dominant feature. three of them are inhabited by humans, the most of any planetary system in the cosmere at the time khriss wrote her essay on the system. the innermost planet, first of the sun has a perpendicularity, though the region around it in the physical realm is incredibly dangerous. lumar is a backwater planet that is home to the aether spores, a compressed form of aether that grows dangerously fast when touched by water, which are produced by a variant strain of the aethers on the twelve moons that hang close to the surface of the planet. threnody is a planet with two principal parts: the fallen world, which is under the control of an unknown entity called the evil that is so dangerous that everyone left, and the forests of hell, which is home to dangerous cognitive shadows known as shades. perpendicularities on threnody are unstable and have a morbid origin. the utol system is located near where the shard virtuosity splintered herself and home to two habitable planets. the eponymous planet of utol is a water-dominated planet inhabited by sho del that seems to be well-known in the cosmere by the space age. its sister planet komashi is home to humans and splinters of virtuosity known as hijo; before the destruction of the father machine, it was notable for an eternal shroud of black investiture covering the planet. yolen is the original planet of humans and the location of the shattering. it has few inhabitants in the modern era and has been hidden from most of the people of the cosmere. little is known about bjendal, mythos, obrodai and vax. additionally, there is the home planet of the aethers, which could possibly be bjendal, obrodai, or vax. history[edit] before the shattering[edit] ""“it was a distant place where two lands meet and gods have died. ”-hoid on pre-shattering yolen."" at some point, the dawnshards were used to create the cosmere. the first humans lived on yolen and were created by adonalsium. at some point, a poorly-understood and parasitic ecosystem hostile to humans, known as fainlife, began to develop on yolen. it began to spread and overtake the landscape, though the other inhabitants eventually learned how to keep it in check. plants and land overtaken by fainlife retain their shape, but turn bone-white and spill red liquid when crushed or snapped. yolen was also home to sho del, the fainlife equivalent of humans, and dragons. information about fainlife remains accessible enough in the modern cosmere that khriss was able to mention it to cosmere-aware people without need for explanation. prior to the shattering, yolen's technology was likely pre-industrial. most of the other planets in the cosmere existed and were named prior to the shattering, though worldhopping was much less common at the time. during this time, adonalsium created the entire rosharan system and grew the supercontinent on the planet roshar; as a result, the continent is shaped like the two-dimensional projection of a julia set. investiture still existed prior to the shattering, though its form was different. during this time, there was a plot to destroy adonalsium, but it failed. hoid, the dragon frost, and the original vessels all lived before the shattering. the shattering of adonalsium[edit] ""“sixteen people, together, killed adonalsium, ripping it apart and dividing its essence between them, becoming the first who ascended. [they were] a diverse group, with equally diverse motives. some wished for the power; others saw killing adonalsium as the only good option left to them. together they murdered a deity, and became divine themselves. ”-khriss on the original vessels"" eventually, a group of people that opposed adonalsium came together and plotted its destruction. this group included people of all three sapient species on yolen: humans, dragons, and sho del. to achieve their goal, they created a weapon that utilized the dawnshards. in an event known as the shattering of adonalsium, the weapon was used to ""undo"" adonalsium, splitting it into the sixteen shards; the weapon was expended in the process, though remnants of it exist in the physical realm and are responsible for hoid's immortality. as part of the shattering, sixteen of the people who had opposed adonalsium took up the new shards and became the first vessels. there was some sort of force that caused adonalsium to shatter into the shards that it did, and the distribution of the shards to the vessels was not random. the shattering occurred on yolen, though there is some ""weirdness"" with regard to yolen and location, and occurred all at once. as a result of the shattering, all investiture in the cosmere became aligned with one of the sixteen shards. hoid was loosely involved in the plot to shatter adonalsium and was present at the shattering. he also had the opportunity to take a shard, but turned it down. he and frost both knew the original vessels personally. after the shattering, the new vessels made some sort of agreement to not interfere with each other, though the exact agreement was somewhat ambiguous and the vessels who suggested it did not make sure to get a formal oath from the others. regardless, the shards then went their separate ways. most settled on a planet, though virtuosity instead chose to instead travel around the cosmere before eventually splintering herself near the utol system. some chose to go off on their own, while others stayed together with other shards. around this time, ruin and preservation created the planet scadrial, using the non-fain parts of yolen as a guide. odium's quest[edit] ""“one need only look at the aftermath of his brief visit to sel to see proof of what i say. in case you have turned a blind eye to that disaster, know that aona and skai are both dead, and that which they held has been splintered. presumably to prevent anyone from rising up to challenge rayse. ”-hoid on odium in his letter to frost"" soon after the shattering, or possibly even beforehand, the vessel of odium, rayse, decided he wanted to become the strongest being in the cosmere. however, odium is, by its nature, selfish and rayse did not want the intent of an additional shard to make him into something else, so he instead decided to destroy the other shards so that there would be no one left to challenge him. to do so, he developed a way to splinter a shard's power, which also results in the death of its vessel. ""“he bears the weight of god's own divine hatred, separated from the virtues that gave it context. he is what we made him to be, old friend. and that is what he, unfortunately, wished to become.”-frost on odium in his reply to hoid"" odium's first target was ambition, as he feared that it would be a threat to him. however, while searching for ambition, he encountered the shards devotion and dominion on sel and attacked them, likely because he could argue they had violated the vessel's pact to not interfere with each other. in the ensuing battle, odium successfully splintered devotion and dominion and killed their vessels, aona and skai. in order to ensure that no one could take up their shards, he then somehow moved most of their investiture from the spiritual realm into the cognitive realm, which made the selish cognitive realm incredibly dangerous and the selish invested arts location-dependent. sometime after he splintered devotion and dominion, odium finally found ambition, who had settled in the threnodite system. odium attacked and mortally wounded ambition, though the shard fled and was ultimately splintered elsewhere, in a battle with odium and mercy. these clashes resulted in a wound in the spiritual realm and left ripped-off chunks of ambition's power in the threnodite system, which twisted the people and planet of threnody. sometime after honor and cultivation arrived on roshar, odium traveled to the rosharan system. odium never intended to invest himself in a planet, but, at some point, he became invested in the rosharan system to the point where he would now have to leave some of his power behind or forcibly tear it out in order to leave. at some point while he was in the system, honor and cultivation used their power to trap him in the system. as a result, odium has since been waging a war to free himself from whatever binds him to the system so that he can continue his quest. to that end, he splintered off pieces of his power to create the fused, the unmade, and voidspren, and also invested in the rosharan system enough to create and grant access to invested art known as voidbinding. when the fused first appeared, honor created the heralds, who could seal the fused on braize, though the fused tortured the heralds into allowing them to return to roshar. every time a herald broke, a desolation would begin and the heralds and knights radiant would fight the fused until they could be sealed on braize again. this situation continued for millennia and the shards remained at a stalemate, especially after nine of the heralds abandoned the oathpact, leaving it to talenel alone, who was better able to withstand the torture on braize. as a result of his past clashes with shards, odium has ""scars that do not heal,"" which makes him more careful about future engagements. many of the other shards are aware of odium's actions, though most do not seem to consider him a problem, as long as he remains bound to the rosharan system. endowment is currently indifferent to him and thinks he was justified in splintering the shards he did; she also believes she could ""deal"" with him if he becomes an issue. one of autonomy's avatars, patji, also expressed indifference, though he did indicate that a different avatar might be more receptive. there is also a shard who just wants to survive that is aware of odium's goals and is ""smart enough"" to stay away, though they have realized over time that may not be the best course of action. harmony, who only became aware of the threat around the time of the true desolation, is deeply concerned about odium, but is unable to do much because of the conflicting nature of his powers. in a letter to hoid, however, he did suggest that valor might share some of his concern. the ascension of harmony[edit] early in the history of scadrial, preservation's vessel, leras, sacrificed most of his consciousness to imprison ruin's mind in the well of ascension, preventing him from destroying the planet. in the process, preservation also stole a piece of ruin's power and crafted the pits of hathsin to hide it; the concentration of investiture there formed a perpendicularity, which came to support an extensive system of interplanetary trade until kelsier shattered all of the atium geodes in the pits in 1022 fe. after the death of the lord ruler, ruin was successfully able to manipulate vin into taking up the well's power and then releasing it, which allowed him to be free. once free, ruin was unable to immediately splinter preservation, but brought his power to bear against what remained of leras, slowly killing the vessel. the ire, aware of leras's impending death, sought to use a device to connect one of their members to preservation and ascend. the device, however, was stolen by kelsier, who used it after leras finally died, taking up the portion of preservation's power that leras had still been holding and preventing ruin from splintering preservation. kelsier continued to hold that power until vin, leras's chosen successor, had her link to ruin-a hemalurgically charged earring-removed, whereupon she began absorbing the mists and kelsier released the portion of preservation's power he held, allowing vin to ascend and became the vessel of preservation. during the battle of hathsin, vin then sacrificed herself in order to kill ruin's vessel, ati. leras, when he held preservation's power, had foreseen all this and planned for both ruin and preservation to be left without a vessel so that sazed could take up both shards and their intents could moderate each other. as a result of one person holding both shards, ruin and preservation's power began to intermingle, and sazed became known as harmony. it is considered a single shard, much like a king of two countries is still just one king. this consolidation of two shards with one vessel caused some of the other shards-notably odium and autonomy-to feel threatened or even scared and to begin making plans for dealing with harmony. splintering of honor and the true desolation[edit] sometime after the recreance, odium finally managed to splinter honor, even though cultivation was assisting honor in some way. honor, however, had prepared for this eventuality by, among other things, giving the stormfather the power to create new honorspren and recording a series of visions for the stormfather to show to potential bondsmiths. approximately 4,500 years after the last desolation, odium and his servants developed the everstorm to allow the fused to circumvent the oathpact and return to roshar without talenel breaking. as odium's forces grew closer to enacting their plan, hoid began reaching out to the dragon frost and several of the shards, asking them to help in keeping the cosmere safe from odium. aside from harmony, who had not previously been aware of the threat odium posed, they all rejected hoid's request as they considered odium's binding to the rosharan system sufficient. after years of preparation, odium's servants successfully guided the listeners to summoning the everstorm, beginning the true desolation. with the advent of the everstorm, dalinar kholin founded a coalition of monarchs to oppose odium's forces and the knights radiant were re-established. acting on the advice honor had left in his series of visions, they pushed odium to agree to a contest of champions so that he could be forced to leave roshar in peace for some period of time. odium eventually agreed to such a contest during the battle of thaylen field, but withdrew before the terms for the contest could be set. about a year later, odium returned to set the terms for the contest. ultimately he and dalinar agreed that, no matter the outcome of the contest, odium would remain bound to the rosharan system and would cease hostilities against the coalition of monarchs, with only the fate of alethkar, herdaz, and dalinar's soul depending on the outcome of the contest. the protections specified for hoid in dalinar's initial, written, proposed contract also appear to be in effect. the contest is set for the tenth hour of the tenth day of the month palah at the top of urithiru. shortly after odium came to this agreement with dalinar, taravangian orchestrated an attack on odium with nightblood, which killed odium's vessel, rayse. taravangian then ascended as the new vessel of odium; he remains bound by the agreement rayse made with dalinar and plans to beat dalinar. trell and scadrial[edit] sometime after the catacendre, kelsier founded the ghostbloods for the purpose of protecting scadrial. as a result of the moves he was making, others began reaching out to the rest of the cosmere for power, though they were not fully aware what they were doing. their calls were answered by the shard autonomy, who began to make good on the ancient religion of trelagism that she had founded in the classical era of scadrial and to create a new avatar of herself on scadrial, trell. she backed the set and the kandra paalm in their efforts to break scadrial from harmony's influence and bring it under her control, while also preparing to destroy the planet if necessary to prevent it from becoming a threat. as autonomy's plans neared completion, she trapped harmony in a shroud that sharply limited his ability to see the future and prepared the leader of the set, telsin ladrian to become the avatar trell. both of her plans for scadrial were ultimately stopped, as waxillium ladrian and wayne killed telsin and prematurely detonated the bomb planned to destroy elendel while marasi colms, with help from the ghostbloods, drained and collapsed the perpendicularity autonomy had created for her men of gold and red to travel through, preventing them from destroying the planet. autonomy then withdrew from scadrial, saying that they had proven themselves for the moment. worldhoppers[edit] some people who are aware of the broader cosmere have learned how to travel between planets and are known as worldhoppers. since space in the cognitive realm is linked to how people think about that region, most of outer space is extremely compressed in the cognitive realm. therefore, if one could shift from the physical to the cognitive realm, they could quickly travel between planets. the most common method for transfer to the cognitive realm is by going through a perpendicularity, though it is also possible with the surge of transportation. planets are not equally easy to access through the cognitive realm and planets may rapidly become less accessible due to local events. while nalthis is generally easy and safe to reach, and even has customs for travelers to go through, it seems to be more of an outlier in this regard-travel to sel is incredibly dangerous due to the power of devotion and dominion being stuck in the cognitive realm, a well-established mercantile system running through ruin's perpendicularity on scadrial is upended overnight when kelsier destroys the atium in the pits of hathsin, roshar fluctuates between being welcoming and being dangerous, depending on the stage of the conflict between honor and odium, taldain is inaccessible as autonomy has closed it off from the rest of the cosmere, and travel to bjendal is disrupted by unknown events. as a result of these difficulties, people look for other methods of travel. while it may be possible to worldhop using the spiritual realm, the primary other method available is faster-than-light travel through space in the physical realm. there are multiple ways to create ships that are capable of such travel; the surge of transportation and allomancy both provide viable bases for developing ships that can do so, though the exact mechanics are unknown. in total, the number of people traveling between planets probably numbers somewhere in the thousands, though this may increase after the development of faster-than-light travel through the physical realm. some of these people are involved in the broader events of the cosmere, but many just want to immigrate to another planet. there is no universal language that all worldhoppers speak, though some can use connection to speak local languages. these worldhoppers drive a thriving interplanetary trade system that includes the trade of mundane objects from different worlds, rare items like paintings from the court of the gods, and at least one courier service. the most important commodity, however, is investiture, though it is difficult to transport off of its home world as it is strongly connected to that world and its shard. hoid[edit] ""“for i have never been dedicated to a more important purpose, and the very pillars of the sky will shake with the results of our war here. i ask again. support me. do not stand aside and let disaster consume more lives. ”-hoid on his opposition to odium"" hoid is a mysterious worldhopper who has been alive since before the shattering of adonalsium and was present for that event. he has collected a variety of invested items from around the cosmere and gained access to multiple invested arts. his long-term goals are unclear, but he is an adamant opponent of odium's attempts to become the sole god of the cosmere. he has written to frost, endowment, autonomy, and harmony, hoping to enlist their help in dealing with odium, though only harmony has responded positively. he has some ability to manipulate fortune, which lets him learn where and when he needs to be to advance his goals, though he often doesn't know why being somewhere is important. worldhopping groups[edit] the seventeenth shard[edit] ""“however, it seems to me that all things have been set up for a purpose, and if we-as infants-stumble through the workshop, we risk exacerbating, not preventing, a problem. ”-frost to hoid on his non-intervention policy"" the seventeenth shard is a group of worldhoppers that seeks to research and study the various worlds of the cosmere without interfering in existing cultures. they believe the shards separated for a reason and want to minimize the risk of conflict between the shards. frost may have some influence over them, either formally or informally. they are worried about hoid, as they fear his actions on planets will exacerbate shardic conflict and, from at least 1173 to 1175 on the rosharan calendar, unsuccessfully tried to hunt him down, though they have larger objectives as well. silverlight[edit] silverlight is a fully-functional city in the cognitive realm where many worldhoppers have settled down. its population, however, also includes many people who are born in the city and spend their entire lives there, including a notable group of southern scadrians. the city is home to multiple universities, whose scholars possess a great deal of knowledge about the nature of the cosmere and will conduct expeditions to investigate unusual workings of investiture to further that knowledge. at least one of those universities was founded by the researcher khriss, the most knowledgeable person in the cosmere and author of the ars arcana. as a result of these efforts and playing host to interactions between societies from across the cosmere, silverlight enjoys scientific learning and progress that is without parallel in the rest of the cosmere. the city is also home to at least one mercantile enterprise, whose services include an interplanetary postal service that makes use of unknown invested entities that read connection to find the location of message recipients. the ire[edit] ""“perhaps the ire know more [about investiture on sel], but they are not speaking on the topic and have repeatedly denied my requests for collaboration. ”-khriss on the ire"" the ire is a group of worldhopping elantrians. they existed prior to the reod and were able to weather it, though they were off-world when it occurred. their objectives are unclear, though they did attempt to ascend one of their members as the vessel of preservation after leras died. at that time, they were at least associated with a group whose forces were keeping the shades of threnody contained in the threnodite system. they have some method of storing and transporting investiture, which they use to sustain themselves and trade with others, such as the honorspren of lasting integrity. the ghostbloods[edit] the ghostbloods is a cosmere-wide secret society created by kelsier for the purpose of protecting scadrial from other forces in the cosmere. to that end, they seek to push technological progress forward and build alliances with other planets. they have recruited several worldhoppers and actively recruit from the seventeenth shard's field agents, though the two organizations do not work together. they have also recruited at least one sleepless, though they are also worried about the sleepless trying to take over their organization. the ghostbloods on roshar are working on finding a way to transport stormlight from roshar, where it is easily accessible, to places where investiture is harder to obtain, though members operating beyond scadrial are somewhat removed from kelsier's direct control. other notable worldhoppers[edit] most, if not all, of the five scholars of nalthis were worldhoppers and are well-regarded by the cosmere-aware scholarly community as pioneers of the study of investiture and realmatic theory. after learning from one of the scholars, vasher, vivenna became a worldhopper as well. felt was involved in trade through the pits of hathsin and has been involved in several different worldhopping groups over the years. the dragon frost is extremely knowledgeable about the cosmere, but is not actually a worldhopper, as he has not left yolen. the sleepless are present on several planets across the cosmere, though most have chosen to settle on roshar and only the rosharan ones are capable of imitating humans. additionally, there are several kandra from scadrial who have become worldhoppers, though they were released from their contract with harmony sometime after autonomy's initial incursion on scadrial. development[edit] ""“during my unpublished days i wrote thirteen books, only one of which was a sequel. ... but i wanted to be writing big epics. this is what i always wanted to do; something like the wheel of time. so i began plotting a large, massive series where all these books were connected, so i could kind of ""stealth"" have a large series without the editors knowing i was sending them books from the same series. it was mostly just a thing for me, to help me do the writing i wanted to be doing. and then when publication came i continued to do that, and told the story behind the story.”-brandon on the beginnings of the cosmere"" when brandon was beginning to write and trying to get published, he loved gigantic epic fantasy series. he knew, however, that starting with a big series might not be the best idea. if he wrote four books in a series, and the first one didn't get published, he couldn't submit his sequels, so he decided instead to focus on standalone stories. however, he still loved the idea of a huge epic series, so he decided to create a ""hidden"" epic to link his novels together. brandon had seen other authors who made a single universe for all their books, like isaac asimov, but didn't like how asimov had to retcon and shoehorn things together to connect his books, and so wanted to build the cosmere from the beginning, so it would always be consistent. some ideas that came into the worldbuilding of the cosmere came from plato's theory of forms, which contributed to the development of realmatic theory. in this, the distinction of what is perceived as ""ideal"" and what is the true ideal is important: true ideals have much to do with the spiritual realm, while people's perception of ideals deals with the cognitive realm. another influence is spinoza, with the idea that god is in everything. brandon also incorporated the idea of a ""unifying theory of everything"" from physics into the magic in the cosmere. all magics have underlying rules, and are derived from a single unified theory of magic. ""“i hope that people will stick with me for all these books, because i'll do a lot of them. but they will fit together in some really cool ways once they are all done. i think you'll be very very impressed, but that's a while off.”-brandon on the cosmere"" the cosmere sequence has a clear story that brandon wants to tell and is fairly firmly outlined as 35 novels, plus a variety of novellas and other works, with the dragonsteel series, mistborn series, and the stormlight archive forming the core of that story. dragonsteel will tell hoid's backstory and the story of the shattering of adonalsium; mistborn will have four series, following scadrial from the final empire to the development of faster-than-light travel and the interaction between the various planets; the stormlight archive will be split into two arcs of five books each and is the story of the clash between the people of roshar and odium. generally, knowledge of the cosmere as a whole will not be necessary until dragonsteel and the final mistborn trilogy, which are the beginning and the conclusion respectively of the cosmere sequence brandon does not feel that the cosmere is restrictive to his writing. though cosmere novels are intensive, as they require more thorough planning and continuity maintenance, brandon also has an internal wiki and people like peter and karen ahlstrom who help him keep the cosmere on track. when brandon feels like he needs a break from the more stringent requirements of the cosmere, he'll turn to work on a less intensive novel or novella, which are almost always non-cosmere. if there is a concept he really wants to write but doesn't fit in the limitations of the cosmere, he moves it into a non-cosmere book. for example, the rithmatist started as a cosmere novel, and its magics take many elements from cosmere magics, but brandon decided that he did not want a version of earth in the cosmere, and so moved it to its own universe. brandon does generally plan out which cosmere hints to give to fans, but sometimes he gives hints on the fly. usually, fans are able to pry much more than he initially intended to tell. bibliography of the cosmere[edit] forthcoming[edit] the following are confirmed upcoming cosmere stories: - , - the working title of a stormlight novella following - , possibly to be written for the - leatherbound kickstarter in 2023. - , the last book of the first arc of - . - writing began in late 2021 or early 2022, - but has been delayed by other projects, and the book is expected to be released in 2024. - , the next mistborn series, set to take place when scadrial has achieved a technology level similar to that of the 1980s. - planned to be written in the break between books 5 and 6 of the stormlight archive. - brandon hopes to write all three books before the first one is released, like he did with era 1. - and - , the sequels to - . expected to be written after the stormlight archive book 5 and - era 2 are done. - ""in a perfect world,"" brandon would write them around the same time he writes - era 3, but they may come later than that. - the second arc of - , which will consist of books six through ten of the series overall. in-world, book six will pick up about a decade after book five ends. - planned to be written after - era 3 and possibly also the - sequels are done. - , the sequel to - . likely won't be written until the stormlight archive book 5, the - sequels, and - era 3 are written. - the - , the origin story of - and the - of - . brandon is loosely working on it, but the series will not be written until the stormlight archive is finished. - , the science fiction trilogy, with - as a main character. - chronologically, this will be the last series in the cosmere sequence, and has much to do with the worlds coming together. chronological order[edit] brandon has been somewhat evasive about the order of cosmere stories, so that the timeline remains flexible for future books that he writes. he has estimated that there are roughly 6000 years between the shattering and the breaking of the oathpact, with the latter event still predating white sand. although this figure is non-canonical and subject to change, brandon has also stated that the books have mostly been released chronologically, which allows a rough timeline to be constructed: - and - and - planetary system essays - (books 1 through 5) - (books 6 through 10) further reading[edit] notes[edit]"
Shattering,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Shattering_of_Adonalsium,"""“sixteen people, together, killed adonalsium, ripping it apart and dividing its essence between them, becoming the first who ascended. ”-khriss on the shattering"" the shattering of adonalsium (or simply, the shattering) was a pivotal moment in the history of the cosmere when adonalsium was killed using the dawnshards. prior to this, there were no shards, which have been the dominant influence in the cosmere we've seen so far. it takes place roughly ten thousand years before the rebellion against the cinder king on canticle. prior to the shattering[edit] it is not clear how different the cosmere was prior to the shattering, but the shattering did have an effect on the magic. an example is the highstorms, natural phenomena that are central to the life cycle of many of the native inhabitants of roshar; the highstorms were later infused with the power of honor. participants and aftereffects[edit] the people who killed adonalsium all had different motivations, including a desire for power and a belief in the necessity of the action. hoid was there at the shattering and was offered a shard, but he refused. hoid participated in the plan to kill adonalsium. all of the investiture in the cosmere was divided between and became associated with a shard, with some exceptions like the aethers and the dawnshards. all of the sixteen shards were created at once, and they all started with the same amount of investiture. it was not random which vessel got which shard; some chose shards that they were particularly connected with, while others chose shards that they believed they could control well. the shattering happened on yolen. it is possible for adonalsium to have shattered into different shards than the shards currently in existence. following the shattering, the vessels spread across the cosmere, investing into various planets, with ruin and preservation themselves creating the planet of scadrial. various shards fought amongst themselves for various reasons, leading to the death of vessels and splintering of the shards. in particularly, this applies to devotion, dominion, honor, and ambition. all of these splinterings had strong and lasting effects upon the planets they were invested within, and are also largely the result of odium having gone to kill every shard he could. ruin and preservation were also later fused into one vessel after the death of their previous holders, creating the hybrid shard, harmony. notes[edit]"
Shard,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Shard,"""“the shards are not god, but they are pieces of god. ruin, preservation, autonomy, cultivation, devotion...there are sixteen of them. ”-khriss"" the shards of adonalsium, or shards for short, are sixteen pieces of the power of creation. they are each named after a specific characteristic or ideal that represents the shard's primary purpose or motivation. a person who has taken up the power of a shard is the vessel of that shard. the shards are the most powerful known entities in the cosmere, and for all intents and purposes, serve as the gods of the cosmere. most if not all magic systems are related to them. introduction[edit] ""“ruin and preservation inhabited power and energy in the same way a person inhabits flesh and blood. ”-sazed"" power[edit] each shard is a piece of the power of creation with a specific motivation, such as to destroy or to preserve. those fragments each began their existence with equal level of power; however, over time many have diminished, whether through conflict or by the act of investing a world -- imbuing it with investiture. each shard has its own investiture; while a shard can co-opt the investiture of another shard, that investiture can become noticeably red. investing in a world will produce numerous effects, most notably the creation of a magic system tied to the shard. while a shard doesn't have complete control over how the magic system functions or what it does, it can manipulate its mechanics to an extent. moreover, the presence of a shard leads to the formation of a perpendicularity, a well of the shard's investiture that pierces all three realms, allowing for worldhopping. the shard's investiture can also manifest directly in the world in other ways; examples of such manifestations are atium and lerasium on scadrial, the tears of edgli on nalthis, or the many spren of roshar. it is possible for a shard to be broken down into multiple smaller shards with different intents. it is currently unknown whether this has ever happened before, or how it would be accomplished. vessel[edit] to function properly, a shard requires a vessel -- a mind to control it, belonging to a sapient creature from the physical realm, such as a human. currently, there is only one shard held by a dragon (cultivation). one doesn't need to be able to use investiture in order to become a vessel, but the ability does help. what becoming a vessel requires above all is connection to the shard in question, whether forged artificially or driven by a natural inclination towards the shard's intent. upon ascension, a vessel loses its connection to its former species -- for example, a human who ascended is no longer considered human. however, it is possible for vessels to reproduce. the act of becoming a vessel is called ascension, and causes the vessel's body to vaporize and mind to expand. from then on, the vessel and the shard are intertwined; the vessel gets to set some general course of how the shard's power is defined, and feeds off the shard's power to remain alive, but the shard's power is the driving force between the two. over centuries, the vessel's mind begins to change to fit the shard's intent more perfectly. if a vessel fights against their shards intent, they can be left vulnerable. if the vessel were to give up the shard, the shard's influence on their mind would fade over time. a shard can be killed by splintering it, breaking its power down further into smaller pieces, called splinters; the easiest way to achieve that is by killing the mind. the actual death of a vessel, however, can take up to hundreds of years. if the shard is taken up before the vessel dies completely, splintering can be prevented; if not, the power will become wild and dangerous. a shard without a vessel will eventually gain sentience. when a vessel dies, the person's original body materializes and falls to the ground as a corpse. however, it does not age rapidly, since shardic immortality is different from other methods like atium compounding. it is possible for vessels to be separated from their shards without dying or splintering the shards they held. if this happens, then after the vessel's death, it is able to resist the pull into the beyond. a mentally ill vessel can affect the shard's intent. history[edit] ""“i have delved and searched, and have only been able to come up with a single name: adonalsium. who, or what, it was, i do not yet know. ”-sazed"" it is unknown what precisely adonalsium was, though it has been referred to numerous times as the power of creation, suggesting it to be the progenitor god of the cosmere. at some point in the distant past, on the planet of yolen, sixteen people conspired to kill it, and succeeded in an event known as the shattering of adonalsium. some of those people were romantically involved; others were related to each other. all of them were mortal at some point. following the shattering, the power that comprised adonalsium broke into sixteen pieces, each polarized to one particular aspect of it, such as ruin or endowment. those pieces, each equal in power, became known as the shards. the sixteen killers of adonalsium each took up one of the shards, ascending and becoming the first vessels. following their ascension, each of the vessels departed yolen. some settled on various planets, while others set no roots. at this time they all had an equal amount of power. originally, the shards made an agreement not to interfere with each other, but they did not make a formal oath and many of the shards chose not to keep to the agreement. additionally, honor felt he did not break the agreement by traveling with cultivation, suggesting the wording of the agreement may not have been as precise as shards like endowment thought. over the millennia, several shards have passed away, one way or another. the most common cause of death for them were actions of one specific shard, odium, who went on a killing spree, splintering ambition, devotion, dominion and honor before eventually being trapped in the rosharan system by the remnants of the latter. the death of preservation's vessel, leras, led to the power being passed between several hands before it was eventually combined with ruin to form harmony. by contrast, autonomy spread, creating avatars to inhabit numerous planets, including obrodai and first of the sun. at least one of the vessels regrets taking up a shard, though which one that would be is unknown. there are living descendants of some of them still alive. at least one shard other than odium has been forced to leave their planet after its destruction. known shards[edit] there are sixteen original shards, fifteen of which are currently known. while most planets have at most one shard, sel and scadrial are both dishardic, hosting two shards each. roshar, on the other hand, is the only known example of a world influenced by three shards. original shards[edit] hybrid shards[edit] several of the known shards are dead in the current time, with ambition, virtuosity, honor, devotion and dominion all being splintered, with the remnants of devotion and dominion having been combined together in the cognitive realm as the dor. ruin and preservation, on the other hand, have blended together into harmony, albeit they remain somewhat separate within this unified construct. it is possible for the remnants of the shard honor to merge with odium to form a new shard. unnamed shard[edit] ""“some men, as they age, grow wiser. i am not one of those, for wisdom and i have always been at cross-purposes, and i have yet to learn the tongue in which she speaks. ”-hoid possibly implying the existence of another shard"" there remains one shard that has not been named, but it has an intent similar to wisdom or prudence. hoid and this shard may be antagonistic towards each other, though this appears to be something of a common thread in his relations with the original vessels. there is a shard that ""just wants to hide and survive,"" though it has realized over time that that may not be the most desirable course of action; this may be the ""wisdom"" shard. at one point, there was an unknown shard that does not inhabit a planet, which likely referred to virtuosity. similarly, at one point there was at least one unknown shard that had been splintered by odium, though the splintered shard ambition has been revealed since then. powers and abilities[edit] ""“the power of ancient adonalsium permeates him. and controls him. odium is a force like pressure, gravitation, or the movement of time. these things cannot break their own rules. nor can he. ”-stormfather"" shards possess incredible power -- a single shard can easily move entire planets and alter people down to the genetic level. they exist in all three realms, but unlike other living beings, the vast majority of their power is concentrated in the cognitive and spiritual. shards do not appear in the cognitive realm like other entities (such as a bead on roshar). time matters little to shards, and they can bend and stretch it as they wish. vessels also gain an immense amount of knowledge upon ascending, more than they can process immediately. they can gain more knowledge instantaneously, but this is not automatic, and requires them to consciously gain that knowledge. as investiture never truly goes away, a shard has access to a functionally-endless supply of it; however, there is a finite amount that a vessel can command at any one time. this means that while all investiture in the cosmere is assigned to one shard or another, a shard cannot truly command all of it at once. as such, while powerful, shards are not omniscient, omnipresent, nor omnipotent. a shard's power can be temporarily diminished, either by assigning it to living creatures (such as people or spren), or sending it back to the spiritual realm (e.g. burning atium). moreover, shards are, as powers, bound to follow higher rules; a deal, once made by a shard, cannot be broken, and they must absolutely obey the rules that govern them. breaking such deals will leave holes in them that another shard can exploit to kill them. each shard appears particularly predisposed toward acting in line with their intent; for example, preservation finds it nearly impossible to destroy, while it's extremely easy for ruin to do so. this is partially influenced by the personality change brought about by the shard. however, whether intentions provide shards with actual unique powers is unknown. individual powers[edit] movement[edit] shards are capable of appearing in various parts of their own invested worlds instantaneously. they can also travel to other planets by willing themselves to do so. however, when a shard invests its power in a world, it's bound to it and will have difficulty leaving the system it is in. shards can also trap each other in systems, though the precise mechanics of that are unknown. communication[edit] shards have several ways of communicating with people. some shards can speak directly into the minds of others, while others can listen. a shard can also communicate with a person directly through dreams or visions, and even take on a physical form -- a puppet of sorts, serving as a physical outlet for communication. while the use of visions and speaking directly into a mind are limited to a single person, a puppet can be seen by many people. a shard can also communicate directly with cognitive shadows. mind capacity[edit] upon ascension, the vessel's mind will be greatly expanded, allowing a far greater capacity to think than a mortal could. a shard is capable of bilocation -- being present in several places at once -- within its sphere of influence. as moments can pass like years to a shard, they can also appear to think far faster than normal minds. fundamental understanding of the cosmere, to the point of axi and anti-axi, also comes as a result. they seem to possess flawless memory, with no obvious upper limit, as sazed is able to absorb the tremendous amount of knowledge in his metalminds. however, contrary to what many believes, shards are neither omniscient nor omnipresent. they can only appear at limited places at once, and can be distracted, deceived or surprised. it is also possible to block a shard's senses away from a certain area. they are incapable of breaking a formal contract, at least not without seriously wounding themselves. creating sapience[edit] shards can use their power to create complex constructs, capable of continuing their function past the shard's death. examples of such constructs are the snapping mists of preservation, and the vision journal of honor. shards can also create sapient beings from their power -- this is most commonly seen on roshar, with its overabundance of spren. many of them, like the stormfather, nightwatcher, and honorspren were created by local shards. shards can also create avatars, personas that can act independently of them. avatars can be of any gender, race, and species, regardless of the original vessel creating them, and can be formed at a considerable distance from the main body of the shard, with many different avatars able to exist on a single planet. though a shard can create them directly, avatars can also form without a conscious decision on the shard's part, though the shard is still aware of what is happening. when created directly, however, they can be instilled with specific traits. some avatars are self-aware, while others are not, although the parent shard will always be aware. though some would call these avatars splinters, it is not clear whether they truly fit the definition. avatars are, in a way, considered to be shards in their own right. known ones include patji and the sand lord, both of autonomy. it is difficult but possible for someone to become a vessel of an avatar. shardic power is also directly related to sentience and sapience. the close presence of a particular shard, such as cultivation, can lead to some beings developing higher levels of sapience. shardic power can also grant sentience directly -- scadrians are sapient due to preservation's power within them, and nightblood's sapience is partially derived from his large quantity of breaths. splinters can also become sapient. even the raw power of a shard, if left alone and without a vessel, will eventually begin to form a rudimentary mind. magic generation[edit] when a shard invests a world, it will begin to fuel the local magic system. each shard can do this differently, though much of the system is dictated by the planet itself. because of this connection to the magic, a shard is able to directly interact with its users and provide investiture when necessary, without the need for intermediaries. while not all magic systems in the cosmere are directly tied to a shard, shardic presence greatly influences the shape a magic system takes. on a planet inhabited by a shard, magic forms as a result of the interactions between a shard's power, realmatics, the world's natural inclinations and, in some cases, even genetics. for this reason, the exact function magic performs will not always be related to the shard's nature -- for example, surgebinding, despite being powered by honor, is capable of manipulating division, which controls separating things. however, how the magic is obtained is tied to the shard. hemalurgy demands that a person be destroyed, in line with the intent of ruin, while surgebinding demands forging bonds. shards are capable of tampering with investiture that does not belong to them. future sight[edit] ""“it's as if the future is a shattering window. the further you look, the more pieces that window breaks into. the near future can be anticipated, but the distant future… i can only guess. ”-honor"" shards can perceive the future, although it can be difficult for them. some are better at it than others, with cultivation and preservation being noted as particularly excelling. like all seers, shards can be wrong about both what they see and how they interpret it, although as a general rule they see further than non-shards. shardic power can also be utilized by others to perceive the future as they do: examples of this are atium, as well as the visions of the returned. both preservation and honor describe seeing the future as not one set path, but a tangled web of linked possibilities, as well as the circumstances necessary to bring them about, with some being more likely than others. as a result, predicting the future is not a straightforward process, and is not equally useful to all seers. upon ascension to odium, taravangian realized that there are possibilities of future that rayse had not seen, implying the future sight ability may be related to the vessel as well. it is theorized that a shard's intent may be tied to its proficiency with future sight. preservation, as a shard dedicated to keeping things existing, and cultivation, a shard dedicated to growing something in a desired form, would hold a natural interest in predicting what the future will hold which may make them more proficient with this ability. by contrast, a shard like ruin, which is interested only in destroying things, and honor, about holding to one's oaths, would not have ""seeing ahead"" as part of their nature. forms and subdivisions[edit] ""“i'm still a spren. i’m a little piece of god. ”-syl"" the raw investiture of a shard can take distinct forms and states. as a solid, the investiture is metallic, and is thus sometimes referred to as a god metal. examples of god metals are atium, lerasium, raysium, and the alloy of honor and cultivation that forms shardblades. god metals typically have properties within the metallic arts, regardless of what shard they're aligned with. shardic power is the most potent as a liquid. it typically coalesces in one place on a planet, forming a perpendicularity. a perpendicularity represents a tremendous amount of power, enough so to pierce all three realms, allowing people to slide between them. examples of such perpendicularities are the well of ascension, the pits of hathsin, or the lake. as a gas, the shardic power can take on a number of different functions. examples of investiture in gaseous forms include breath, stormlight, and preservation's mists. all can serve as fuel for magic. in both awakening and surgebinding, gaseous investiture is, in fact, the primary source of magic, but even in systems that use other substances, like allomancy, gaseous investiture can serve the same purpose. slivers[edit] a sliver is a person who has held the power of a shard, and then released it. this ""stretches"" a person's spiritweb, noticeably altering them. there is some grey area as to how much power one needs to have to be considered a sliver; however, a person who directly handled shardic power is the most straightforward example. the lord ruler and kelsier would both be considered slivers, while elantrians and returned would not. splinters[edit] a splinter is a fragment of a shard's power, similar to how a shard is a fragment of adonalsium's power. unlike slivers or cognitive shadows, splinters don't generally have a physical component. they often have a mind of their own, separate and distinct from that of their parent shard. they can form in two distinct ways: either by the shard being splintered (killed), or by the shard directly splitting off splinters of itself. under certain circumstances, a shard may be split and each resulting piece would gain an aspect of the original shard's intent. splinters can be comprised of the investiture of one or more shards. examples of splinters include the divine breath of the returned, aons within seons, and spren. it is possible to create a new shard from splinters of multiple other shards, though it is much more difficult than it sounds. a shard splintered beyond recognition could be reconstructed as a different shard, though this would require a great deal of effort and resources, such as the use of a dawnshard. champion[edit] it is possible for a shard to name a ""champion"" when making a deal with another shard. becoming a champion in this way is a formal event and requires some kind of contractual agreement. honor encourages dalinar kholin to try to get odium to agree to a contest of champions; odium eventually agrees and attempts to name dalinar as his champion, though dalinar declines. shards outside of the rosharan system have also had champions. the heralds are similar to champions, and the conflicts between marsh and elend and between marsh and vin are an echo of this system. see also[edit] notes[edit]"
Adonalsium,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Adonalsium,"""“i have delved and searched, and have only been able to come up with a single name: adonalsium. who, or what, it was, i do not yet know. ”-the words of founding"" adonalsium, sometimes called just ado, is a mysterious being or force in the cosmere from which all investiture is derived. it is unknown whether the term adonalsium is a name or title. adonalsium is generally regarded as a god, responsible for the creation of the cosmere, and it is sometimes referred to as the ""power of creation."" in a pivotal moment in the history of the cosmere, an event known as the shattering, a group of individuals conspired against and killed adonalsium. upon its death the power was broken into sixteen shards which were all seized by some of the individuals present. these shards each bear an aspect of adonalsium's nature. nature[edit] the exact nature of adonalsium, whether it is more a force of nature or an intelligent being, is unknown, though either interpretation carries a measure of validity. notions that it could be ""killed"" or that it could ""design"" things suggests the latter, though these understandings could be faulty. it is unclear whether adonalsium's power reaches beyond the cosmere, or whether adonalsium could, unlike shards, wield its power to the fullest extent. adonalsium is widely believed to be the creator of the entire cosmere and all life within it. that is, excepting any subsequent creation performed by the shards, which is typically regarded as a copy of adonalsium's own designs performed with the remnants of its power. variations of the phrase ""power of creation"" typically refer to adonalsium or the remnants of its power, due to this belief. it is possible that the tendency of investiture to develop sentience over time is rooted in adonalsium's own drive to develop life. ""“anyway, there was a god. adonalsium. i don't know if it was a force or a being, though i suspect the latter.”-khriss' interpretation of adonalsium's nature"" all investiture in the cosmere is associated with adonalsium. consequently, all forms of magic are ultimately derived from adonalsium's power. as far as anyone in the cosmere is aware, there was no predecessor to adonalsium. while most of the more complex magic systems, such as allomancy and surgebinding, were established after the shattering, some simpler forms of magic, such as highstorms and spren, existed in some form prior to adonalsium's demise. furthermore, adonalsium exercised direct control over the nature and limitations of this magic. some ""fourth law"" of thermodynamics seems to govern adonalsium and the nature of investiture. it is unclear precisely why the power was later divided into sixteen shards, or why these shards bear the intents that they do. indeed, it is possible that a set of shards with an alternate set of natures may have been produced, and it may be possible for a different number to have been produced. in any case, the known shardic intents give some insight into adonalsium's nature, as each can generally be regarded as some primal force ascribed with a facet of adonalsium's own personality. it can be assumed, for example, that adonalsium had some sense of honor and a desire to cultivate, and that it maintained a balance between its concepts of ruin and preservation. with so many different, often conflicting, aspects to adonalsium's nature, it may have had difficulty taking certain actions or interfering with the cosmere in particular ways. adonalsium presumably possessed the divine abilities that are associated with the shards, including the ability to look into the future. history[edit] pre-shattering[edit] nobody knows whether adonalsium's investiture existed from eternity or whether it came into being--naturally, or by means of some other god. it is also unclear whether adonalsium's presumed consciousness existed alongside its power from the beginning, or whether it developed as a natural function of investiture. it is, however, likely that adonalsium existed before any other intelligent life in the cosmere. while the extent of adonalsium's role as a creator is unclear, it was at least directly responsible for the formation of some worlds, including roshar and the rest of the rosharan system. taldain's specific orbit may also lend itself to adonalsium's touch. ""“the worlds you now tread bear the touch and design of adonalsium.”-frost speaking of adonalsium"" nothing is known about any interaction adonalsium may have had with mortals, beyond its work as a creator. sapient beings were apparently aware of adonalsium's existence and power, at least, and some worshiped adonalsium as a deity. despite this, or perhaps because of it, some individuals grew to oppose adonalsium. their number included humans, dragons, and sho del, and their motives were diverse; while some sought power for themselves, others simply believed that adonalsium presented some manner of threat. and so, this opposing force developed a mysterious weapon for use against adonalsium. at least one plot to destroy adonalsium failed, though the details of this remain an enigma. it is possible that the weapon failed to accomplish the task it was designed for, and that the shattering was forced by some other means. on the other hand, it may be that the weapon was developed as an alternative approach after some prior strategy failed. though unlikely, given the thirst for power that motivated some conspirators, it is even possible that the shattering itself is the aforementioned failure--that the results of the shattering, whether caused by the weapon or otherwise, were not intended. shattering of adonalsium[edit] ""“a diverse group. with equally diverse motives. some wished for the power; others saw killing adonalsium as the only good option left to them. together they murdered a deity, and became divine themselves.”-khriss speaking of the shattering"" adonalsium's opposition, or some subset of their number, eventually put their final plan into action on yolen. the group included hoid and, likely, frost, in addition to those who would become the original vessels of the sixteen shards. few details are known concerning what transpired at the shattering. the shattering occurred as a single event at which adonalsium was indeed killed, and consequently its power was divided into sixteen equal portions. this bears some measure of resemblance to the splintering of shards. investiture throughout the cosmere was affected as a result of the shattering--becoming associated with particular shards. some evidence suggests that the participants influenced the quantity or nature of the shards which were left behind, but it may be that the result of the shattering was not entirely expected. it is clear that they did not fully have a plan as to how the power might be divided, as more than sixteen individuals were present and at least one of them, hoid, refused the offer of a shard. at least some of the participants in the shattering regret what occurred--particularly those who did not seize shards. this may be due to the direct consequences of the shattering, to the subsequent actions taken by the shards, or simply to guilt. the weapon intended to kill adonalsium no longer exists in its original form, having been expended, though remnants of it still exist in the physical realm and are the source of hoid's immortality. the shattering was accomplished through the use of the four dawnshards, a process which required both intent and command. legacy[edit] the shattering occurred roughly 10,000 years before the true desolation. in the centuries that followed, the shards settled on other worlds and began using their new power to shape the cosmere. new magic systems were developed, and manifestations of investiture which previously existed were changed in small ways. adonalsium's name was eventually forgotten in much of the cosmere, though worldhoppers remember at least some of its history and shalash appears to revere it still as divinity. ""“adonalsium... have you ever heard the term, dalinar?”-hoid questioning dalinar"" with access to future sight, adonalsium may have actually anticipated the shattering. while it apparently took no successful measures to prevent the attack, it may have laid certain plans in place which are still in effect. it is also possible that a cognitive shadow of adonalsium was left in its place following the shattering. scholars disagree as to whether adonalsium could be reformed by reuniting the sixteen shards of its power. though some theorize this may be possible, others argue that it would not restore that which was ""killed."" some think that uniting all sixteen shards would prove impossible, or that any being attempting to do so would be destroyed. regardless of the possibility, some believe that this should not be attempted for one reason or another. trivia[edit] - events on yolen, including the shattering of adonalsium, will be addressed in the - . - - is currently planned as a trilogy to be written after - is complete. - adonalsium is not a - . - developed the concept of adonalsium and the cosmere while writing - . - the name adonalsium is derived from a hebrew name for god, - (literally, ""my master""). - adonalsium is an anagram of ""a mind, a soul."" this may or may not be intentional. - while some might refer to adonalsium with he/him pronouns, this is not a canonization of what adonalsium actually is or how it should accurately be referred to. - in the original publication of - , adonalsium was misspelled as ""adonasium"". notes[edit]"

The Stormlight Archive,https://coppermind.net/wiki/The_Stormlight_Archive,"the stormlight archive is an ongoing epic fantasy series by brandon sanderson. set on the planet roshar, the series forms a core part of the cosmere sequence, and centers around odium's efforts to escape the ties that bind him to the rosharan system. the series is estimated to require ten books to complete. for a summary of the events thus far, see the individual summary pages for each book. structure[edit] the novels of the stormlight archive follow a consistent internal structure. each is split into five parts, and brandon plots each novel as if it were an entire trilogy. the names of each part, when put together, form a ketek. between each part is a set of interludes, set in different points of view, which show events in other locations on roshar. each novel has one character who gets multiple interludes, whose interludes effectively form a novella. the books also feature several pieces of in-world art on the endpages and between some chapters, and epigraphs from in-world documents at the start of each non-flashback chapter. each of the first five books begins with a prologue that shows a different character's perspective of the night of the assassination of gavilar and ends with an epilogue from hoid's point of view. each book also includes an ars arcanum. each novel will focus on one specific order of the knights radiant and feature flashbacks from a character tied to that order. brandon has made clear that a character can have flashback point of views, even if he or she is already dead, so the characters scheduled to have flashbacks in an upcoming book might still die before their book. the series will be split into two arcs of five books each, with a time gap of about ten years between the two arcs. the second arc will be written after mistborn era 3. brandon has said he also hopes to write novellas in between at least all the remaining arc one novels, though is unsure if he has enough time. these novellas would fill in some details and show parts of the story that wouldn't have otherwise been seen. subject to the assumption that characters stay associated with their current order and assigning the order of dustbringers to shalash's book by process of elimination, the following table summarizes these relationships and the order of books: brandon has also talked about wanting to go back and do a novella set between the way of kings and words of radiance; he initially thought this novella might focus on lopen, but, after including lopen in dawnshard, said it would likely be someone else, possibly teft. back cover text[edit] each book has a back cover text that is written in-universe from the perspective of one of the sleepless. keteks[edit] the titles of the five parts of each book form a ketek which is revealed with context in the endnote of every book. the abbreviations of the first five books also form a palindrome of five parts, being similar in structure to a ketek: (t)wok - wor - o - row - kow(t). cover galleries[edit] publication[edit] awards[edit] - way of kings #7 ny times best-seller - winner of the 2010 david gemmell legend award for best fantasy novel - the way of kings hit the times list in mass market, debuts at #25 on the chart - named one of the best of 2010 by fantasy faction - named one of the best of 2010 by ranting dragon - named one of the best of 2010 by sff world - named one of the best of 2010 by goodreads - words of radiance #1 ny times best-seller statistics[edit] the stormlight archive currently consists of four full novels and two novellas. trivia[edit] - when brandon initially wrote - , he called the series - . - by the time he pitched it to tor two years later, he had changed the series name to - . notes[edit]"
Mistborn (series),https://coppermind.net/wiki/Mistborn_(series),"mistborn is a fantasy series by brandon sanderson. it is a major part of the cosmere sequence and is set mostly on the planet scadrial. it is most well known as the trilogy of mistborn: the final empire, the well of ascension and the hero of ages, but there have been additional installments. brandon originally planned a ""trilogy of trilogies"" but this has been expanded into a number of series over various eras in the history of scadrial. era 1: original trilogy[edit] the first mistborn trilogy chronicles the efforts of a secret group of allomancers who attempt to overthrow a dystopian empire and establish themselves in a world covered by ash. era 2: wax and wayne series[edit] set about 300 years after era 1, the wax and wayne series is about the exploits of waxillium ladrian, a ""wild-west deputy"" forced to move into the big city who starts investigating kidnappings and robberies. the alloy of law was initially conceived as one of several short stories brandon wanted to set between the first and second main trilogies that eventually grew into a full novel, and then a series. the wax and wayne series is a single four book series; the alloy of law stands more-or-less alone while the rest are plotted together like a trilogy. brandon has also said that he may do some more stories before the second trilogy, set in a 1940's society. era 3: ghostbloods trilogy[edit] mistborn: ghostbloods, the third trilogy, will be set in the early computer age with 1980s technology. the main character is planned as a terris woman who is a computer programmer and nicroburst; her brother is also planned to be a character. peter has described her as a ""brown terris geek girl"", though he does point out that this could change by the time the series is actually being written. brandon backs up this description, and describes it as a sort of ""how nerd culture works on scadrial."" brandon had initially planned for the trilogy to feature an allomancer swat team, with a team of allomancers hired to take out a serial killer, but is now leaning more towards a spy thriller. it will probably be released in the 2020s, after stormlight 5 and the elantris sequels. he will be writing it in a similar manner to the first trilogy, writing all three books before publishing so that he could properly foreshadow and edit past books. he is greatly looking forward to writing book ten. these will be returning to the length of the mistborn era one books. it is planned for these books to include a global map of scadrial. there are short comic books that are planned to be interspersed in them, similar to the broadsheets in era two. there are going to be allomancy-involved sports, and various characters are planned to be twinborn with ""really neat combinations."" it is planned to take place fifty to seventy years after era two, by which time the southern scadrians will be well-known to the rest of scadrial. it will put more focus upon kelsier and trell. melaan is also expected to play a role. possible cyberpunk mistborn trilogy[edit] brandon has interest in writing a ""cyberpunk"" mistborn trilogy between eras three and four. whether he writes it depends on how era three plays out and if he feels he has enough time to write more books before he gets too old. the books would be similar in length to era two (around 100,000 words) and be written around the same time as the second half of the stormlight archive. this trilogy would become era four and push space age mistborn to era five and put mistborn up to a fitting sixteen books. if a whole trilogy isn’t feasible he wants to at least write a novella. nothing about the characters or plot are known but brandon wants to play with unsealed metalminds as cyberpunk-esque “metallurgic wetware”. era 4: fourth mistborn trilogy[edit] the fourth trilogy is going to be a space-opera with allomancy-powered faster-than-light technology. hoid will be a main character in this trilogy. the sleepless, or dysian aimians, will also have a major role in this trilogy. the iriali are also planned to have a major role. there may be two more currently untitled cosmere series written before this trilogy. he plans for each era 4 book to be around the length of a stormlight book. other media[edit] - - tabletop rpg by - - cancelled video game - - various incarnations of a movie deal - - board game by cover galleries[edit] publication[edit] awards[edit] - the hero of ages - #21 on ny times hardcover list - the well of ascension - finalist for romantic times award, best epic fantasy - the hero of ages - winner of the romantic times award, best epic fantasy - the hero of ages - finalist for the inaugural david gemmell award - all three mistborn trilogy books are sf book club selections - the hero of ages - selected as an indie next list notable for dec. 2008 notes[edit]"

Dragonsteel (series),https://coppermind.net/wiki/Dragonsteel_(series),"dragonsteel refers to an unpublished series set on yolen that has been called the prequel to the cosmere. it takes place first chronologically and will feature the shattering, hoid's backstory, and dragons. one reason brandon has not prioritized this series, though, is that he doesn't want readers to feel that they have to read his other books in order to understand what is happening, and he probably won't publish hoid's story until it becomes relevant. he plans to rewrite and publish dragonsteel at some point after the full arc of the stormlight archive has been completed. about[edit] ""“dragonsteel is an unpublished series set on the shardworld yolen. the first two books form a duology, with hoid as a major character. they are preliminarily titled ""the liar of partinel"" and ""the lightweaver of rens"". the first one, and perhaps the second one as well are set before the shattering of adonalsium. brandon will not show anyone these books, and i don't think he's even written them both. there are five more books that occur hundreds of years later, so not ""directly"" a series, but still the same world. these five are the core dragonsteel sequence, the first of which brandon wrote for his master's thesis at byu. it is still in the library there. many things have changed since then, so this book is no longer canon. ”-user: windrunner on dragonsteel and related stories."" development[edit] brandon began work on the dragonsteel series with dragonsteel prime, which was written as part of brandon sanderson's masters thesis and has provided source material for some of his later work, particularly the way of kings. brandon regularly reminds readers that he wrote this version of the story when he was a much younger author and that it isn't his best work. after positive response to his release of the way of kings prime, he has discussed a possible release of this draft as part of a ""sanderson curiosities"" series. in 2007, brandon attempted to rewrite the series for publishing, this time beginning with prequels the liar of partinel and the lightweaver of rens. taking place five hundred years before the events of dragonsteel prime, they were intended to explore the setting and hoid's backstory in greater detail and borrowed the magic system from another unpublished work, aether of night. at this point, brandon's plan was to release a total of seven dragonsteel books, including the two prequels and a five-book main story arc beginning with the eternal war, which would be a rewrite of dragonsteel prime. brandon wrote all of the liar of partinel and had outlined the lightweaver of rens, but was unsatisfied with the result and decided to put the series on hold while he worked on finishing robert jordan's the wheel of time series. he then shifted his focus to revisiting the way of kings instead, which he went on to publish in 2010, and dragonsteel was rescheduled to be written after the stormlight series. of this attempt, brandon has said that ""every chapter was a chore to write."" he also felt that the characters did not quite work and does not share this book with fans because it will give them a wrong impression of certain characters. in his 2019 state of the sanderson post, brandon published an updated outline of the cosmere in which dragonsteel was reduced from seven books to three. by this point, significant parts of the original dragonsteel story arc had been used elsewhere, and so the series was envisioned as a tighter story about hoid's origins and the shattering. a rewritten dragonsteel series is still not planned for release until after book 10 of the stormlight archive. it is currently planned to be written in first-person. it is the only series in the cosmere planned to be done in first-person. two of the 2023-released 'secret project' novels, tress of the emerald sea and yumi and the nightmare painter, were written in hoid's voice partly as practice for telling this series in that fashion. notes[edit]"

Kelsier,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kelsier,"""“there's always another secret. ”-kelsier's mantra"" kelsier is a half-skaa mistborn from scadrial. he is stern and intense, but always smiling; another act of rebellion against the lord ruler's oppression. he hates injustice and takes this hatred to the extreme, which originally resulted in him being unable to see good in any of the nobility. this was changed by vin who fell in love with elend venture. kelsier went on to save elend's life from an inquisitor. his late wife mare collected pre-ascension memorabilia, and he keeps one piece, a drawing of a flower, to inspire his crew. kelsier is the younger brother of marsh, who is disappointed at kelsier's apparent lack of direction or purpose until kelsier leads the skaa rebellion. he always keeps a smile on his face, because that is the one thing the lord ruler can't take from him. appearance and personality[edit] ""“they called you their god, and you were casual with their faith! the hearts of men are not your toys. ”-preservation to kelsier"" kelsier is tall and hawk-faced and has light-blonde hair and hazel eyes; he has a multitude of scars crossing both arms from his time in the pits of hathsin. he usually wears a nobleman's suit (a colored vest with dark trousers and a coat), and during the night he wears his mistcloak. he is almost always late to gatherings, which he attributes to always having somewhere better to be. he always smiles and projects an excited and positive attitude, which is particularly unusual in the skaa underground. he does this in order to fight the lord ruler's oppression of all the skaa, wanting to have one thing which cannot be taken away from him. he hates all of the nobility and tends to believe that all of them are to blame for the plight of the skaa, although near the end of his life this attitude changes due to vin's insistence that elend is different and that not all the nobles should be fought, although his views did not fully change, and he retained his prejudice and distrust. he has an imposing presence and is a natural leader, easily taking charge and swaying even the downtrodden skaa of luthadel into joining the rebellion with his charming personality. if kelsier orders a person around, it is a sign of affection. kelsier is a psychopath, or at least has some psychopathic tendencies. he shows little empathy or fear, as well as a high ego, and is frequently quick to resort to using violence-often lethal violence-to solve problems, even when doing so clearly won't actually help the people he is supposedly trying to help. he is arrogant and very driven which, combined with his power, makes him incredibly dangerous; he is willing to go extremely far to achieve his goals-for example, he would be willing to use hemalurgy on a large scale to create powerful allomancers if ultimately necessary to protect scadrial from other forces in the cosmere-though is not quite as utilitarian as taravangian. perhaps as a result of his egotism and arrogance, several of his plans involve setting himself up as a powerful, mysterious, or even divine figure. he is a great agent of chaos and is very good at tearing things down and messing with what other people want. there is a darkness to him that other heroes, such as kaladin, would fight but that kelsier instead embraces and is so ruthless that, in a fight with other notable people from the cosmere, he would be the most likely to win; even hoid considers him incredibly dangerous. had his life gone differently, he could have been an outright evil person and, outside the context of the final empire, would likely be a villain. attributes and abilities[edit] allomancy[edit] kelsier is a mistborn, so he can burn every allomantic metal, although he is particularly proficient with the external physical metals iron and steel. he is capable of using them with a high degree of precision to control the momentum and rotation of dozens of pieces of metal simultaneously. he once used them in his fight with a steel inquisitor, so the metals acted like they were alive, twitching and flying through the air to cut and distract the steel inquisitor. he lacks finesse in the external mental abilities of zinc and brass as he tends to create large changes in emotional states as opposed to the more subtle soothing abilities of breeze, although he can affect a relatively large mass of people. he is quite proficient at pewter dragging and has enough practice to maintain it for hours and still maintain a fair amount of clarity afterwards. he lost these abilities in death and has not recovered them. sliver[edit] after kelsier died, he became a cognitive shadow through the well of ascension, making him able to resist the pull of the beyond. after holding and releasing the shard of preservation, kelsier became a sliver. preservation[edit] kelsier held preservation for a short time but was bad at using it because he was a cognitive shadow at the time and did not match well with preservation's intent. hemalurgy[edit] kelsier has a hemalurgic spike in his right eye socket, which he acquires sometime after the catacendre. as a result, he has both regular vision and the steelsight that inquisitors used, allowing him to see via both normal light and trace metals. this spike pins his soul to his bones. devotion[edit] kelsier has an unknown seon which he uses to commmunicate with his ghostbloods on scadrial. history[edit] early life[edit] born to a noble father and skaa mother, his mother kept both kelsier and marsh alive by pretending that she was noble to their father so that their children would be considered merely illegitimate noblemen instead of half-breeds; however, their father eventually found out. thus kelsier's mother was killed, and because of this, the brothers have a deep hatred of noblemen. kelsier then made his living as a thief, becoming famous throughout luthadel. he teamed up with the escaped plantation skaa dockson and the tineye mare, whom he married. they were extremely successful. kelsier later said that ""he had more money than he could spend"" however, after a failed attempt at stealing from the lord ruler in his secret room inside kredik shaw, he was sent to the atium mines in the pits of hathsin. there he spent his time believing that his wife mare had betrayed him to the lord ruler until he witnessed his wife being beaten to death by guards after she gifted her atium bead to him. he then ""snapped"", becoming a mistborn. using allomancy he was able to escape the pits. kelsier was then trained by a mistborn named gemmel and they traveled to the far north of the western dominance to a city called mantiz where kelsier fought and killed the mistborn antillius shezler. from the skaa in keep shezler he heard rumors of the eleventh metal. kelsier sought and eventually found the eleventh metal as he believed it would help him to defeat the lord ruler. recruiting his crew[edit] ""“ah, but being an annoyance is something that i am very good at. in fact, i’m far more than just a mild annoyance. people tell me i can be downright frustrating! might as well use that talent for the cause of good eh? ”-kelsier to marsh"" after discovering the eleventh metal kelsier started to prepare his plan by hiring the kandra oreseur. then he killed the noble lord renoux and let oreseur impersonate him. he met with yeden the leader of the skaa rebellion and made yeden hire him to bring down the final empire. on kelsier's way back to luthadel, he made a stop at the farm of lord themos tresting to talk with the farm skaa. when lord tresting attempted to rape a skaa girl, kelsier saved her, killing tresting and all his servants and soldiers in the process. he burned down the manor and purposely departed in a way that forced the skaa to join the rebellion. when he arrived in luthadel, he first reunited with his old partner and best friend dockson. dockson told kelsier about a young allomancer girl marsh had discovered whom he suspected was a mistborn. kelsier and dockson went to see her first hand; they watched vin soothe an obligator during camon's scheme, confirming that she was at least a soother. after camon and vin left, kelsier realized that the ministry had already discovered that camon was a thief and only played along to find the crew's hideout. a steel inquisitor had been present, discovering vin's allomancy. the inquisitor and some soliders followed camon to find his hideout to wipe out his crew, but kelsier lured the inquisitor away by using his own allomancy while dockson took out the soldiers. they went to the hideout themselves just in time to save vin from camon. kelsier knocked out camon with steelpushes and gave control over the crew to milev. he forced the rest of the crew to leave, only leaving vin. kelsier's suspicions that vin was a mistborn were confirmed when he saw that she was able to burn zinc. kelsier offered to let her to join his crew. vin didn't trust him but agreed in order to learn how to use allomancy. later, kelsier invited a team of the best thieves in the city to a gathering in camon's safe house. he introduced them and vin to yeden and explained his plan to destroy the final empire and kill the lord ruler. breeze, ham, clubs, and clubs' nephew spook joined his crew. while initially hostile, in the end kelsier's brother marsh joined, and together the crew developed a plan to defeat the final empire. the plan was to secretly build up an army of twenty thousand trained skaa soldiers in the arguois caverns while at the same time causing confusion and distrust in the nobility to cause a house war. once their army was trained and the houses grew unstable enough, they would send a part of their army to attack the pits of hathsin, forcing the garrison of luthadel to go and defend the pits. with the garrison gone and the nobility weakened by the war, the rest of the army then could take over luthadel. then yeden would gain control of the city and the crew would receive the lord ruler's atium stash as payment. breeze would recruit men for the rebellion, ham would train them in the arguois caverns, dockson would direct the operation's finances, clubs would hide the group's allomancy with copperclouds, oreseur in the role of lord renoux would buy the necessary equipment, marsh would infiltrate the steel ministry posing as an obligator, kelsier would use his mistborn power to make attacks on the nobility to create tension between the houses, and vin would gather information in the noble court posing as renoux's niece valette. kelsier also wanted to try kill the lord ruler with the eleventh metal as a ""voluntary bonus"".[citation needed] the skaa rebellion[edit] to put the plan in motion, kelsier first targeted keep venture, as house venture was currently the most powerful house in luthadel and an attack on it would have the greatest impact. kelsier killed eight hazekillers, stole a bag of atium, and made sure that it became known that a mistborn had attacked a great house, something forbidden by an unspoken agreement between the houses. he gifted vin a mistcloak and started to teach her allomancy. vin expected that kelsier would use his knowledge to control her, but to her surprise, he openly explained her the eight basic metals. kelsier let vin jump over the city walls as an exercise for steel and iron and was surprised how voluntarily she did it, remembering his own training. outside the city, they saw a mistwraith. back at the city gates kelsier introduced vin to sazed. realizing vin didn't trust him, he told her that in his crew they trust each other. he offered to teach her about gold and atium, gave her the money he took from camon, and allowed her to leave, as he didn't want to force anybody into his crew. vin decided to stay in order to see if he told the truth about trusting others. in the following months, kelsier himself took on many roles to further the plan, acting as a beacon to the repressed skaa, assisting in recruitment, attacking many noblemen to increase the tensions between the great houses,, collecting information by purchasing it from informants, and even posing as an informant in order to provide misinformation to noblemen. he continued training vin and was surprised by her quick progress. though they suffered many setbacks, kelsier's leadership allowed the rebellion to attain an army of sufficient size to hold luthadel. death[edit] ""“but you can't kill me, lord tyrant. i represent that one thing you've never been able to kill, no matter how hard you try. i am hope. ”-kelsier to the lord ruler, last words before death"" when several skaa from the rebellion were about to be executed, kelsier attempts to save them. he is confronted by a steel inquisitor, which he eventually manages to defeat by beheading him with the inquisitor's own obsidian axe. however, kelsier is then confronted by the lord ruler, who backhands him across the face and then stabs him in the chest with a spear, killing him. kelsier later reveals in his letter to vin that he had intended to use the eleventh metal to destroy the lord ruler but could not discover how to use it in his fight. after his death, oreseur takes his bones and appears before several groups of skaa, making them believe that kelsier survived somehow. this results in the skaa considering him a god, leading to the founding of the church of the survivor, which refers to kelsier as ""lord of the mists"". vin also became a major religious figure in the wake of his death, as the survivorists consider her kelsier's heir. tensoon learned the location of his bones from oreseur, and used them to convince the people of luthadel to hide in the caverns after king penrod was corrupted by ruin. time in the cognitive realm[edit] immediately after his death, kelsier arrived in the cognitive realm and met preservation. he then asked preservation if they are god, and after being told yes he promptly punched preservation in the face. then he found the power at the well of ascension and became trapped there with ruin, though merging with the power of the well allowed him to become a cognitive shadow and resist the pull of the beyond. while he was in the well, hoid passed by and kelsier essentially challenges him to a fight that kelsier ultimately loses. he feels ruin's presence during his time in the well. once he is freed from the well along with ruin, he initially travels around through the cognitive version of luthadel, seeking out his friends. he finds vin and ham near the steps of keep venture and also learned that dockson had died in the battle of luthadel. he walks past luthadel towards the lake of the same name, near which he finds khriss and nazh. they question him on preservation's appearance after learning he has spoken directly with the shard, and then continue their discussion onto other topics. khriss mentions the ire which sets kelsier onto his next quest of finding their base of operation. during his journey to find the ire, he runs into ruin and has a discussion about ruin's intent. after that, he left the area of the cognitive realm surrounding scadrial and moved closer to finding the ire. when he reaches their base, he moved past their guards and passed the wall into their chambers. he ultimately only took a glass orb from them after thwarting their plan to take over become the vessel of preservation after leras' death. when he returned to scadrial he found that preservation's power was significantly weakened. he also ran into vin and was shocked to see how far she had come in the time he was away. he stayed with her for a while after that but ultimately had to leave. ""“from the well of ascension, of course. it's the same power, after all. solid in the metal you fed to elend. the liquid in the pool you burned. and vapor in the air, confined to night. hiding you. protecting you.giving you power!”-kelsier speaks to vin before she ascends."" when leras died and ruin began to splinter the shard of preservation, kelsier used the ire's orb to connect with preservation and ascend, allowing him to protect the power and hold it until vin could take it. despite preservation not usually being able to speak into the minds of other, due to some combination of spook being near death, having a broken soul, and believing kelsier was a god, he was able to talk to spook. he used this opportunity to tell spook to send a message to vin, warning her that any spiked person could potentially be under ruin's control. secretly, however, he knew that ruin would send marsh to intercept the message, and was hoping that reading the message would give marsh the information he needed to remove vin's earring, which was also a hemalurgic spike that was keeping her from taking up preservation's power. when marsh caught vin in luthadel, he attacked ruin with preservation's power, weakening ruin's control over marsh just enough for marsh to rip out vin's earring. with the spike removed, kelsier encouraged her to take up the power, relinquishing it so that she can do so. after she and elend are killed, kelsier spoke with them before they moved on to the beyond. after sazed's ascension and spook's rise to political power, kelsier began to speak with spook about finding a way to bring himself back to the physical realm. as a cognitive shadow tied to scadrial, it is difficult for him to travel to other planets via shadesmar. he does not yet know the secret to overcome this limitation. his bones survived the ascension of harmony, and may have helped him regain physical form. continued worship post-catacendre[edit] many years after the catacendre, the cult which started after kelsier's deception with oreseur directly following his death has become a fully-formed religion. the church of the survivor, or survivorism, is possibly the most organized of scadrial's religions in this period, as well as being the clear favorite among the social elite and downtrodden alike. steris and marasi are both members of this religion, though marasi admits that it is more because she was raised in it. its central tenet is simply to survive, by any means, until you cannot survive any longer. priests in this religion wear robes with stitching up the arms to emulate kelsier's scars from the pits of hathsin. the ""survivor's statemark"" is one of the symbols of the faith. when bleeder killed father bin by nailing him to a wall, it is described as a parody of the survivor's statemark, implying that the statemark depicts the way kelsier died, impaled by a spear. aside from the survivorists, there was also a whole civilization of people that worshiped kelsier far to to the south of elendel, calling him the sovereign. kelsier had traveled there several years after the catacendre, inhabiting a physical body that was spiked in the right eye, and found the southern scadrians slowly dying of an unexplained coldness. he helped the people there survive using his knowledge of the metallic arts, showing them how to make unsealed metalminds to store attributes like heat in a way that could be shared with anyone. as the sovereign, kelsier ruled the southern scadrians for a time and formed another religion that deified metalborn, and then he left. before leaving them, he created the bands of mourning, a collection of unsealed metalminds forged together and containing all kinds of attributes in extremely large quantities. he hid the artifact away somewhere in the north and then disappeared. cosmere-wide activity[edit] kelsier is known as thaidakar to the ghostbloods, a secret society that operates on several planets, including roshar. kelsier is the leader and presumed founder of the organization, which mraize calls ""the most powerful organization in all the cosmere."" he is referred to by hoid as ""the lord of scars."" kelsier is iyatil's master. while he is incapable of leaving scadrial in person, he uses an ""avatar"" to visit the ghostbloods on roshar. he appears to be using the ghostbloods to find a way for him to leave scadrial and is very interested in learning from the heralds, particularly kalak, as they are subject to a similar restriction. when assassinated by szeth, gavilar suspects thaidakar of ordering his death. he has also worked together with khriss. the ghostbloods believe kelsier to still have his allomantic abilities, and he appears to be playing into this lie. kelsier and wax[edit] waxillium ladrian was a direct descendant of a close associate of kelsier, edgard ladrian. as a pathian, wax did not worship kelsier, but his life has nonetheless been drastically affected by the survivor. marsh decided to give wax a book explaining hemalurgy because he believed wax was doing kelsier's work. this book proved vital in solving the case of bleeder. while conversing with harmony regarding the case, harmony said that wax's casual way of talking to him reminded him of kelsier. harmony also made vague allusions to the southern scadrians that kelsier once ruled as the sovereign. later on, a group of southern scadrians traveled north in search of the sovereign's bands of mourning, but were captured by the set, who decided to seek the bands as well. wax and his friends became embroiled in this incident in opposition to the set, and wax was almost killed in an encounter with them. after marasi solved the riddle of the bands and wielded it to escape the set, she gave it to wax, who wielded it and became incredibly powerful. wax then used the artifact to defeat the set and save the southern scadrian prisoners, using up a lot of the investiture stored in the bands. soon afterwards, wax accessed a coppermind contained in a coin-like southern scadrian medallion that hoid had given him and saw a vision of what appeared to be kelsier's memory of discovering the southern scadrians hundreds of years prior. the vision, seen from kelsier's point of view, showed that his spiked right eye viewed the world through allomantic lines, similar to steel inquisitors, while his left eye saw things normally. relationships[edit] marsh[edit] ""“no, kelsier was not fond of marsh. but strangely, he still loved him. ”-kelsier"" marsh is kelsier’s older brother. the two of them have a strained relationship. marsh resents kelsier because kelsier had success with the skaa rebellion soon after marsh quit being its leader. marsh doesn’t like a lot of kelsier’s actions and the way he handles the rebellion. he strongly disapproves of the way kelsier flippantly kills noblemen and those who serve them without a second thought. despite his disapproval of kelsier’s actions, marsh is still willing to infiltrate the steel ministry as part of kelsier’s plan. despite their strained relationship, kelsier is still grieved and angry when they find evidence of marsh’s death. marsh is aware of kelsier’s current activities as a cognitive shadow. vin[edit] ""“i don't want to be responsible for something happening to you, vin. not again. ”-kelsier"" kelsier is vin’s mentor and teaches her to use her allomantic abilities. though vin initially is wary and suspicious of him, she eventually learns to trust him, and he becomes somewhat of a father figure to her. he tries to teach vin to smile and occasionally look on the bright side of things. they go on several outings together, including fighting inquisitors this leads to vin almost dying however and changes how kelsier runs the crew. though he is killed by the lord ruler, he watches over vin as a cognitive shadow. he feels guilty for abandoning her but does his best to help her. he eventually plays an important role in freeing her from ruin’s influence. gemmel[edit] gemmel is kelsier's mentor in the allomantic arts, meeting each other after kelsier escaped from his captivity in hathsin. gemmel frequently put kelsier into life and death situations in order to push him to learn how to use his powers. seeing his powers, gemmel wondered what he unleashed upon the world in teaching kelsier allomancy. hoid[edit] ""“ deal with your own stupid planet, you idiot. don't make me come over there and slap you around again. ”- hoid to kelsier through shallan"" he and hoid have a very antagonistic relationship one with one another, stretching back to when they first met and got into a violent fight. merely interacting with hoid for a brief amount of time was enough to send kelsier into a murderous rage. hoid greatly disapproves of kelsier's interference with roshar through the ghostbloods. he considers him to be very dangerous. hoid has also taken direct action against him, giving wax an unsealed coppermind containing knowledge that he would rather keep hidden. at the time of meeting, he saw kelsier as a wild card that he didn't want to deal with. gavilar[edit] he and gavilar were working against each other to an unknown extent. their relationship was the sort to where gavilar was quick to believe that he was the one who ordered his murder. ati[edit] ""“you can say what you wish, but you don't own me. i am not yours. ”-kelsier"" kelsier is terrified by ati and the power that he holds, seeing and feeling it through the well of ascension. ati manipulated kelsier for many years, grooming him in order to bring about his release. when kelsier was in the cognitive realm after his release, he often would show up to him in order to mock him and his inability to do anything. leras[edit] ""“they called you their god, and you were casual with their faith! the hearts of men are not your toys. ”-leras to kelsier"" kelsier at first hated leras for claiming to be god, enough to instantly punch him. for a period, he did not fully respect or believe leras's divinity, but over time he came to respect him more. he nicknamed him fuzz, due to his unraveled appearance. leras is fascinated by kelsier due to him being the first to punch him after death, and being the first to attempt to recruit him to their schemes. thus he decides to go along with him out of curiosity. despite being mostly cordial with kelsier, he does disapprove of him to an extent due to how he manipulated peoples faiths during his life, playing with their hearts and treating their faith casually. he also is frustrated how much kelsier goes against his intent, bringing about massive societal change in how he brought about the death of the lord ruler, who was perfectly preserved, and played into ruin's plans. quotes[edit] trivia[edit] - kelsier was released by - as a character skin in the game - on may 27, 2021. the playable character does not have mistborn powers. - kelsier and - do not get along. - if given the chance, kelsier would find it ""really fun"" to punch - next. - kelsier would understand, but still disapprove of, - plans. - he is

has told the ghostbloods, kelsier does not have a real avatar. uncanonically, brandon imagines kelsier as using a seon in a trench coat as his 'avatar'. - kelsier considers guns to be inelegant weapons. - if he were a radiant, there are three orders kelsier might belong to: edgedancer, dustbringer, or willshaper. the reason he would fit well as an edgedancer is mainly because of what he picked up from mare regarding restoring the world to the time of flowers and greenery. dustbringer also fits because of the theme of self mastery and pushing himself. willshaper is high on the list as well. - if he were a returned, his name would likely be lifeseeker, or something along those lines. notes[edit]"
Khrissalla,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Khrissalla,"duchess khrissalla, better known as khriss, is a female worldhopper originally from the country of elis on the darkside of taldain. appearance and personality[edit] khriss has brown skin, being from the darkside of taldain. she has brown eyes and wears her hair in braids. while on dayside, khriss wears a pair of dark, heavy sunglasses as she is not used to the sunlight of dayside. she also wears a wide-brimmed hat to keep the sun's rays from her face. khriss is a university-educated scholar and is extremely inquisitive. she seeks to understand and find scientific explanations for all that she can. she believes in freedom of information, and is willing to assist any who come to her for help if she perceives their intentions to be good. attributes and abilities[edit] khriss is one of the most accomplished scholars of magic in the cosmere. she knows more about the cosmere and its magic systems than nazh, her assistant, and hoid, who has been alive since before the shattering. she collects her knowledge in the ars arcana. the most important question she wants answered is what happens in the beyond, followed by how to get stormlight off roshar. khriss has starmarks. history[edit] taldain[edit] khriss was engaged for a time to gevalden--or gevin, as he preferred in informal settings--a prince of elis. before their wedding, gevalden traveled to dayside in search of the mythical sand mages, where he was shot by dynasty assassins. his linguist and assistant, wilheln, wrote to khriss to report on his death. khriss, determined to seek out what her fiancé was trying to discover, traveled to dayside with baon, allstren cynder, and jon acron and some elisian soldiers. they arrived in the kerztian port of dosha-har'ken, on the northwest coast of dayside, and purchased supplies from a merchant that spoke dynastic, who also offered the services of his nephew daazk as a guide to lossand. she met kenton shortly after the kerztian attack on the sand masters, and he agreed to be her guide to lossand's capital, kezare, where they parted ways. in the darksider district of lonzare khriss met with loaten and attempted to get answers about gevin's attempt to contact the sand mages, but their meeting was inturrpted by nilto. she then sought the taisha, assuming gevin would have met with them, but failed to get meetings with any of the taishin before finally discovering kenton was the lord mastrell. after recovering from her initial anger at his deception, khriss decided to help kenton in his mission to preserve the diem. she reasoned that the diem's sand masters could not support elis if they were disbanded, and used her diplomatic skill to help kenton negotiate with the lord artisan. using a letter of introduction from the diem, khriss was also able to meet with lady judge heelis who suggested she speak to the lord beggar nilto to help sway public opinion for the diem. during their meeting, nilto gives her prince gevalden's signet ring and pistol, but refuses to explain how he acquired the items. because kenton witheld many details of sand mastery, khriss attempted to research white sand and the mechanics of sand mastery based on observation. khriss eventually discovered that it was baon that killed captain deral and his lieutenant, and that he was sent to elis by the dynasty. following baon's departure, khriss decided to move to the diem so that she could try to learn sand mastery; but was ultimately unable to display any potential in the sand mastery test. trying to find baon before he left the city, she asked n'teese to arrange a meeting with nilto for her, to ask if he knew baon's whereabouts. during this meeting nilto called her ""khriss"", causing her to realize his identity as gevin. she confronted him at the kezare docks as he was attempting to leave the city when professor acron revealed himself as an assassin sent by the dynasty to kill gevalden. acron shot baon when he interferred to allow gevin and khriss to escape. while running from acron, khriss used a crane to knock him into the harbor. she asked gevin to return with her to darkside, but he refused in favor of continuing to help people on dayside. baon returned to her service as bodyguard since there was no conflict with his mission for the dynasty. when the lord merchant vey disappeared, she pressured gevin into using his contacts as nilto to discover where he had gone if he wanted her to keep silent about his survival. she then traveled with kenton to lraezare to find the lord merchant, and they returned to kezare once kenton made his deal with him. searching for the lord general, khriss was present when they discovered his body in the the tower's wine cellar. khriss was present at the diem when kenton dueled drile, and baon prevented her from interferring. after the diem was restored, khriss returned to darkside with multiple barrels of white sand and a few sand masters to aid her experiments in making sand mastery work on darkside. silverlight[edit] at some point khriss was involved in the founding of a university in silverlight. scadrial[edit] ""“you've stumbled into something far, far bigger than you, your politics, or your little planet.”-khriss to kelsier"" khriss and nazh were discovered by kelsier in the cognitive realm of scadrial in 1023 fe. the pair enlightened kelsier on how the events on scadrial were affecting the cosmere. they remained quite vague as to why they were there - although khriss mentioned wanting to see what the death of a shard looks like - or about other events elsewhere in the cosmere that were unrelated to the current conflict. khriss refused his requests for help and they left abruptly after kelsier told them of his meeting with drifter. since then, she has worked with kelsier on research at least once. over three centuries later, she appeared at a party in new seran in post-catacendre scadrial, 342 pc. there she stole a dance with waxillium ladrian and asked him questions about his powers and how they related to physics. she was also mentioned in a broadsheet ad, telling people who hear talking tools to contact khriss and nazh. relationships[edit] nazh[edit] the mapmaker nazh is in her employ. she commonly sends him out to procure maps, documents and other illustrations for her, particularly in high-risk environments. although the two argue fairly often, they are good friends and nazh is fiercely loyal to her. gevalden[edit] before she left darkside for the first time, she was engaged to prince gevalden of elis. they appear to have been quite close, enough so that khriss organized an expedition to fulfill his mission of finding the sand mages after his reported death on dayside. after discovering his identity as nilto, she asks him to return to darkside with her. he refuses, saying he will not return after being injured, and that he and khriss have both changed too much to have a relationship. trivia[edit] - she would be mistaken for being a - on - , - and as a terriswoman on scadrial. notes[edit]"
Resonance,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Resonance,"""“the effects here are more subtle than they are when mixing surges on roshar, but i am convinced that each unique combination also creates something distinctive. not just two powers, you could say, but two powers … and an effect. this demands further study. ”-khriss."" resonances are additional powers or effects gained by people with access to more than one invested art or surge. mechanics[edit] resonances arise from the nature of how shards combine. they are not simply a combination of the two base powers, but rather a separate, more distinctive, effect. the combination of powers can also cause slight variances in how the base powers are manifested, which is why knights radiant of different orders may manifest their shared surges slightly differently. the longer a person uses their two powers, the more likely they are to acquire a resonance. an individual with many powers, such as a mistborn or full feruchemist, may lose this added effect. with so many powers, the individual powers effectively wash out any resonance. it is still possible for such people to have a resonance, but it would be much less pronounced. temporarily gaining additional powers, such as from the bands of mourning, would not deprive someone of a resonance they previously had. someone with one power who began using the bands of mourning might develop a resonance between their original power and the bands. it is possible for a surgebinder with multiple honorblades/nahel bonds to develop a resonance or resonances between the four surges. known resonances[edit] surgebinding[edit] all orders of knights radiant have access to two surges, and therefore each order has a resonance of their own. if a radiant were to gain access to other surges, either through an honorblade or bonding to a different spren, resonances can form from surges that wouldn't normally interact. known surgebinding resonances include: - resonance is an increased number of squires, more than any other order. - resonance is increased mnemonic ability. - for - , this manifests as the ability to take a ""memory"" of a scene, which she can recall at a later time with perfect accuracy; when she put it to paper as a painting or a sketch the memory is completely removed from her mind. - this is similar to the way an - stores memories in their copperminds. there is a limit to how many memories she can store at the same time. - memories are tied to - - . - lightweavers can experience light and color differently and may be able to minutely alter the mood of others. - it is also implied that they may be able to create a solid illusion by combining their illumination surge and their soulcasting. metallic arts[edit] twinborn, individuals who are both ferrings and mistings, also have resonances. hemalurgy will usually not create resonances, but it is possible for it to happen. potential resonances[edit] - resonance is unknown, though it does not involve telling guilty and innocent people apart. - resonance may be the ability to communicate especially well, - as scholars considered the pre- - edgedancers ""the most articulate and refined"" of the radiants, - and - is easily able to speak and understand quite opaque street slang in - . - resonance may be an internal gps, due to jasnah being able to pinpoint the closest settlement after returning from shadesmar without any equipment. - elsecallers' ability to - at a distance is not a resonance, as it is something that lightweavers could learn as well. trivia[edit] - the nature of resonances was partially inspired by the - of waves. - ability to create a "" - "" to deflect metal moving around him - was originally intended to be the result of him being a - in the resonance between his - and - . brandon later indicated that may not still be accurate, as he realized wax was not manifesting the usual consequences of savantism. notes[edit]"

the vote for king."" in his early life, elend was an idealist. he was curious about the conditions of the skaa and their intelligence and believed in creating a coalition of houses to exert pressure on the lord ruler. however, he struggled to be forceful and to impose his will in others. he saw himself as a friendly and a comfortable man, but also a bit of a fool. he considered running an empire mostly as an academic exercise. however, he had a buried desire to lead, and the skills to become a king, if he learned to use them. after tindwyl's coaching, elend became more forceful and realistic. he still wants to follow his ideals of freedom, but he also knows sometimes he must impose his rule on others, for their own good. he tries to find a balance between the man he thinks he should be and the man he needs to be, but he considers himself a hypocrite for speaking of democracy, but taking the throne by force. even after becoming emperor, he considers himself a scholar rather than a king. eventually, elend comes to terms with his choices, recognizing himself to be an amalgamation of scholar, nobleman and soldier. elend is the type of person who is always preparing, up until the last minute. religious beliefs[edit] before the collapse, elend believed the lord ruler to be god. however, he didn't worship him; he believed the lord ruler had too much power over the noble houses and read books that defamed the lord ruler and pointed out his mistakes. after the collapse, elend became a member of the church of the survivor. he joined the church as a political move, to gain leverage amongst the skaa assemblymen and backing from the church's followers. he has doubts about the survivorist's doctrines, but he believes it to be better than the alternatives, as the lord ruler is dead and sazed's religions have been dead by centuries. it feels wrong to him to worship vin as divine, but he trusts her as more than a human being, almost like a force. attributes and abilities[edit] elend was born with no allomantic abilities. after swallowing a bead of lerasium at the well of ascension, he becomes mistborn. his allomantic power, not weakened by interbreeding, is stronger than that of contemporary allomancers. though his raw power is bigger than vin's, she is more skilled in its use. he is more comfortable with emotional allomancy than with physical allomancy. with the proper experience, he would be able to use his raw allomantic power to pierce weak copperclouds. though his roots are in philosophy, elend has extensive knowledge on many different subjects. he is proficient in political theory, economics, and military theory. he claims to be no statistician, but he has worked with numbers in his research. history[edit] early history[edit] as a child, elend was beaten to near death to determine whether he was an allomancer. his mother is presumably dead, since he speaks about her in the past tense, but she had a great influence on him. when he was thirteen, his father forced him to sleep with a skaa woman. he was horrified after discovering that she would be killed afterward. elend started to intentionally behave in ways that would enrage his father. for example his clothing was always messy and too huge. he blew several engagements with his attitude. in the end however his acts were pointless, and both he and straff knew it. he started a drinking group with jastes lekal, telden hasting, kevoux, and another young noble, to talk about philosophy and form an alliance to exert pressure on the lord ruler. the group was also at least in part formed to annoy elend's father. while the other young nobles were only interested in more independence from the lord ruler, elend showed interest in the skaa and was horrified by the way they were treated. he wanted to use his power to improve their lives. pre-collapse[edit] elend met vin (disguised as valette) at a ball at keep venture. after returning from getting a drink, he found she was in his reading spot. he began a casual friendship with her, often sitting with her at balls and reading. vin spread the rumor that he's a friend of her family, showing her the ways of the court, so that potential dancing partners aren't intimidated by her. when the house war is imminent, elend decided that ""valette"" had to leave luthadel, because the war would be too dangerous for a little house with no allies. when she ignored him, he broke off the relationship, hoping that it would encourage her to leave the city. at the last ball before the collapse, elariel assassins, including shan elariel and another mistborn, try to kill elend, as well as jastes and telden. straff is collaborating with them, by posting less guards outside elend's room so that the assassins can attack. vin learns about the attack from kliss, and stops the assassination, killing shan. elend only noticed the assassins when one of them fell through his skylight. even then, he thought they were only spies, but worried about some of his books, which were forbidden by the ministry, he fled in a carriage with jastes. when he returned, straff told him it was an assassination attempt, but said his guards had killed the assassins. when the renoux household is riding for execution, elend sees them and, presuming that ""valette"" is with them, attacks the wagons. an inquisitor almost hits him, but kelsier, knowing vin loves elend, attacks the inquisitor and saves his life. the collapse[edit] ""“but... the things he said, mistress... his dreams of a new government, his condemnation of bloodshed and chaos... well, mistress, i fear that i cannot repeat it. i wish i’d had my metalminds, so that i could have memorized his exact words. ”-sazed to vin"" after the skaa riots started, straff venture decided to leave the city. elend, predicting the skaa rebellion would result in a mass bloodshed, decided to stay to try to quell the skaa, to prevent mass slaughter. his father let elend stay, hoping he would be killed by the rebellion or by the lord ruler. elend sent the venture guards and servants to keep lekal, not caring about political differences, to join forces to defend against the skaa upheaval. with five soldiers, he turned himself in, and told dockson not to attack the noble houses. elend explained to him that the nobles wouldn't attack, they would just keep to the safety of their houses. after learning that vin had been captured by the ministry, he and his soldiers, as well as goradel, attacked kredik shaw, buying time for vin to find a metal vial and saving her life. afterward, when seeking help for vin, elend and sazed found skaa rebels slaughtering palace soldiers. the soldiers would try to surrender, but the rebels ignored it and kept slaughtering them. elend, revolted by the sight of the mass slaughtering, stood up and started his speech. he spoke of the dangers of bloodshed and chaos as a basis for a nation, of the need for a stable system, and of his dreams for a new, fairer nation in the central dominance. instead of killing him, the rebels listened to him and stopped fighting, acknowledging that the bloodshed wouldn't accomplish anything. this speech was ultimately the reason elend was crowned king. breeze also helped by soothing away the skaa's anger. the siege of luthadel[edit] king of the central dominance[edit] after the collapse, elend established himself as king of the central dominance. he drafted a law code that applied the philosophies of his books, but had also a strong element of realism. the law code established a parliamentary council called the luthadel assembly, which was composed of twenty-four assemblymen, including elend himself: eight noblemen, eight skaa workers, and eight skaa merchants. a few months later, elend proposed vin in marriage, but she refused, feeling that he deserved a better woman. unfortunately, their army was relatively small and weak, with only about twenty thousand soldiers, and peace didn't last long. a year after the collapse, straff venture lay siege to the town with an army of fifty thousand soldiers. elend passed a proposal for the assembly to wait to decide anything about the future of the city until he had parlayed with straff, and they accepted it. soon later, a second army with forty thousand arrived at the city, led by ashweather cett. breeze had persuaded cett to march on luthadel so that a three-way standoff was created; if either straff or cett attacked luthadel, he would be weakened enough that the other could beat him easily. afterward, tindwyl arrived and (forcefully) started coaching elend in the art of leadership. later, a third army of twenty thousand koloss led by jastes lekal arrives to the city. a few days later, elend went with vin inside straff's camp to parlay. elend offers an alliance against cett's army and bluffs, saying they have the atium cache. elend argues straff can't win without his help, but straff says he already has a treaty with cett, and he'll only agree to the alliance if elend goes to the city's walls and surrenders the city. elend says that if straff killed him, vin would kill straff, and they demonstrate vin's powerful emotional allomancy, ending with vin burning brass with duralumin and soothing away all of his emotion. straff is frightened and agrees to let elend return to the city. however, during the meeting with straff, the assembly had invoked a no-confidence clause, deposing elend from the position of king. the elections for king[edit] in a later meeting, elend nominated ferson penrod to be chancellor to preside over the meetings on the absence of a king, and the motion passes. nominations for king were held; one of the skaa workers nominated penrod. after elend nominated him for chancellor, penrod felt obligated to nominate elend as king, and he did so. finally, philen frandeu nominated cett, who turned out to be hidden within the crowd. cett took residence in keep hasting with a thousand soldiers. after a week, elend met with cett in his keep to parlay. elend said he hasn't found the atium cache. in the day of the election for king, elend announced his conversion to the church of the survivor. he hoped to convince some of the skaa workers to vote for him, in order to create a deadlock so that he kept the position. however, half a dozen of straff's half-skaa misting children attack elend and cett, and vin fought them. after that, the election was held on the same day in penrod's mansion, because it was the last day in a thirty-day deadline to choose the new king. there were fifteen votes for penrod, two to cett, and seven to elend; that would create a deadlock that would have caused elend to remain on the throne. however, after being asked, elend revealed that assemblymen can change their votes. then, the two who voted for cett changed their votes to penrod, making it seventeen votes for him, enough to win the election and become king. it is later revealed that straff had bribed the skaa merchants with the promises of titles if they voted for penrod, and convinced penrod to ally with him against cett. however, he didn't march onto luthadel immediately for fear of vin coming for him. the trip for terris[edit] elend decided that even not being king anymore, he would keep helping the city. he worked on keeping the citizens from freezing, and tries to discover who had poisoned the city's water supply. he met with jastes and warned him the koloss cannot be controlled. on the way back, he attacked one of the koloss and discovered jastes is paying the koloss with fake coins. believing the city would fall, sazed, dockson, breeze and clubs conspired to send elend and vin away, along with spook and tindwyl. vin fought and killed zane, and then asked elend to marry her, and sazed married them with a larsta ceremony. he told them the well of ascension was on derytatith, in order to send them away from the city. they agreed to go there with tindwyl and spook. when they departed, tindwyl decided not to go, and allrianne convinced them to take her with them. shortly after departing, allriane parted ways with them. a group followed them, and they discover it was led by jastes, who was fleeing from luthadel. enraged that jastes had left an uncontrolled group of koloss outside luthadel, elend executed him. then, spook revealed that sazed had tricked elend and vin to get them to safety. vin realized the well is in luthadel, and they immediately returned, with vin going ahead on a pewter drag and later by pulling and pushing on horseshoes and elend and spook following on horses. elend and spook encountered a group of terris refugees on their way to luthadel. they only arrived after the battle of luthadel is over, and vin informed elend he is emperor. the well of ascension[edit] vin and elend found the storage cache in kredik shaw, where the well of ascension is located. when they enter it, leras appears as the mist spirit, intent on dissuading them of giving up the power and freeing ruin. kelsier encouraged leras to stab elend so that vin uses the power of the well to save him, and since leras, being preservation, can't do it, kelsier moved his arm, stabbing elend in the gut. however, vin gave up the power anyway, trusting that that is what elend would have wanted for his people. later, leras saved elend by making vin give him the lerasium bead, turning him into a mistborn and allowing him to burn pewter. the new empire[edit] after the foundation of the new empire, vin and elend set out to recover the five storage caches of the lord ruler. they found the second one in statlin city, containing large amounts of lumber, and a description of aluminum. the second cache was in urteau, and though the city was in control of quellion, vin managed to sneak into it and discover the location of the third storage cache, vetitan, as well as a description of the metal electrum. they conquered vetitan, taking control of a group of ten thousand koloss that were attacking the city, and took its people further towards the center of the empire, where food could still be grown. in the cache, they discovered large quantities of the first eight allomantic metals, as well as a description of malatium and the location of the fifth and final cache, fadrex city, which was held by aradan yomen. the siege of fadrex city[edit] ""“arguing philosophy will not remove the fact that you have an army camped outside my city, nor change the fact that i find you a hypocrite ”-yomen to elend"" after discovering the cache's location, elend marched on fadrex city with forty thousand soldiers, twenty thousand koloss, and a contingent of allomancers. because of the city's fortifications, and of a reluctance to loose the koloss upon people, he decided to lay siege to the city, and try to negotiate with yomen. so, elend and vin went to a ball in keep orielle, inside the city, to talk with the obligator. elend discussed about philosophy with yomen, and was impressed by the man's arguments, that called him a hypocrite for taking the throne by force. after that, elend and vin danced, though he teased her by picking up a copy of trials of monument--the book he was reading when the two first met--and starting to read it. at a suggestion from cett, elend ordered the wells of fadrex city poisoned, and warned the city's people so that they wouldn't get hurt by it. yomen sent a raid on the camp, but it was a distraction; simultaneously, his men threw rocks at the koloss, driving them to a rage that caused them to start killing each other, and half the twenty thousand koloss died. he and vin went to another ball at the canton of resource. there, elend distracted yomen to gain time for vin to search for the cache. however, yomen believed he was the one distracting elend, while vin got trapped in the cache building. fearing that yomen might manipulate him again, instead of negotiating elend decided to go searching for more koloss as a threat to use against yomen. he took control of thirty thousand additional koloss. in his trip back, feeling burdened by his responsibilities, he knelt down in the ash, and almost gives up. however, leras appeared to him as the mist spirit. they communicated with elend asking yes/no questions, and leras answering by waving his arms to indicate a positive answer. he said elend shouldn't attack fadrex city, and pointed at elend's metal vials. elend asked whether ruin can be beaten, and leras waved his arms hesitantly, indicating ""maybe"". he had used his last bits of life to talk with elend, and he died soon after. despite from what leras told elend, the emperor decided to launch a surprise attack on yomen on the next morning. however, he realized vin wouldn't have done this, and decided to pull back. however, ruin took control of the koloss and made them start attacking elend's army. ordering her koloss to attack yomen's army, vin managed to convince the obligator to retreat and let elend's army enter fadrex. an enormous army of koloss began to gather outside the city. seeing a boy being taken by the mistsickness, he realized the mists are snapping the skaa, and the mistfallen are in fact allomancers. even with the new allomancers, the koloss army was too big for elend's and yomen's army to face. however, the koloss retreated, going toward luthadel. yomen gave elend his last atium bead, and elend goes toward luthadel to find vin. the battle of hathsin[edit] ""“lost? we've won, marsh. ”-elend to marsh."" in luthadel, elend found penrod's corpse, with a note saying that elend's people went to the terris dominance. after hearing a whisper from vin, he realized ruin must have changed the text, and deduces that they might have gone to the terris people instead. arriving at the pits of hathsin, he saw demoux with a few soldiers he had sent back to help penrod. elend discovered that the people who stayed sick for longer were seers, atium mistings, and gathered them to fight the koloss army, using the atium cache at the pits. they fought the koloss for hours, until the atium in the atium cache began to run out. then, marsh appeared in front of elend. marsh and elend fought, with marsh using the atium he got from kanpaar. marsh was winning, because elend didn't have any metals other than atium. however, suddenly, his metal reserves were filled again. he looked up, and saw a white figure: vin, helping him fight. then, elend burned atium with duralumin. suddenly, he saw preservation's plan--he knew he had to die, to help to drive vin to kill ruin. he told marsh that ruin's body--the atium--was gone, and that ruin had lost. legacy[edit] after the catacendre, elend became known as the last emperor. the city of elendel was named after him, and there are giant statues of him and vin at the field of rebirth, and his body, fixed by harmony, was buried there. the laws of elendel, created by spook, are based upon elend's philosophical ideals. relationships[edit] vin[edit] ""“she'd never trusted anyone this much. not kelsier, not sazed, not reen. that knowledge made her tremble inside. if she lost him, she would lose herself. ”-vin during the trip towards terris."" vin and elend's first encounter was pure happenstance on the part of vin, but as elend had grown up in the luthadel noble society, he saw everything as being plots within plots, so a hitherto unknown scion of the renoux house just so happening to come to his alcove left him baffled. he became interested in her early on when he saw that vin was entirely forthright in her opinions and actions though still oblivious that she loved him, he did develop love for her when he realised what she had been doing to protect him and she had been captured by the lord ruler. due to vin's nature as a mistborn and her traits trained into her by kelsier as an assassin, she believed he deserved someone better, someone who shared his interests and ideals, someone who saw nobility in his decision of giving up the throne. she also thought she hurt his pride by being mistborn while he was just a common man, that he deserved a woman he could protect. she thought she didn't deserve because she thought she didn't deserve to be happy at all. elend he felt he needed her genuine realism to keep him grounded, and thought himself lucky that she needed him; he believed she was ten times as capable as him. he was sometimes frustrated by her idiosyncrasies, but he still loved her. most of all, he trusted her; he defended her actions even when she attacked cett, killing hundreds of men, and he trusted her to make the right decisions even when he didn't know what she was deciding. at the well of ascension, however, she knew that elend would want her to sacrifice him to save his people, and she loved him enough to trust his wishes and give up the power instead of saving him. during the final years of the world of ash, elend's trust and faith in his wife were shown implicitly by considering her on her own being an army, having complete trust in her during the various fights with and command over koloss armies that they controlled via hemalurgy. coming to a complete understanding during the fight at fadrex by silently explaining their bluff to divert ruin's attention. during the siege of the pits of hathsin and vin's ascension, she assisted elend by providing him additional powerful investiture via contact that remained until the moment he was cut down by marsh, leading to vin's sacrifice as she kills ruin. after their death's and the ascension of sazed as harmony, both elend and vin decline kelsier's offer to remain in the cognitive realm and journey on together into the beyond. kelsier[edit] ""“early in my career, i always compared myself to him. by the time i heard of kelsier, he was already becoming a legend. it was unfair to force myself to try and be him, but i worried regardless. ”-elend talking to the crew about kelsier"" in the battle before kelsier's death, despite his hate of noblemen, he saved elend's life because he knew vin loved the nobleman. but when he found out that elend was king, he was angry for days. however, when elend came to him in the well, he wasn't angry, because he considered not elend's fault that he became king, considering him ""too oblivious to be dangerous"". while king, elend compared himself to kelsier on numerous occasions, even though they had never really met. he thought that if kelsier were alive, he would be king instead of elend, and that he would have been a better king than elend. however, he later accepted that there was no one mold for a leader, and that he didn't need to be kelsier to be a good king. tindwyl[edit] ""“you have good ideas, elend venture. regal ideas. however, you are not a king. a man can only lead when others accept him as their leader, and he has only as much authority as his subjects give to him. all of the brilliant ideas in the world cannot save your kingdom if no one will listen to them. ”-tindwyl to elend"" tindwyl came to luthadel to instruct elend on how to be a king. she thinks that he is slovenly and needs to be more forceful--that as a king, he should impose his will on others and impose respect on his subjects. she believes he should be more self-confident--feel that his actions are the best for the kingdom. she is mean and harsh to him, because she believes that after growing up as a pampered son of a lord, he needs some harsh truth. tindwyl says that love is not easy for kings, and that elend's love of vin may cause him trouble. however, once she was sure he did love vin, the keeper says he should not give up on her; she considers it an exception. however, she encourages the couple to get married, as it would be bad for elend's reputation to be seen as having a mistress. straff venture[edit] ""“that’s what his books had done to him--they had changed him from rebellious fop into would-be philosopher. unfortunately, he’d been a fool for so long. was it any wonder that straff hadn’t noticed the change in his son? ”-elend to straff"" in his youth, elend rebelled against his father, straff, and acted to distinguish himself from the man. however, he only did it in small ways, that didn't matter much, such as wearing his clothes dishevelled and reading during balls. he ended up earning a reputation for being eccentric and arrogant. however, his books changed him; he stopped acting against his father's wishes to annoy him, and started doing it because they were unethical. his father didn't notice the change, and kept treating elend like a rebellious child. straff thinks elend is childish and weak, and believes vin didn't kill the lord ruler because he thinks it implausible that elend has earned the trust of someone so powerful. straff thinks he can control elend, and that he can make elend give him control of the city. elend knows straff well, and is confident he can manipulate his father. dockson[edit] ""“and we put one of them on the throne. i can’t help but think that kell would be angry with me for letting elend rule, no matter how good a man he is. ”-dockson to vin"" dockson and elend dislike each other; however, they're willing to work with one another for the good of the kingdom. dockson acknowledges that elend is a decent man and treats the skaa fairly, but he has resented noblemen for a long time, and he thinks kelsier would be mad at him for letting a nobleman take the throne. dockson also resents elend because dockson assumed he would be the leader of the crew once kelsier was dead, but elend became king instead. elend knows dockson is a good man, but he finds it hard to get along with dockson because of his dislike of the king. trivia[edit] - elend means - in german, but this wasn't intentional. - elend's character is inspired by brandon's editor - , - and also by - elend and vin never gave much thought to the prospect of being a parent. - elend's speech in the collapse was inspired by the - . - elend's - color alignment would probably be blue/white. notes[edit]"
Cognitive Shadow,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cognitive_shadow,"""“and if you let a man die with too invested a soul-or invest him right as he’s dying-he’ll leave behind a shadow you can nail back onto a body. ”-zahel’s description of a cognitive shadow"" cognitive shadow is a term used to refer to a spirit that has not yet moved into the afterlife. while the manifestations of this kind of entity can vary depending on the world it occurs on, cognitive shadows can occur on any planet in the cosmere. vasher refers to them as a type two invested entity. mechanics[edit] cognitive shadows can be created by a variety of processes. some of them are created when a person has sufficient attachment to something in the physical realm. when a vessel that has held onto a shard for a long time dies it becomes a cognitive shadow that can continue to act. the cognitive aspect of a recently deceased person can become a cognitive shadow by finding a source of investiture to anchor themselves to the cognitive realm before passing on to the beyond. the investiture replaces the parts of the soul that connects it to the three realms, providing an anchor for it in the cognitive realm. some vessels can prepare a cognitive shadow at or just prior to their death or splintering, allowing a portion of their power to continue to function with a small amount of direction; the stormfather is an example of this. it is theoretically possible for a cognitive shadow to form a nahel bond with a human. they are not able to burn god metals. they may be able to create objects from nothing, if they view it as an extension of themselves. cognitive shadows look different in the cognitive realm, where how they became a cognitive shadow will influence how they look. shards could create a physical body for cognitive shadows. destruction[edit] a cognitive shadow can be permanently killed by the use of a raysium dagger touching a gem of anti-light of the type of investiture associated with the cognitive shadow. for instance, a raysium dagger with an anti-voidlight gem can permanently kill a fused, and a herald can presumably be similarly killed with anti-stormlight. cognitive shadows will turn into sunhearts when exposed to the sun on canticle. additionally, cognitive shadows can be killed by negating their connection to all three realms, a process which destroys the anchor against the pull of the beyond. the experience is described as having your soul ripped apart. a cognitive shadow can also willingly choose to pass into the beyond. cognitive influence[edit] cognitive shadows are influenced by how people view them over time, although this takes centuries due to their own strong sense of self. but cognitive shadows with less sense of self, or less controlled by another source, are more easily malleable by cognitive influence. cognitive shadows that are normally invisible to people in the physical realm can still be seen and heard by people who exist partly in the cognitive realm. examples[edit] roshar[edit] when the singers turned to odium for help in fighting off the humans, he responded by infusing some of them with his power, which turned them into cognitive shadows. they reside on braize, but return to roshar during every desolation. since they lost their bodies long ago, they must possess the bodies of living singers; in doing so they destroy the mind of the possessed body. this cycle of rebirth strains the minds of the fused and, eventually, they go crazy.their status as cognitive shadows grants them access to the surges. odium could remove the investiture that maintains a fused, which would send that fused to the beyond. when the heralds of the almighty took up the oathpact, they gained a direct connection to honor. this connection transformed them into cognitive shadows. each time they return to roshar, a new body is created for them. unlike the returned, they do not need to consume investiture to remain in their bodies. prior to odium's splintering of honor, the stormfather was just the spren of the highstorm and one of the three bondsmith spren. after honor's death, the cognitive shadow of its vessel, tanavast, merged with the stormfather, though it does not appear that the stormfather has tanavast's memories. scadrial[edit] ""“look at you kelsier! you haven't form or shape. you're not alive, you're an idea. a memory of a man holding the power will never be as potent as a real one with ties to all three realms.”-ruin on kelsier's ascension"" after his death, kelsier found the well of ascension in the cognitive realm and, with leras' help, merged with it. as a result, he became infused with preservation's power and became a cognitive shadow, though, since the well was created as a prison, he was unable to leave. after vin released ruin from the well he was able to travel the scadrian cognitive realm and influence the physical realm, though he was unable to actually leave the cognitve realm because his ""ties to the physical realm [had] been severed"" by his death. with the help of a device made by the ire, he was able to hold the shard of preservation after leras died, though, according to ruin, he made for a weaker vessel than a normal person. some time after the catacendre, kelsier found a way to recreate his physical body using hemalurgy and return to the physical realm. upon death, he lost his ability to use allomancy and has not recovered it despite regaining a body. nalthis[edit] when endowment returns someone after death, she uses a divine breath to ""staple"" the cognitive shadow of the deceased person back to that person's body. this process results in the returned losing any memories of their prior life. returned must consume one breath every eight days to fuel their divine breath. vasher states that he is a type two invested entity because he died while “drenched in power” and left behind a “fossil of a soul”. if a lifeless were created with extra breath, that breath might start to take on a ""personality"" like a cognitive shadow would have. threnody[edit] shades are a unique kind of cognitive shadow found on threnody that are able to interact with the physical realm. they are drawn by anyone moving quickly at night, lighting a fire, or drawing blood and their touch withers a person, which usually results in death. any person or animal killed by a shade becomes a shade. it is unknown how the first shades were created, though, when nazh first meets kelsier, he is shocked that kelsier managed to become a cognitive shadow and says it is ""an important rite ... with requirements and traditions."" shades are repelled and can be harmed by silver, though it is unknown whether this applies to other kinds of cognitive shadows as well. they also are not as self-aware as normal cognitive shadows. if some other cognitive shadow traveled to threnody, he or she would not become a shade, and if a shade managed to leave threnody, it would not be destroyed. differences between shades and normal cognitive shadows are a result of the nature of the investiture on threnody and the lack of a shard. komashi[edit] nightmares are former inhabitants of the kingdom of torio, who are kept in servitude under the father machine. they were killed by the father machine, which absorbed their souls and destroyed their bodies. during the night, the control of the machine over them loosens, and they wander the planet looking for humans for cognitive activity to feed off of. following the destruction of the father machine and dissolution of the shroud, they dissolved into investiture and vanished. they are defended against by painters, who are able to force them into more harmless shapes, forcing them to dissolve away into black mist. the yoki-hijo reformed after being killed by the father machine due to how heavily invested they were. the father machine subsequently trapped them in simulations of their former life, constantly erasing their memory, and having them repeat a simulation of the same day ad infinitum. hijo are able to form a spiritual connection between two individuals and have them swap bodies with each other. those linked will swap bodies every day, where one is in control of the other's body while the other is a cognitive shadow. this connection can be forcibly severed, causing the two to no longer swap bodies. trivia[edit] - the mist spirit that vin sees during - is not a cognitive shadow. depending on the scene, it was an actual manifestation of preservation - or ruin's imitation of that manifestation. notes[edit]"
Earth (Skyward),https://coppermind.net/wiki/Earth_(Skyward),"""“did you know that even then, with computers and libraries and all kinds of reminders, we found it easy to forget where we came from? ”-becca nightshade"" earth, sometimes called the old earth, is the home planet of humans in the cytoverse. during the early days of humanity's contact with aliens, earth was ruled by a single institution called the united governments, aided by the united intelligence bureau. the phone company, the telecom that served as the liaisons between humanity and aliens, was also headquartered there. over time, however, the planet grew largely irrelevant. even its location seems to have been forgotten, with some people incorrectly speculating that detritus might be earth's ruins. nonetheless, both astrophysical data and numerous historical records of old earth remain within humanity's and superiority's data banks. by the time the superiority became a major power, earth appears to have vanished. whether it simply means it can't be found on any star charts, or if it's somehow no longer where it should be, is unclear. notes[edit]"
Trellium,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Trellium,"trellium, also known as bavadinium, is the god metal of autonomy. properties[edit] trellium is a silvery metal with a red cast to it, and dark red spots similar to rust. like other god metals, it displays many unusual properties. it is notable for repelling other forms of investiture, with a force proportional to how close it is to the source of investiture. this causes it to try and roll away when in the proximity of harmonium, hemalurgic spikes or an allomancer burning metals. chemical properties[edit] the hardness of the metal is just above a nine, as it is scratched by diamond, but barely marks corundum. it is also very brittle. it has an extraordinarily high melting point, above 3,000 degrees. when heated, it lets off the full visual spectrum of light (i.e. it appears perfectly white), with the red portion of the spectrum going off the spectrometric scale. interactions with harmonium[edit] when an electric current is passed through harmonium, the metal softens and its investiture begins to polarize, becoming more atium-like on one end and more lerasium-like on the other. if trellium is inserted between the two poles, a violent reaction occurs, as some of the harmonium's investiture or matter is converted into pure energy. the resultant blast is extremely powerful; converting less than half a gram of harmonium into energy is capable of destroying a thick safe and the fortified room around it. this interaction can be used to create powerful bombs; however, as these weapons rely upon a novel energy release mechanism, not even autonomy or harmony fully understand their true destructive potential. in addition, the explosion produces small amounts of lerasium and atium. harmony uses this effect to manufacture atium. allomantic use[edit] when burned by an allomancer, trellium has unknown properties. feruchemical use[edit] when used by a feruchemist, trellium has unknown properties. hemalurgic use[edit] trellium can steal allomantic and feruchemical abilities and grant them to kandra. presumably its hemalurgic ability is similar to that of atium, allowing the transfer of any ability with somewhat variable success depending on the binding point. using it as a hemalurgic spike can keep the user hidden from harmony. this has a limited effect, however, and any more than a single spike will make the user visible to the shard. it is an inherent property of the metal, and not a hemalurgic attribute, that hides the user. using trellium as a spike allows users to communicate with others. they can speak to others who have a hemalurgic spike, but they cannot hear their thoughts. they can also create a connection with autonomy's avatars, allowing them to communicate and feel each other's presence. some individuals spiked with trellium exhibit glowing red eyes at times. this behavior is inconsistent; granks's eyes start faintly glowing during his fight with marasi, then the glow becomes vivid when he is near death. the glow fades once marasi removes his trellium spike and he dies. furthermore, autonomy herself can act and speak through an individual spiked by a trellium spike. hemalurgic constructs[edit] hemalurgic chimeras are created when a living human is implanted with a trellium spike in a specific manner. trivia[edit] - in the - adventure game supplement, trellium allows kandra to use the allomantic or feruchemical abilities of another hemalurgic spike they are spiked with. they also cannot be controlled by harmony or brass allomancy, but they also lose the non-sapience half of their blessing. notes[edit]"
Shu-Keseg,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Shu-Keseg,"shu-keseg is a religion practiced on the selish continent known as opelon (aonic term) or sycla (fjordell term), as well as the nearby nation of teod. two opposing sects, shu-korath and shu-dereth, later developed from this parent religion. beliefs[edit] shu-keseg’s core ideals center around unity - specifically unity of ‘’mind’’ - and acceptance. its followers believe in a single, omnipotent god named dashu. origins & history[edit] shu-keseg was founded by a jindo man named keseg who preached the power of unity. the religion’s teachings are held in a book called the do-kando. sects[edit] keseg’s students, korath and dereth, left jindo to spread shu-keseg, but they disagreed about how to achieve the central tenet of unity. korath preached that mankind should be united through love, whereas dereth taught of achieving unity through obedience. this schism resulted in the two opposing sects of shu-korath and shu-dereth. cultural influence[edit] the nation of fjorden, the home of shu-dereth, used the new religion as an excuse to conquer nearby nations under the guise of divine unification. notable members[edit] - countries - the nation of jindo, while officially converted to shu-dereth to avoid war, still primarily practices shu-keseg. - people - - a baron of - , originally from jindo notes[edit]"

Sanderson's Laws of Magic,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sanderson%27s_Laws_of_Magic,"brandon has so far written three articles pertaining to the usage of magic in writing. they aren't hard rules, but rather guidelines brandon uses when writing. they can also be used for writing in general, not just for magic systems. sanderson's first law[edit] if characters (especially viewpoint characters) solve a problem by use of magic, the reader should be made to understand how that magic works. otherwise, the magic can constitute a deus ex machina. ideally, the magic is explained to the reader before it is used to resolve a conflict. much like a sword or a large sum of money, magic is a useful tool. understanding the tools available to a character helps the reader understand the character's actions. it avoids questions like, ""where did he get that?"" or ""how did he do that?"" ""mysterious magic"" (or ""soft magic""), which has no clearly defined rules, should, in genre fantasy, not solve problems, although it may create them. soft magic in genre fantasy is usually used to create a sense of awe and wonder, and the workings of it aren't known to the reader and most characters. brandon has said that j.r.r. tolkien and george r.r martin's use of magic is a good example of a soft magic system. ""hard magic"" on the other hand has rules explicitly described by the author, meaning that the reader can understand the magic so that solving problems with it doesn't seem to ""mystically make everything better"". instead, it's the characters' wit and experience that solves the problems. this makes magic a tool which can be used to solve problems and enhance the story. l.e. modesitt jr. and melanie rawn, according to brandon, write in this way. the middle ground is a situation where the reader knows some of the limits and possibilities of the magic but doesn't understand its workings. brandon has cited the magic in j.k. rowling's harry potter series as a great example. sanderson's second law[edit] the limitations of a magic system are more interesting than its capabilities. what the magic can't do is more interesting than what it can. limitations[edit] great limitations on magic systems will do many things, they will for example create struggle. it'll make characters work for their goals and if the magic system is limited it’ll make the writer and the character have to be more clever. sanderson offers his own allomantic steel and iron as examples of this: they allow you telekinesis with a few limitations, the characters can only push or pull directly away or toward themselves and the objects must be made of metal. this forces characters to work harder and encourages better writing. an excellent magic system will also create tension, as the outcome is not obvious and makes the whole scene appear more dramatic. for example: superman fighting an enemy is not very tense. but superman fighting an enemy with kryptonite is a lot more tense. it can also create depth in the characters and the system alike. for example: a character whose power is flight. but impose a limitation where she can only fly when she is happy. her mood and ability to fly are both now directly tied into the plot. limitations on what the magic can do can be simple - can't use when too tired, can only be used in the sunlight- but more complex ones are more interesting. sanderson gives us an example from david eddings' the belgariad: the ""will and the word"". a nearly limitless magic with nigh infinite power. you can make just about anything but cannot unmake or destroy. this limitation shapes the magic as a whole and tells the reader something of the magic's very nature. weaknesses and costs[edit] weaknesses and costs alike make a magic system more interesting. weaknesses are generally harder to keep sensible and the kryptonite example has become a staple of easy storytelling. brandon encourages writers to make up more interesting weaknesses than ""lose powers if x"". costs on the other hand are a great way of limiting a character and the use of the magic. in the wheel of time series the cost is that the users of the magic will slowly go insane. although the metals in mistborn and the stormlight in the stormlight archive may sound like costs, they are actually limitations. metals and stormlight aren’t crucial to the characters or the plot outside of magic, and thus only limit the abilities of the user. sanderson's third law[edit] ""a brilliant magic system for a book is less often one with a thousand different powers and abilities -- and is more often a magic system with relatively few powers that the author has considered in depth."" extrapolation[edit] it is important to consider the effects that a magic will have on a world. if for example your magic can create food out of thin air, what will that cause, what will happen? how will it affect trade, politics, warfare, education and social norms? asking these questions and working out what effects your magic system will add depth to your world. interconnection[edit] another important point is to be interconnected. try to make the powers of a character seem like a coherent whole rather than separate abilities. in mistborn, for example, magics were designed to be what thieves would want and then the powers named accordingly. tying your powers together thematically is an important part of worldbuilding and expands the world, rather than adding to it. streamlining[edit] streamlining is also important in any magic system. combining pre-existing magics and powers is often better than adding new ones. a different culture reacting to a magic entirely differently than what has been shown so far, is often better than a culture with its own unrelated magic system. for example: a simple heat-generating magic may be used by different cultures in very different ways. a warlike culture might use it for assault or for forging weapons, a peaceful one for heating and preparing food, for merchants for making products, nomads for powering transportation and so on. remember, however, not to streamline too far as that will make the single culture or character seem too packed and might decrease their plausibility. sanderson's zeroth law[edit] brandon has, in his online lectures, described his ultimate rule as that of making magic ""awesome"" (in the colloquial sense), and further implied that said ""awesomeness"" takes precedence over exact obedience to the other three laws. this rule is primarily to be understood in the sense of beginning with an interesting (i.e. ""awesome"") idea, and building the magic system or fantastical technology upon said idea from there, rather than to simply disregarding the previously mentioned laws - rather, those laws should bend to the ""awesomeness"" of the idea, and not take priority over it, thus keeping the idea behind the magic system ""awesome"". the naming of this law is a reference to isaac asimov's zeroth law of his three laws of robotics. notes[edit]"

Steel Inquisitor,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Inquisitors,"the steel inquisitors were a type of hemalurgic construct on scadrial created from humans. steel inquisitors were created and controlled by the lord ruler as the policing force for his ministries. the steel inquisitors made up the canton of inquisition whose job it was to control the use and spread of allomancy. description and physiology[edit] the most notable feature is the large steel spikes where their eyes should be. these spikes fill the eye socket and protrude out the back of the head by several inches. steel inquisitors, like the obligators from which they were created, are bald with a large number of tattoos spreading from their eye sockets across their heads. these tattoos indicate many things, including rank and what kind of allomancer the obligator was before recruitment. the number of spikes that the lord ruler's steel inquisitors have varies based on the availability of mistings and feruchemists to sacrifice, but they generally have between nine and eleven spikes in total: two through the eye sockets, one in the middle of the spine on the back, and six to eight in the torso. although created from humans, they are physiologically and mentally distinct. they can, however, still mate with humans. children from steel inquisitors are more likely to be allomancers compared to children from two humans, but the strength of allomancy and feruchemy would still weaken over time. there are also complications that can happen with the children of an inquisitor. steel inquisitors have slightly longer lifespans compared to humans. creation[edit] according to aradan yomen, one of the ways in which the number 16 made itself known in their time was that the lord ruler had originally made 16 steel inquisitors. the number 16 in relation to the inquisitors showed up once again, as ruin created or otherwise used 16 inquisitors to further his goals during the time after the collapse (as there were 13 during the final battle, while elend and vin had already dispatched 3 previously). to create an inquisitor, metal spikes are inserted at various points in the subject's body by hammering the metal spike through the heart of a misting or feruchemist into the new inquisitor; this reduces the loss of power through the hemalurgic process due to the spike spending a minimal amount of time outside of a body. these spikes, now hemalurgically charged, tear into and forcibly splice information from the victim to the subject's spiritweb. this process moves vital organs, allowing the spikes to be inserted practically anywhere without fatally wounding the subject. the process is not painless for either person involved, as both violent changes to the spiritweb and having metal spikes driven into one's body causes pain. the steel spikes inserted into eye sockets allow the inquisitor to navigate via the blue allomantic lines from the traces of metals in everything. the spikes create a chain in an inquisitor's body, and there is a central spike or 'linchpin' that acts as a connector to the lower and upper spikes. if this spike is removed, the inquisitor dies. a linchpin is needed to avoid deadly side effects if four or more spikes are used on an inquisitor. inquisitors are typically granted many allomantic and some feruchemical abilities (detailed below). these abilities are granted on top of the inquisitor's own natural allomantic powers (if any), and any abilities the subject had prior to the transformation are augmented by the spikes. as such, mistborn and seekers were the preferred subjects, as their increased seeking ability would allow them to pierce copperclouds. there are forty-seven known bindpoints that can be used for an inquisitor. eleven are physical, twelve are mental, twelve are temporal, and twelve are spiritual. there are no differences in bindpoints between males and females. to grant every possible allomantic and feruchemical power, it would take thirty two spikes (one for each power) plus a linchpin, leaving room for fourteen extra spikes. regular humans who were turned into inquisitors could fully remember who they were and what life had been like before their transformation. during the days after the collapse, ruin gave his inquisitors several advantages which the lord ruler had never allowed them, lest they become too strong. this included extra spikes to give them additional feruchemical powers, as well as a metal plate which would cover the linchpin spike between their shoulder blades. weaknesses[edit] steel inquisitors were very powerful and - with feruchemical healing - nearly invincible. rumors in the skaa underground held that inquisitors were immortal, that they could see into people's souls, and that they were warriors with no equal. however, removing spikes from an inquisitor could effectively kill them, most notably the linchpin spike located between the shoulder blades. this was a weakness built into them by the lord ruler. similarly, inquisitors could not survive a beheading. removing one eye spike is not enough to kill most inquisitors. inquisitors also require much more rest and sleep than a normal human would, which may be related to the burden placed upon their souls by the nature of their transformations. another major weakness in inquisitors came from the hemalurgic spikes, though this was not a problem before ruin was released. any spike in a person allows for influence to be more easily pushed on them via the tears in their spiritweb. these tears allow certain allomancers to control a hemalurgic construct. this weakness is also present in both kandra and koloss. this weakness allowed them to be controlled by ruin - the more spikes they had, the greater the weakness was. however, the stronger a creature's will, the more it can resist that influence or even break free from it for a time. because of their hemalurgic origins, all steel inquisitors were able to hear the voice of ruin. powers[edit] all inquisitors exhibit a high tolerance to pain and most forms of physical damage. depending on which hemalurgic spikes the inquisitor had, their abilities could vary immensely. the number of spikes varied; marsh had eleven pre-collapse, and after the collapse an inquisitor at vetitan had a new one. after ruin took control of them, marsh was given 10 more spikes, making him the most powerful inquisitor. - steel spikes: inquisitors had five steel spikes. they had one spike in their back between their shoulder blades, which sealed together all the other spikes. then they had one spike in each eye and two between the ribs, to give them the four allomantic physical powers (iron, steel, tin, and pewter). - with the spike through their eyes, inquisitors weren't able to see normally, but they could see via the blue lines that appeared when they burned iron or steel; in fact, it is possible that they didn't need to burn anything to see the lines. - bronze spikes: inquisitors had four bronze spikes between the ribs, to give them the four allomantic mental powers (zinc, brass, copper, and bronze). - the ministry often made inquisitors from people who already had the power to reveal allomancy by burning bronze (either - or - ), so that the spike would enhance that power beyond the normal amount, and allow them to pierce copperclouds. - atium spike: most inquisitors were able to see into other people's futures by burning atium. - this would've been gained by an atium spike. it was located in their chest. - not all inquisitors had this spike. - gold spike: most inquisitors had a gold spike between the ribs to give them the hybrid feruchemy ability to store health. - not all inquisitors had this ability; - those who did often spent much of their time resting so as to store up reserves of health. - pewter spikes: gained after ruin's release, the inquisitor at vetitan had a pewter spike through his heart which granted the physical feruchemical ability to store physical speed. - brass spikes: gained after ruin's release, granted cognitive feruchemical abilities, such as mental speed. - electrum spikes: gained after ruin's release, granted enhancement allomantic abilities, such as - . only a few, such as marsh, were given these, and they had to be taken from mistborn. inquisitors who had been made from mistborn were notably more powerful, having their allomantic abilities almost doubled. some of the inquisitors who obtained feruchemical spikes also discovered how to compound, gaining more power from their metalminds. this is not something the lord ruler taught the inquisitors. compounding was something they had to figure out themselves. known steel inquisitors[edit] inquisitors after the final ascension[edit] the inquisitors' spikes were melted down by harmony to make earrings, and given to members of the path by assorted kandra. melaan gave waxillium ladrian his earring. marsh is the only known surviving inquisitor. inquisitors are often depicted as ravens in post-catacendre artwork and are known as the lord ruler's wraiths ""of whom only death himself remained."" trivia[edit] - the early editions of the books said feruchemical healing was granted by pewter spikes, - even though the hemalurgic table says pewter spikes only give physical feruchemical abilities. - the early editions didn't mention the health spike in the hero of ages chapter 5. - later editions of the books changed that to a gold spike in both places. - a group of inquisitors is called a murder. - kelsier was not the first person to kill a steel inquisitor. notes[edit]"
Shallan Davar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Shallan,"""“i seek the truth. wherever it may be, whoever may hold it. that's who i am. ”-shallan to iyatil"" shallan davar, whose alters are known as veil and radiant, is a lighteyed lightweaver of the knights radiant from jah keved. shallan is an emerging scholar whose greatest achievement is the discovery of the legendary city urithiru. she is also renowned for her extraordinary talent of accurately reproducing even fleeting scenes with photographic accuracy. hailing from a mid-level noble house in jah keved, shallan lived a sheltered life on her father's estate until the age of seventeen, when she left to seek an apprenticeship under princess jasnah kholin as a scholar. while acting as an apprentice to jasnah kholin, she became the causal betrothed of jasnah's cousin, prince adolin kholin, who she later married following the battle of thaylen field. she also learns of and shares in jasnah's quest to stop the mysterious and calamitous voidbringers. shallan has a bond with the cryptic pattern, allowing her to manifest pattern as a shardblade and giving her access to her powers as a surgebinder. eventually, during the battle of narak, her bond with pattern allowed her to become the first lightweaver to be revealed as a knight radiant since the recreance. she is bonded to a deadeye cryptic named testament as well and can summon her as a shardblade in addition to pattern. appearance and personality[edit] shallan is a slim, pale-skinned young woman in her late teens with auburn-red hair that reaches past the middle of her back and blue eyes. there are freckles on her cheeks and nose, although they aren't very noticeable. she is five foot six inches tall in rosharan measurements, which translates to roughly six standard feet. as a child, shallan was considered shy, quiet, and delicate, although she has always had a quick wit, and often uttered the first retort that came to mind. her brother, balat, considered her incapable of handling herself and the family's affairs, having never lived away from the family estates. indeed, shallan was initially naive and inexperienced, with little concept of money; for example, while trying to remain inconspicuous, she overpaid for some street food by two hundred fifty times. however, when she left the family estates behind, she quickly opened up and gained confidence. despite her timidity, shallan can also have a temper at times, a trait that she inherited from her father. shallan is bisexual but is too culturally biased to acknowledge it. veil, however, does acknowledge it. mental health[edit] ""“i have this uncanny ability to hide away anything i don't want to think about. it … it’s getting harder, but for most things, i can just… there. gone. ”-shallan"" shallan closely resembles someone with dissociative identity disorder, as demonstrated by her struggle to maintain a singular personality. while she initially developed her separate personalities such as veil and radiant to fit the various roles she was assigned to, shallan began to use them as crutches. she repeatedly mentioned that these separate personalities had not experienced the hardships shallan had dealt with, so she was able to conveniently use her lightweaving abilities as an escape from her past. while she was able to maneuver through different social situations with these personalities, shallan soon found that it was becoming increasingly difficult to separate her personas from her original personality. she began to experience blackouts and even failed to differentiate between her three personalities until her allies intervened as seen in the battle of thaylen field. in addition to this, shallan is sometimes not in full control of her other personalities as they tend to peek out without her knowing. this is especially common with her first persona, veil. despite all of this, shallan and her alters are still a single individual in the spiritual realm. veil[edit] after arriving at the shattered plains and encountering the ghostbloods, shallan took on the identity of veil to infiltrate the ghostbloods. she changed her appearance by using her lightweaving abilities to craft a new appearance for veil. as veil, shallan appears as a slightly older darkeyed woman. although veil has the same height and build as shallan, veil has long, dark hair and an angular face with a scar across the chin. veil's personality is daring and bold, being an accomplished con artist and spy. she's willing to scam other people but still needs people to be around. she often drinks and will sometimes drink horneater lager which is supposedly the strongest drink in all of roshar. she rarely shows signs of being drunk. veil prefers her men to be hard and rugged, showing interest in men like kaladin while expressing disinterest in adolin. following shallan's marriage with adolin, however, veil has become fond of the prince and even became a drinking buddy with him. veil is often forceful in getting shallan to confront her past, and eventually reveals her own role in helping shallan to suppress her memories. shallan recognizes particular memories suppressed through veil, and by doing so veil reintegrates with shallan. radiant[edit] after arriving in urithiru, shallan developed a third personality, radiant, in order to better assume her role as a knight radiant. due to the similar mannerisms, she is likely based on jasnah kholin. appearance-wise, radiant looks mostly like shallan, but with blond hair and a bigger bust. radiant learned how to wield her shardblade with adolin, and is a capable surgebinder like shallan. she does not care at all about how other people think of her and easily dismisses people as stupid. like veil, she also thinks a relationship with kaladin would be appropriate, commenting that a relationship between two radiants would be suitable. after veil was reintegrated with shallan, radiant remained with the plan to eventually reintegrate as well. attributes and abilities[edit] surgebinding[edit] because of her nahel bond with her spren, pattern, shallan possesses the ability to surgebind. she has access to the surges of illumination and transformation. as with all surgebinders, she has superhuman endurance, strength, and healing when she holds stormlight. she has demonstrated her ability to soulcast multiple times, though the full scope of her abilities remains yet to be seen. the surge of transformation allows shallan to use soulcasting. she discovered that she could soulcast without the need of a fabrial after visiting shadesmar and changing a goblet into blood. she then learned that the soulcaster she had been determined to steal was a nonfunctional fake and that jasnah could also soulcast without one. she used this ability to sink the wind's pleasure by turning the ship into water during an assassination attempt on jasnah by the ghostbloods. while stranded in shadesmar with kaladin, adolin, azure, and their spren, shallan showed the ability to influence the cognitive realm as seen when she used the spheres found in the world to create structures such as bridges and walls. shallan has the ability to project incorporeal images into existence. at the behest of jasnah, shallan focused on this surge rather than transformation. due to a lack of practice and experience, however, she could initially only create the images after sketching them first, and she was unable to make them move. she later discovered that she could use pattern to project sounds and move her images when they were in them. after trial and error, shallan learned that the range of the images she creates is limited to their proximity to a source of investiture. as the user moves away from an image it will begin to blur and then dissolve when its connection is broken, increased focus on the part of a user can increase the range but not greatly. after practicing her abilities, shallan learned how to make her illusions move without the aid of her spren. she was also shown to use illumination without drawing her images beforehand as seen when she conjured images from a play she watched as a child and, later, an army to fight the odium's forces. in addition to this, shallan learned how to produce sounds without the aid of pattern as seen when she was able to alter her voice whilst disguised as veil. during the battle of kholinar, shallan was capable of making more solid illusions. while the reason for this is unknown, jasnah commented that shallan's projections appeared to have some substance to them as if they had more stormlight than usual while shallan briefly wondered if she mixed her soulcasting abilities with this surge. shallan's illumination abilities also seem to be able to harm some of the unmade as seen during her encounter with unmade, re-shephir. during the battle, shallan was able to repel the forces conjured by the spren by simply using the light emitted from her illusions. when combining her illumination abilities with dalinar's own abilities, shallan was shown to be able to construct a visual map of roshar entirely out of stormlight even though she had not visited the entire continent. like all knights radiant, shallan possesses a resonance. shallan has the ability to deliberately memorize a scene after which she can paint or draw it with remarkable accuracy. shallan's ability to memorize scenes and reproduce them accurately seems similar to the ability of an archivist to store memories in a coppermind, in that both talents involve the removal of memory from the mind and its replacement in another medium - in shallan's case, a sketch rather than a coppermind. she is able to reproduce text as well as images. it is unknown how her ability to do so remained after she killed testament. artistry[edit] shallan had a passion for learning and also a great talent for drawing. she was never without her sketchbooks and charcoal, so she might draw whatever caught her interest. shallan frequently drew and made notes on the world around her, in order to promote her calling of natural history. with the use of her memory, shallan can make complete duplicates of images she has retained in her mind and accurately reproduce those images on paper. even when not utilizing her memory, shallan has shown to be very skilled at drawing. many have commented on her skill and even sought out a picture of themselves for her to draw. with her drawings, shallan seems to have the unique ability to inspire the people she draws and motivate them to become better versions of themselves as seen when she changed gaz from a selfish and cruel sergeant to a hopeful and even loyal soldier. her art also seems to be influenced by the presence of the unmade re-shephir. when re-shephir was residing in the lower levels of urithiru, shallan's drawings became more abstract and surrealistic without her being aware of it-these effects disappeared after re-shephir was banished. it is unclear if this was due to re-shephir's general presence in the tower city, or whether there is some kind of connection between this unmade and those with access to the surge of illumination. swordsmanship[edit] shallan has begun training in swordsmanship with adolin as her teacher. due to her aversion to her shardblade, she developed her radiant persona in order to comfortably wield the weapon. while not an expert, she has shown to be quite capable while under the control of radiant. history[edit] early life (1156-1173)[edit] early childhood[edit] shallan was born into the davar household to lin and her mother in mid-1156. she was the youngest of five children, with four older brothers: helaran, balat, wikim, and jushu. as the davar household was a mid-level noble family, the patriarch, lin, held the fourth dahn while shallan herself was of the fifth dahn. the davar family's estates were located in highprince valam's territory in jah keved, north of valath. in some instances, shallan recalls happy memories from her early childhood--such as a time when her parents loved to tell her stories. on the other hand, the mysterious dealings of her mother and the attention her family drew from the cryptics suggest a more disquieting family life. by 1167 shallan's mother had been associating with a certain group of ""friends,"" including a man by the name of dreder, who would occasionally visit the family's estates. these people were associated with the skybreakers and at least one of their number, with whom shallan's mother had an intimate relationship, was a skybreaker acolyte. at some point, shallan bonded the cryptic testament, and spoke the first ideal at a young age. their early interactions with one another took place in the family's gardens, where shallan would bring her daydreams to life by practicing lightweaving. it is unclear whether these experiences were a means for shallan to deal with a troubled childhood or simply the play of an imaginative young girl. ""“a familiar lullaby, one he always used to sing to her. in the room behind him, dark corpses stretched out on the floor. a red carpet once white.”-lin sings ""sleep my baby dear"" to comfort his daughter"" at the age of eleven, shallan's mother discovered that her daughter was a surgebinder. her mother and a friend confronted lin, trying to argue that something must be done about shallan. the argument became a fight after the unfamiliar man drew a knife, apparently intended for shallan. she watched as her father and the man struggled, her father scoring a cut on the man's arm before being pinned to the ground. her mother seized the knife and moved for shallan, prompting shallan to summon testament as a shardblade in self-defense. after killing both her mother and the associate, shallan dropped the blade and fell into a state of intense shock. lin placed the shardblade in his strongbox and held shallan while singing ""sleep my baby dear"" to soothe her. though the blade naturally vanished, shallan began to associate it with her ""mother's soul,"" which she believed was held in the strongbox--an idea she clung to so firmly that the safe would visibly glow to shallan's eyes. in the months that followed, shallan began to repress her memories of her mother and these events. her disassociation with the shardblade and the truth of what had happened caused her bond with testament, her original cryptic, to fail, causing testament to become a deadeye. in order to protect his daughter, lin davar allowed rumors to spread that he had murdered his wife and her lover--a secret he would share with few before his own death. cutting the thorns[edit] ""“shallan longed to stay outside. here in the gardens, people didn't scream at each other. here there was peace.”-shallan at age 12"" after her mother's death, shallan did not speak for five months. at this time, helaran became involved with the skybreakers, which frequently kept him away from his family's estates. before leaving, helaran purchased a sheaf of fine drawing paper and a new set of charcoal pencils for shallan--along with a leather satchel--hoping to coax some life back into his sister, who had enjoyed drawing at an early age. all of the younger davar siblings had handled the death of their mother poorly, and helaran hoped that shallan would help to lift their spirits in his absence. lin confronted his eldest son, who had ordered a carriage prepared without his father's permission to leave. shallan watched as helaran drew a mysterious shardblade of his own and held it to his father's chest, naming the man a murderer. after threatening his father further and dismissing lin's attempt to explain the truth, shallan begged helaran to relent. amused that her first words after the incident would be to defend their father, helaran dismissed his blade. he explained again to shallan that he would have to leave, despite her objections, and promised that he would one day explain the reasons for his activities. after asking her to continue to practice her drawing and threatening to keep an eye on lin, he left--prompting their father to destroy several pieces of furniture in an uncontrollable rage which lessened only after returning his gaze to shallan. for the next year and a half, helaran came only sporadically, always avoiding his father. during a particularly long absence, they received word from him only once through a brief letter--containing little aside from veiled threats for lin--along with a book for shallan written by jasnah kholin. lin davar's anger only grew as he would occasionally turn his violence towards the servants. shallan practiced her artistic skill with the help of a drawing book by dandos the oilsworn, often using art as a diversion from the family's struggles. shallan's other siblings continued to fare poorly, with balat mistreating animals and starting fires and jushu given over to drunkenness and gambling. the house was also facing economic shortfalls--a truth shallan discovered as she began assisting with the family's accounts. in spite of this, lin davar frequently insisted on throwing elaborate feasts, whereupon he would flaunt his alleged wealth to impress their lower-dahn guests. given a new dress for each occasion, shallan became part of this elaborate display as well. at one such feast around late 1169, with the tavinar family in attendance, lin davar announced his recent betrothal to malise gevelmar. after uncomfortable, prompted applause from his guests and family, a disgruntled lin distributed gifts to his children--fine daggers for his sons and an aluminum necklace for shallan. the feast was suddenly interrupted by redin, bastard son of highprince valam, come to investigate the rumors of murder. lin denied the rumors and requested that further discussion be held in private. while waiting, shallan told jokes to her brothers, prompting laughs, smiles, and their first genuine interaction with one another in quite some time. after additional encouragement from shallan, balat complained that simple optimism will not solve their problems. however, he later thanked shallan for the light she seemed to bring them. speaking loudly so as to be heard by the children, redin declared his need for a testimony against lin davar in order to convict the man. balat considered answering this summons before fear led to hesitation. wikim encouraged shallan to speak out, noting that their father will not harm her. however, shallan claimed that she could not remember what had happened, while internally denying that anything had happened at all. after earning no response from the children, redin reiterated that a witness was welcome to come forward at any time. at the demands of lin, redin then departed. ""“you can't fix us, shallan. jushu will destroy himself. it's only a matter of time. balat is becoming father, step by step. malise spends one night in two weeping. father will kill her one of these days, like he did mother.”-wikim to shallan at the middlefest fair"" determined to continue bringing hope to her brothers, shallan began seeking ways to encourage each of them to take steps away from their vices and towards more positive activities. at the middlefest fair of 1170 shallan put several of these plans into action after seizing an opportunity to leave her father's side when lin and malise began discussing the terms of a one-sided trade deal with brightlord revilar. accompanied by a guard, jix, shallan sought out eylita tavinar and then delivered a message from her to balat in the festival's gambling pavilion. shallan revealed to balat that she had seen the two eyeing one another and so had organized an opportunity for the two to meet and walk together. with balat on his way to meet eylita, shallan returned to find her father concluding a meeting with an unfamiliar messenger who came with news from helaran. the man gave a start of surprise upon seeing shallan and then dumped a powdery substance into his own cup before departing. when shallan prodded for the news, lin declared helaran to be officially disinherited and named nan balat his heir. he then asked shallan to speak with wikim, who had refused to leave the family's carriage. shallan took this opportunity to leave again and found wikim where he had been left. after discussing the family's battered state with wikim, shallan proffered several sheets of math problems related to highstorm timing calculations, which she had taken from her father's books and translated into glyphs. seeing through her intent, wikim belittled her efforts, but he could later be seen working the problems attentively and with a smile. leaving the carriage feeling dejected, shallan crossed paths with helaran's messenger. the man, who she later meets again as elhokar's wit, shared what little news he had of helaran: that shallan's brother was in good health, ""doing things he finds very important,"" and keeping an eye on their father. he then began to ask pointed questions of shallan, suggesting that he was aware of her family's brokenness and shallan's surgebinding abilities. after sharing a story about two blind men contemplating beauty, hoid asked shallan to indulge him with her own definition of beauty. with some prompting, shallan began to describe an idyllic scene of her family--all present, including her mother and eldest brother--in their gardens, interacting with one another in love and joy. as she spoke, hoid held out a handful of infused spheres, which shallan subconsciously used to lightweave the scene described. realizing what she was doing, shallan withdrew her abilities. hoid encouraged her, suggesting that their struggles are partially caused by an unmade or some other supernatural force. apparently satisfied with what he had discovered of her abilities, hoid then bowed, disclosed that helaran was currently in alethkar, and left. ""“keep cutting at those thorns, strong one, and make a path for the light. the things you fight aren't completely natural.”-hoid to shallan at the middlefest fair"" the strain between lin davar and his household came to a head later that year, when jushu's gambling debts climbed higher than he could manage. shallan, now fourteen years old, was joking with balat and wikim in the family gardens when the three heard the arrival of a carriage. as they rose to investigate, wikim gave shallan a small pouch of blackbane leaves he had been intending to use and thanked her for her enheartening efforts. they arrived at the manor house to discover jushu bound, his creditors demanding repayment from the boy's father. refusing to pay his son's debts, lin relinquished jushu and hardened himself to shallan's pleas. after repeatedly petitioning her father to change his mind, lin davar came to the decision that he had been too soft for the last several years. grabbing shallan firmly by the arm, he sent her to her room without further question. determined to do what she could regardless, shallan asked balat and wikim for their daggers and chased after jushu. she begged for her brother's life, using both emotional appeals and logical arguments to convince the men to trade jushu to her in exchange for the fine daggers. shallan's sense of victory soon vanished, however. upon returning to her room, shallan's father arrived, behind him lying the bloody, crumpled body of a serving maid. resolved not to harm his own daughter, lin coldly explained that his anger was beyond his control and that future disobedience from shallan would result in others being punished in her place. the brightlord's assertions that he has plans to make something great of house davar suggest that these events coincided with the onset of lin davar's involvement with the ghostbloods. ""“i've done this for you, and you will obey. i've gone wrong, somewhere, in letting you learn to question me. there will be changes in this house. no more weakness. i've found a way ...”-lin davar to shallan"" the perfect daughter[edit] in the months that followed, shallan became very quiet and submissive, avoiding her father when possible by confining herself to her room most of the time, her only act of rebellion taking the form of private jokes about her father's visitors when in the company of her siblings. the family's fortunes began to improve, though it did not restore kindness to lin davar as shallan hoped it would. in mid-1172, lin confronted balat over his relationship with eylita tavinar, with whom marriage would provide no political advantages. when the argument became heated, balat crossed the line of naming his father a murderer, and lin commanded his guards to put down the boy's new axehound pups, an order they swiftly executed. before leaving, balat revealed that helaran had returned. shallan followed to inquire further about his conversation with their brother, and balat explained that this would likely be helaran's final visit for a very long time. balat proposes that they flee, confessing that he will do anything necessary to be with eylita. shallan convinced balat that he should take wikim and jushu as well, though explained that she would not be able to join them. shallan then returned to the manor and overheard her father give the command to have helaran assassinated. before she could react, the voice of malise spoke up, criticizing lin for going too far. shallan fled to her room as the argument escalated and an enraged lin attacked his wife. ""“he'll kill us all. one by one, he'll break us and kill us. there's a darkness inside of him. i've seen it, behind his eyes. a beast ...”-malise to shallan after being beaten"" a couple of hours later, strengthened by encouragement from a book by jasnah kholin, shallan went to balat and asked him to flee with malise as well. news of the order to assassinate helaran urged him to take action, and the two conspirators began to discuss a way for them to leave and seek help before being caught. upon returning to the house, shallan entered her father's sitting room to tend to the wounded malise, her first time in the room since the day of her mother's death. as shallan began to clean and bind her stepmother's wounds the woman bitterly questioned why lin hates everyone besides his daughter. shallan then explained her plans made with balat, dismissing malise's concerns, before departing. shallan and balat set their plans into motion during the final weeks of 1172, just prior to shallan's seventeenth weeping. helaran seemed to have disappeared, having been killed by kaladin just several weeks prior. balat decided to continue with the plan, however, by seeking refuge in highprince valam and redin's promise made years before. they began to discuss what to do with malise when wikim suddenly appeared with the news that eylita had arrived, unscheduled. the siblings sought out eylita and their father in the feast hall, where lin davar revealed that he was aware of balat's plans to leave and that he had news that helaran had died on a battlefield in alethkar. shallan, while passing by the kitchens on a separate task, then discovered the lifeless body of malise. realizing that her father was beyond saving, shallan prepared a glass of wine and poisoned it with the blackbane leaves she had received from wikim years before. as shallan worked, balat and lin drew swords. the duel was short and ended with balat unarmed on one knee. mocking his son, lin paused to drink shallan's proffered wine. balat took the distraction to grab his sword and thrust at his father, but he narrowly missed. furious, lin seized an iron poker from beside the fire and began to beat balat's leg mercilessly. after several blows, eylita placed herself in the way. after a brief pause, lin began to swing at the girl before suddenly slumping to the ground--the poison had done its work. shallan commanded eylita to bind balat's wound while explaining what she had done with the blackbane leaves. as jushu pulled a mysterious soulcaster from his father's pocket, lin began to stir and they realized that the poison had only worked to temporarily paralyze the man. before he could recover, shallan looped her necklace around her father's neck and twisted it tight, whispering ""sleep my baby dear"" as he suffocated. the plan[edit] though house davar was effectively wealthy at the time of lin's death, the man had extended himself with aggressive business deals, which the davar children were unable to make good on. their finances had depended heavily upon the use of a secret soulcaster to create a stream of steady income by means of marble deposits ""discovered"" on their lands. during the fight that ended in lin's death, balat accidentally damaged the soulcaster. they took the soulcaster to a jeweler to have it superficially repaired, but their father's adviser who was trained to use the fabrial, a ghostbloods member named luesh, claimed that it still would not work. with their source of income gone and their father unable to reassure creditors, the family's financial state was in peril. the siblings considered their options and determined that the only means by which they could settle their debts was with a working soulcaster. unable to repair the device in secret, shallan devised a plan to become the ward of jasnah kholin--ostensibly a heretic with a soulcaster of her own--and covertly exchange the fabrials. the request to jasnah was written in desperation, but when the princess replied shallan and her brothers believed that the plan was worth the risk. shallan was to meet jasnah in dumadari in two weeks' time, however, jasnah's constant travels left shallan chasing the woman for nearly six months. for most of this journey, shallan traveled with captain tozbek, a longtime business partner of the davar family, who offered a generous discount, aboard the wind's pleasure. shallan finally caught up with jasnah kholin in the city of kharbranth. kharbranth (1173)[edit] petitioning jasnah kholin[edit] upon arriving in kharbranth in shash 1173, shallan now seventeen years old, captain tozbek checked with the dock registrar to confirm that jasnah kholin was still in the city. he explained to shallan that, as a princess, jasnah would certainly be staying in the conclave at the top of the city. tozbek assigned one of his men, yalb, to escort shallan, and promised to deliver her belongings if she proved successful with jasnah. yalb hired a rickshaw porter for shallan and served as a translator as they took the direct route from the docks to the conclave. shallan took in the exotic sights of the unfamiliar city as yalb translated the porter's commentary. upon reaching their destination the porter attempted to overcharge shallan, but yalb explained the truth. shallan paid yalb handsomely for his help and asked him to remain outside the conclave in the event she needed him further. once inside, shallan sought the assistance of a master-servant, who located jasnah kholin and led shallan to the woman. shallan joined jasnah as she accompanied king taravangian to the site of a recent cave-in that had trapped his granddaughter. though jasnah was impressed by her tenacity, shallan soon realized that jasnah's request to meet was merely an opportunity for her to petition the woman rather than a tentative acceptance. jasnah began to evaluate shallan's educational background and, with a few exceptions, found it to be sorely lacking in several subjects. upon reaching the cave-in, their conversation was put on hold. jasnah kholin used her soulcaster to transform the fallen boulder into smoke, freeing those trapped on the other side and gaining taravangian's leave to make use of the palanaeum. wasting no time, jasnah denied shallan's request for wardship and made her way to the city's famed library. determined not to return home without trying every avenue, shallan decided to make a second attempt to convince jasnah to take her on. she followed after jasnah to the palanaeum and, finding the 1000 sapphire broam cost of entry well beyond her means, sought out jasnah's alcove in the veil. after reaching the alcove, shallan took a moment to draw sketches of kharbranth and yalb to clear her mind. after a third sketch, of jasnah soulcasting the boulder, shallan drafted a letter that she hoped would change jasnah's mind. before she could place the letter and leave, she was interrupted by a young ardent, kabsal. after admiring shallan's artwork, kabsal explained that he had been attempting for some time to meet with jasnah and convert her back to vorinism. kabsal left shortly before jasnah's arrival. shallan was swiftly dismissed, after being berated by jasnah for wasting her time, but as shallan composed herself outside the alcove, a servant invited her back in to collect the spheres she had left. jasnah kholin apologized for her anger and sour mood and, at shallan's prompting, read the letter which had been overlooked. impressed by shallan's arguments and the revelation that she was self-trained, jasnah gave shallan the unique opportunity to request wardship a second time, after improving her deficiencies in history and philosophy. thanking jasnah, but realizing her house would be destitute by the time she could do so, shallan departed. ""“you can tell much about a person by what they carry with them. if that notebook is any indication, you pursue scholarship in your free time for its own sake. that is encouraging.”-jasnah deciding to make shallan her ward"" upon leaving the conclave, shallan was surprised to discover yalb still waiting outside, gambling with a group of city guards. yalb attempted to cheer shallan up as they made their way toward the docks after she had explained her failure with jasnah, and he eventually convinced her to make one final attempt to win jasnah's acceptance. yalb sought out a bookstore and shallan went inside, searching for books by some of the authors jasnah had listed. the thaylen book merchant, artmyrn, and his wife were somewhat taken aback by the young lighteyed girl's requests and attempted to sell her a romance novel instead. after a series of biting remarks from shallan, they eventually provided her with some of the works she had requested. finding the cost much higher than expected, but unskilled in haggling, shallan began to pay when yalb suddenly burst into the room pretending to work as the servant of one of artmyrn's competitors. with yalb's help, shallan was able to reduce the price significantly before making her purchase and returning to the conclave. shallan gave yalb the sketch she had made of him in thanks and returned to the palanaeum where she rented the alcove adjacent to jasnah's. she settled herself with her new books, planning to study as much as possible before jasnah's departure from kharbranth. jasnah, who had bribed the servants to report if shallan returned, appeared a moment later, surprising shallan. she guessed at shallan's new plan and, knowing something of house davar's precarious situation, explained she understood the source of shallan's urgency. jasnah then requested to see her satchel, sifting through the contents before beginning to study shallan's sketchbook. impressed by shallan's natural curiosity and inclination to scholarship, as expressed in her drawings, jasnah finally decided to grant shallan's request for wardship. she wrote home the next morning via spanreed, letting her brothers know that she had succeeded in the first step of their plan to steal jasnah's soulcaster. a scholar's mantle[edit] shallan was provided a simple room within jasnah's quarters in the kharbranthian conclave. she was given admittance to the palanaeum and trained to use the library's ubiquitous filing system. shallan greatly enjoyed her new position as jasnah's ward, dividing her work between her own education, assistance with jasnah's research, and occasionally some cherished time for her personal interests. though her education sometimes proved to be a tedious endeavor, shallan found the new lifestyle to be a refreshing experience. while she expected her wardship to be one of dull memorization and busy work, instead she found interest in her studies and encouragement from jasnah. the newfound freedom was a treasure and her self-confidence grew tremendously. after her father had placed tight restrictions on what and whom shallan was allowed to sketch, she now relished the opportunity to draw anyone who would permit it. shallan's talent quickly became the talk of the conclave, and as word spread, even king taravangian himself came to request a portrait from the young artist. while sketching the king, she accidentally added the forms of two cryptics standing behind the man. not understanding the significance of what she had drawn, shallan claimed she had made a mistake and started the sketch anew. this surprised jasnah, who had never known shallan to make such mistakes in their time together. though jasnah herself did not show much interest in shallan's artistic ability, she did see some value in it. on one occasion, she had shallan copy the purported image of a ""voidbringer"" while corresponding with dalinar. kabsal continued to visit periodically under the pretense of converting jasnah, though his romantic interest in shallan became apparent as he often arrived while jasnah was away. their friendship grew as the two would converse over bread and different varieties of jam--including shallan's favorite, simberry jam. shallan found herself in an awkward position, torn between kabsal's concern for her soul, as the ward of the infamous atheist, and jasnah's frank suspicion that kabsal was using shallan to steal her soulcaster. jasnah did not forbid their friendship, however, and shallan found great satisfaction in the young man's attention. shallan's true mission constantly loomed before her, however. as she worked to earn jasnah's trust, action would soon be demanded, and though jasnah certainly proved to be a difficult woman to please, she was far from the harsh apostate from whom shallan had imagined she would be stealing. after two months as jasnah's ward, shallan received word via spanreed from her brothers, who faced increasing pressure from their creditors. nan balat further confided that luesh had been found dead and that his associates were demanding the return of the soulcaster behind veiled threats. on top of the added urgency, this would require shallan to learn how to use the device in addition to stealing it. though she took great efforts to study jasnah's technique with the soulcaster, the woman used it sparingly where shallan could see. as shallan took greater care to observe jasnah, she also took a secret interest in the woman's private research. while the princess sometimes gave shallan work to do that was related, such as a scholarly investigation into the death of king gavilar, she never revealed the nature of her studies. shallan was, however, able to catch glimpses of the books that jasnah was reading. eventually, shallan went searching for a copy of one such book only to find that it was merely a collection of folktales and children's stories. ""“there will be times when you must make decisions that churn your stomach, shallan davar. i'll have you ready to make those decisions.”-jasnah kholin"" an opportunity to steal the soulcaster finally arrived soon after jasnah began using shallan as her bathing attendant. one evening, as the women conversed over the nature of gavilar's early interactions with the parshendi while jasnah soaked in her bath with eyes closed, shallan moved to swap their soulcasters. heart beating wildly, shallan froze up and found herself unable to make the exchange. as she glumly attended to jasnah while contemplating her weakness, the two began discussing the philosophy of morality. having decided that shallan's studies had been too academic of late, jasnah became suddenly inspired to teach shallan a hands-on philosophy lesson. she dressed and, despite the late hour, they made their way out of the palanaeum and into the city itself. they walked the ralinsa towards the theater district until coming to a dark side street which provided the most direct path. jasnah explained that several murders had happened along this street in the previous two months and that the city watch had done nothing. after defending their right to use the road safely, jasnah led them down the side street and revealed the gems of her soulcaster. four men with knives soon attacked, but as shallan screamed in panic jasnah swiftly soulcasted one man into fire, another into quartz, and the final two into smoke as they ran. they returned to the conclave on a palanquin. shallan, shocked and horrified by what jasnah had done, argued with her tutor over the ethics of the encounter. jasnah defended her actions and then tasked shallan with researching the various philosophies involved and building her own case on the matter. as shallan helped jasnah undress and prepare for bed, she suddenly spotted another opportunity to swap the soulcasters. galvanized by her disgust at what jasnah had done with the device, shallan checked that jasnah wasn't looking and performed the theft unnoticed. heart of a thief[edit] a few days later, shallan still found herself disturbed and confused by what she had witnessed. the experience drew out memories of the recent murder of her own father and forced her to confront her recent theft on behalf of her family, which only challenged her further. shallan also had a difficult time waiting to see whether jasnah would suspect her in the theft. nan balat contacted shallan once again, with more concerns for the house's finances and the men asking about the soulcaster. though he urged her to return soon, shallan explained that she could not leave until she had an opportunity to deflect jasnah's suspicions. though several days had passed, jasnah showed no signs that something was wrong, which left shallan unsure whether jasnah was even aware of the theft. this left her trapped in kharbranth, but it also gave shallan more opportunities to study the device's method of operation. she turned to the sketches of her memories of jasnah's ""philosophy lesson,"" but found no revelations as to how the soulcaster was made to work and was unable to make it transform anything when practicing in private. eventually, shallan completed her philosophy studies, deciding that jasnah's actions were ""both legal and right,"" but also immoral and unethical. after determining that shallan had studied the subject to her satisfaction, jasnah gave her the day off. shallan returned to her quarters to test the soulcaster further, having found a new reference the day. the tip, however, proved useless, and shallan's mind began to wander until she took to drawing. as she sketched the strata of the rocks on her ceiling she heard a voice suddenly whisper, ""what are you?"" startled, shallan investigated the source of the voice and found a maid in the sitting room. after realizing the maid had entered jasnah's room (despite requests that no maid enter), shallan sent the woman to apologize to jasnah and took the opportunity to look through jasnah's notes herself. though she hoped to find some reference concerning the use of the soulcaster, shallan instead found several notebooks of jasnah's research into the voidbringers and the knights radiant. as she wondered why jasnah would be so interested in such myths, a knock at the door forced her to abandon the espionage abruptly. the new visitor was kabsal, bearing jam and bread, which they took to the conclave gardens to enjoy. over the course of their conversation, kabsal began hinting more outwardly of his growing affection toward shallan, even suggesting that he would leave the ardentia to be with her. uncomfortable with the situation, shallan deflected the conversation towards jasnah and her skepticism of the ardent, which then gave her the opportunity to ask kabsal about the nature of soulcasters. kabsal unfortunately proved to have no personal experience or useful knowledge regarding the device. after kabsal departed, shallan's thoughts shifted toward the realization that she would need to leave kharbranth soon. saddened by the idea of her time as jasnah's ward reaching its end, she decided to return to the veil and spend the remainder of her free day studying. on her way, she received a letter from captain tozbek to inform her that they would arrive in the city in one week's time, placing a final deadline on her departure. shallan used her final days living the life of a young scholar. on the day prior to her departure, shallan made an observation about the nature of king gavilar's strange interest in the parshendi which sparked a conversation about how shallan's studies on the king related to jasnah's own research. though jasnah avoided explaining herself fully, the prospect of her own discoveries supporting jasnah's work excited shallan. realizing that her time was practically up, however, shallan asked some blunt and probing questions about urithiru, voidbringers, and the parshendi. when jasnah eventually refused to answer further questions for the time being, shallan found herself desperate to learn whatever she could in the time remaining. under the excuse of searching for a book about gavilar, she entered the palanaeum to research anything she could find about the voidbringers. she found little of substance after searching for two hours, however, and was discovered by kabsal just as she began to return. she asked him questions while obtaining the book she had originally come for, though kabsal knew little either. as they began to return to jasnah's alcove, shallan confessed to the ardent that she would be leaving the following day--giving the excuse of urgent family matters. kabsal offered to come with her, but shallan refused him a final time. wounded, kabsal asked for a sketch of himself before she departed, and shallan suddenly realized that she had never drawn one of him during her time in kharbranth. they hurried back to the veil, and shallan set to drawing the young man through tears. kabsal then insisted that she draw a second image of them together in exchange for payment. shallan used a mirror to capture a memory of the pair of them and began to sketch while filled with feelings of guilt and anxiety. as she wrestled with these emotions, shallan once again accidentally sketched the form of a cryptic, standing behind kabsal. crushed by the weight of her circumstances and concerned for her mental state, shallan declared that she had made a mistake and dashed from the balcony seeking privacy. as she took the lift down to the main level shallan took another memory of the landing above. upon quickly sketching the scene, two of the symbol-headed figures stood above, watching her. shallan fled to her quarters as quickly as possible, pausing for one more moment along the way to draw another sketch, this time with five of the creatures following her. she hid in her room, huddled on the bed with doors locked, as she began yet another sketch of her surroundings which revealed a group of the cryptics surrounding her, one of them reaching out as if to touch her. despite her promises to herself not to use the blade ever since her mother's death, shallan began to summon her secret shardblade out of pure terror. she was interrupted then by a voice, asking, ""what are you?"" with her response, ""i'm terrified,"" the room around her crashed into beads and shallan found herself in shadesmar for the first time. though only there for a moment, she accidentally managed to soulcast the crystal goblet beside her bed into blood. assuming that the transformation was related to the device she carried in her safepouch, shallan was shocked out of fear momentarily and began to ponder what she had done. jasnah, however, had followed quickly and began knocking on shallan's door. out of concern that jasnah would discover the blood and realize shallan had the soulcaster, she took a shard of glass that was broken in the accident and cut a gash in her own wrist. as jasnah entered the room, shallan slipped into unconsciousness. questions and answers[edit] shallan spent two days in the hospital under the constant eye of the nurses, who suspected that the incident had been a suicide attempt. shallan had time while she rested to consider what had happened, but as she pondered she only found more questions. after a brief visit from king taravangian, jasnah and kabsal were finally permitted to see shallan. jasnah apologized deeply for the pressure she had placed on shallan, assuming that she had overworked her ward, and gave shallan a copy of the book of endless pages as a gift. kabsal entered a moment later with a gift of strawberry jam, and shallan insisted that jasnah stay and share the bread. as they spoke, shallan's plans to leave were revealed to jasnah, who assumed it was also related to the pressure she had placed on her student. as they began to eat the bread, kabsal began to insist emphatically that shallan try the jam. when she took the jar for herself, however, she found that it had a vile odor and was unwilling to try it. kabsal took some for himself anyways, desperate to get it down, before stumbling away and collapsing. shallan leaped from her bed after him but found that she was dizzy herself. she fell as jasnah called for a garnet for her soulcaster for use in healing shallan. believing that jasnah would be unable to help her with the swapped, broken soulcaster, shallan revealed the stolen soulcaster from her pouch before passing out. ""“she'd lost it all. no fabrial to protect her family, no wardship to continue her studies. no kabsal. she'd never actually had him in the first place.”-shallan after her theft was revealed"" she awoke alone in a quiet room and her memories slowly began to settle. a single man guarded the entrance to her new room and reported to jasnah when shallan woke. jasnah arrived and explained that kabsal--now dead--had poisoned the bread in order to assassinate jasnah and that she had saved shallan's life by soulcasting the poison from her blood. the theft now revealed, jasnah questioned shallan's motives before accepting the truth shallan provided. jasnah revealed kabsal's conspiracy and death, chided shallan for her actions, and explained that she had arranged passage for shallan to return home the following day before leaving without further response. left alone, shallan slowly processed her thoughts and heavy emotions concerning the theft, kabsal, and her time in kharbranth. as she considered the poisoned bread and examined sketches of her memories, several holes in jasnah's explanation began to surface. why had the antidote failed? why had jasnah not been poisoned? paired with her own experience soulcasting without the apparent aid of the soulcaster, the answer eventually became clear to shallan: jasnah could soulcast without the use of a fabrial. she left the hospital, during the night and still wearing her gown, and made her way to jasnah's alcove in the veil. the princess threatened to call the guards but hesitated as shallan began to explain what she had uncovered. though at first jasnah began to explain shallan's arguments away, a sketch of shallan's look into shadesmar gave the woman pause. as final proof, shallan reached out to pattern (whose existence was still a vague memory) and spoke a deep truth--that of her murder of her father--which enabled her to visit shadesmar once more. shallan crashed into the sea of dark glass beads and began to slip beneath the surface before jasnah suddenly appeared as well and pulled shallan back from the other realm. ""“i want to know, jasnah. i want to be your ward in truth. whatever the source of this thing you can do, i can do it too. i want you to train me and let me be part of your work.”-shallan petitioning jasnah to reaccept her"" though shallan's betrayal had cut deep, jasnah found herself unable to pass up the opportunity to teach and train a new, young surgebinder. under heavy conditions and promises, jasnah reaccepted shallan as her ward and began to share the truth of her soulcasting abilities, the deeper secrets of her research into the voidbringers. after studying jasnah's notes, shallan agreed with her conclusions that the parshmen were, in fact, mankind's ancient enemies. she also learned of the urgency of jasnah's research upon being told of the ghostbloods--an organization that shallan now realized her father had been dealing with. though concerns for her family's situation weighed upon her, shallan determined that assisting jasnah was of greater importance. with the palanaeum resources exhausted and assassins at jasnah's heels, the pair began making plans to travel to the shattered plains. journey to the shattered plains (1173)[edit] the wind's pleasure[edit] ""“power is an illusion of perception... on an individual basis, in most interactions, this thing we call power-authority-exists only as it is perceived... i can create that illusion for them, as can you.”-jasnah to shallan, aboard the wind's pleasure"" jasnah and shallan took passage towards the shattered plains aboard the wind's pleasure. several days into the journey, as they sailed through longbrow's straits, shallan was sketching from her memory of shadesmar while on the ship's deck when she noticed a new cryptic, pattern. as she considered the strange sight, the crew began calling attention to a santhid which was spotted following the ship. desiring to sketch the nearly mythological creature, shallan attempted to have captain tozbek stop the ship, but the man refused her requests leaving shallan deflated. jasnah emerged from her cabin shortly afterward and, seeing that shallan was distracted by her visit to the strange realm of shadesmar, explained the basic nature of the cognitive realm and spren to satiate shallan's curiosity. when shallan expressed concern for her brothers' situation, jasnah explained that she had taken some actions to alleviate their problems. she had corresponded earlier in the day with her mother, navani kholin, making plans both to repair the broken soulcaster and to establish a causal betrothal between shallan and adolin kholin. this would solve the davars' financial problems and satiate the ghostbloods while also tying shallan closer to jasnah. humbled by jasnah's opinion of her potential, their conversation turned towards shallan's self-doubt, to which jasnah explained that power and influence are often nothing more than an illusion. encouraged and emboldened by jasnah, shallan commanded tozbek to stop the ship and lower her into the sea, where she was able to capture a memory of the santhid for later sketching. pattern appeared again a few days later as shallan was studying in her cabin. by taking a memory and sketching the spren she was seemingly able to help cement his presence in the physical realm. jasnah appeared at her door a moment later and the women discussed the nature of their nahel bonds and the spren associated with the knights radiant, including the cryptics. jasnah then charged shallan with devoting her full time to the study of pattern over the next several days. pattern's intelligence and understanding seemed to be increasing notably as shallan observed and conversed with him, though the crew took his presence as a bad omen. in one instance, as pattern recalled his earliest memory, shallan began to instinctively lightweave--but it lasted only briefly once she realized the memories that it was unearthing. one evening, after a long but satisfying day of study, shallan visited jasnah's cabin to borrow infused spheres for light. she found jasnah in an exhausted, troubled state which left a strong impression on shallan--both of jasnah's humanity and of the importance and urgency of their task. upon hearing shallan's desire to help bear the weight of their task, jasnah explained more of what she understood about the voidbringers and the desolations. she also gave shallan the requested spheres and explained the importance of stormlight, along with what little she knew of shallan's ability to lightweave. she also gave shallan a copy of words of radiance to study the knights radiant further. shallan then retired to her room but slept only for a while before she was awoken by shouts and smoke. shallan quickly surmised that the ship was under attack. upon peeking out of her cabin she saw several men throw jasnah's body to the floor and stab her in the chest. the men spotted shallan who retreated into her room, leaving her trapped. as the men began to break through her door, shallan was able to conjure a basic lightweaving of a form dashing from the room and out onto the deck. the men chased, giving shallan time to move to jasnah's room. with the crew captured and no other means of escape shallan entered shadesmar and managed to soulcast the entire ship into water. shallan lost consciousness as she sank into the dark, icy ocean. tradesman tvlakv[edit] presumably having been rescued by the santhid, shallan awoke to find herself on a rock near the shore of the frostlands. the fate of the crew uncertain, shallan made her way to the beach and traced a glyphward prayer before searching for other survivors. as she began to wonder how she would survive the night, pattern spotted a chest which turned out to be jasnah's--containing all of the woman's notes and research as well as a wealth of infused spheres. with night drawing near and stormlight at her disposal, shallan attempted to soulcast a stick into fire, but amid her own exhaustion and inexperience, she was unable to overcome the stick's stubborn will. refusing to give up, shallan began walking further along the beach long after the sun had set. she eventually noticed a campfire in the darkness. too cold and tired to think clearly, shallan approached the fire, laid down, and fell asleep. she was roused in the morning to learn that she had wandered into the camp of the slave merchant tvlakv. though the party was eager to move on without her, shallan exerted her rank and made promises of payment in order to convince tvlakv to escort her to the shattered plains. they retrieved jasnah's chest and then set off, shallan riding a wagon along with one of tvlakv's mercenaries, bluth. shallan sought to distract herself as the weight of her loss--everything from jasnah to her sketchpad--slowly settled, though bluth proved to be a poor conversation partner. after tvlakv called a halt at midday, shallan acquired the key for the cage on bluth's wagon so that she might use the vehicle as a carriage. with a place to be in private, shallan examined the contents of jasnah's trunk and discussed with pattern the reason for his coming and the need to continue jasnah's research. ""“you live lies. it gives you strength. but the truth . . . without speaking truths you will not be able to grow, shallan. i know this somehow.”-pattern to shallan"" several days later, as the group was settling into camp for the evening, shallan used pattern to spy on tvlakv and his other mercenary, tag. unsettled by their plans to hold her hostage in exchange for payment, shallan approached tvlakv to reiterate her promised payment and hint that she was aware of his schemes. punctuating their exchange with a subtle lightweaving, shallan turned and headed back towards her carriage as bluth returned from scouting the area with a call to put out the fire. he reported bandits in the vicinity, prompting the group to pack up their things and travel further through the night. as they continued riding the following day, shallan began a new sketchbook with drawings of the santhid, local plant life, and bluth in order to ease her nervousness. the bandits were spotted following, but eventually, they found smoke in the distance ahead of them. shallan pushed tvlakv into approaching this new caravan, again making use of her lightweaving abilities, and they set off once more. shallan soon moved from her seat beside bluth to the interior of her makeshift carriage for some privacy. she examined her feet, which she had treated with knobweed sap earlier in the day, to discover they were far more healed than they should be. in speaking with pattern about her lightweaving, which she had begun to realize she was unconsciously doing, shallan learned how to breathe in stormlight and determined that it was causing her feet to heal. they spoke further about the nature of shallan's oaths and pattern's belief that she would eventually kill him. shallan emerged from the carriage just as they moved near enough to determine that the caravan ahead was under attack. as they approached the sunset, they encountered tyn--the head of the new caravan's guard--who explained that the bandits who attacked them were still nearby. as this group began to attack again, shallan turned with bluth to confront the bandits following behind. finding these men to be deserters from the shattered plains, shallan appealed to their sense of honor and made promises of forgiven debts and pardons. she succeeded in convincing them, again with a lightweaving to aid her, and these men charged off to join the battle. they proved victorious, but not without cost. shallan found bluth dead, among dozens of his comrades. he was however clutching the sketch shallan had drawn of him earlier in the day, indicating that bluth was inspired by shallan's sketch to uphold a sense of honor that bluth originally assumed he had abandoned, resulting in a surprising amount of dead bandits surrounding bluth's body in the aftermath of the battle. it is assumed that the inspiration of honor from shallan's sketch inspired bluth to risk everything, including his own life, for the chance of becoming the person he saw as himself in shallan's sketch. shallan then spoke with the caravan's owner, macob, and they agreed to accompany one another to the warcamps at the shattered plains. shallan then seized tvlakv's slaves, claiming them as payment in exchange for saving his life. she purchased his wagons as well, despite his protests which were stifled by shallan's tentative ownership of her own new band of mercenaries. tyn's apprentice[edit] shallan easily earned the respect of most of her new mercenaries, including gaz and red, but struggled with the threatening pessimism of the band's leader, vathah, who was vocal in his doubt that she would keep her promises to them. on the fourth day of travel after the attack, shallan was invited to dine with tyn. they ate in private as tyn revealed her belief that shallan was actually another woman assuming the identity of ""shallan davar"" in order to pull off a scam. though shallan tried to convince tyn of the truth at first, she eventually relented and invited tyn to be part of a pretend scheme to blackmail dalinar kholin. tyn took the younger shallan under her wing and began teaching several skills, including acting and forgery, that would be useful to the girl she believed was a young, inexperienced con artist. several days later, while the two women were practicing various accents, their caravan encountered four men on horseback. tyn ordered macob to halt, deciding that she and shallan would confront the men alone in order to give shallan a chance to practice some of the techniques they had spoken of. prodded by tyn, shallan assumed the role of a horneater princess as the men, including kaladin and some members of bridge four, approached. as kaladin began to question them, shallan began to tease the captain and ultimately demanded his boots in payment for a feigned offense. two days later, just shy of the warcamps, shallan had the caravan pause for a break as they passed a lait. she found a quiet place and took time to think and relax as she sketched, despite brief disturbances by gaz and vathah. as she moved from drawing the local plant life, shallan drew two strange images--one of a woman kneeling over a broken statue and one of the crew of the wind's pleasure on a rocky beach. tyn eventually interrupted and shallan finally revealed that her supposed scheme was to assume the role of adolin kholin's betrothed. as she considered everything she would have to balance when arriving at the shattered plains--her actual betrothal along with tyn's plans, all amidst jasnah's research--she grew anxious but also excited. ""“difficult things. yes. i believe i told you. i've learned that lesson already. thank you.”-shallan's final words to tyn."" the following day, the caravan finally reached the outskirts of the alethi warcamps at the shattered plains. however, with a highstorm approaching at night and the sun soon setting, tyn and shallan decided to spend one last night in camp. as they waited for confirmation from macob, tyn revealed that her king, hanavanar, along with six veden highprinces had been murdered recently by the assassin in white, prompting a succession war. she invited shallan, secretly concerned for her brothers, to attend her later during a meeting with an informant via spanreed so that they could inquire for more information. shallan later waited out the highstorm in her carriage--throughout which pattern acted particularly strange and nervous--before joining tyn. as they met with the informant, shallan learned that her own family's own highprince, valam, was preparing to assault vedenar itself--if he wasn't secretly dead already due to poor health. frustratingly, this gave her little insight into her brothers' situation. the informant continued with information on the deserters shallan had recruited. to shallan's dismay, tyn insisted that they should turn the men over in exchange for a reward. her resistance prompted a firm lecture from tyn, which left shallan distracted by how to handle the situation. a new message soon came with news regarding the presumed death of jasnah kholin. as shallan began to realize that tyn was involved with the ghostbloods, additional information came through about jasnah's ward--shallan herself. tyn quickly realized the truth and attacked shallan. pattern was able to distract the woman for a short time by using jasnah's voice, but when she finally approached shallan with a sword drawn, shallan swiftly summoned pattern as a shardblade and pierced her through the chest. a moment later shallan's men poured into the room, having been warned by pattern, to find shallan with her shardblade and tyn dead on the ground. shallan swore them to silence and set them about searching through tyn's things. only then did shallan notice that the informant had continued writing with a request from the ghostbloods for a meeting in the warcamps. seeing an opportunity to discover how much the ghostbloods knew, shallan responded affirmatively. the shattered plains (1173)[edit] ""“shallan awoke as a new woman. she wasn't yet completely certain who that woman was, but she knew who that woman was not. she was not the same frightened girl who had suffered the storms of a broken home. she was not the same naive woman who had tried to steal from jasnah kholin. she was not the same woman who had been deceived by kabsal and then tyn... during the trip with tvlakv, she'd pretended she could lead and take charge. she no longer felt the need to pretend. ”-shallan's thoughts the morning she entered the warcamps at the shattered plains"" a new woman[edit] the next morning shallan prepared herself to enter the warcamps using tyn's things. macob and his people departed their camp first, sending a palanquin back for shallan. followed by her guards and slaves, shallan intended to approach dalinar kholin, but they soon learned that all of the highprinces were in conference with king elhokar, as the assassin in white had attacked the previous evening. they proceeded to elhokar's palace, where shallan entered with vathah and gaz in attendance. at the entrance to the king's conference room, she was recognized by kaladin, who took her claim to be adolin kholin's betrothed with a great deal of skepticism after her act as a horneater princess three days prior. the sourness of their previous meeting led to a bitter exchange of insults and caused a scene before all the many guards of each highprince that were present. moments later the meeting of highprinces paused for a break, giving shallan an opportunity to enter and approach dalinar. she reported on the death of jasnah to the highprince and jasnah's mother and tried to explain the nature of jasnah's research before navani began pressing for more details about jasnah's murder. after navani excused herself, shallan garnered pardons for her guards, and then the discussion turned towards the betrothal as adolin approached and introduced himself. they found one another attractive and though the basis for the union appeared weakened with the loss of jasnah, dalinar and adolin agreed to maintain the causal for the time being. the meeting resumed, and shallan observed from the periphery, trying to piece together the current situation among the alethi--including the news about the assassin in white's attack and the nature of the strained relationship between dalinar kholin and torol sadeas. as the discussion concerning szeth continued, vamah noticed shallan standing in the back, and ialai sadeas began to question her concerning news of the assassin and the war in jah keved. shallan had nothing in the way of news to offer, but her connection to dalinar was made known and when several in the room appeared to see her as a political tool shallan used the opportunity to find housing and employment with turinad sebarial. eventually, the meeting reached its conclusion, and shallan joined sebarial for the ride back to his warcamp. though sebarial was not a particularly welcoming host, he kept his word, and once the pair reached sebarial's manor, his mistress, palona, proved far more amiable. she provided shallan with a comfortable set of rooms and answered all of shallan's questions before shallan sank into her bed and fell into a heavy sleep. the ghostbloods[edit] upon waking, shallan found tyn's spanreed flashing. she responded to tyn's messenger, successfully imitating the woman, and learned that the ghostbloods desired to meet within the hour. unable to delay the meeting, shallan explained that she--tyn--was wounded and that her apprentice would appear for the meeting instead. shallan practiced her lightweaving as she waited for the meeting to be coordinated, inventing a false identity to use as tyn's supposed apprentice--a false identity she would soon come to name ""veil."" with everything organized and her identity covered by an illusion, shallan snuck out of her room and into the night. shallan eventually located the building she had been directed to in sebarial's camp. the guard at the entrance allowed her to enter and then led her down into a basement and through a trapdoor. in the stately room below, shallan met mraize and an audience of silent onlookers, including masked iyatil. though disappointed not to see tyn herself, mraize decided to spare ""veil's"" life, intrigued by her boldness. he asked shallan, whom he calls ""little knife,"" to have tyn infiltrate brightlord amaram's palace in search of ""hidden secrets."" shallan then left the hideout and returned home, using a lightweaving along the way to elude a pursuing iyatil. ""“that was, she thought, the most ridiculous thing i've ever done. and yet she found herself excited, flushed with the thrill of it. storms! she'd enjoyed that. the tension, the sweat, the talking her way out of being killed, even the chase at the end. what was wrong with her? ... i'm not that girl anymore, shallan thought, smiling and staring at the ceiling. i haven't been for weeks now.”-after shallan's first meeting with the ghostbloods"" six days after the meeting with the ghostbloods, shallan used her increasing skill with lightweaving to sneak into amaram's manor. disguised first as a messenger boy and then as one of the maids, telesh, she sought out the room that she suspected held amaram's secrets. inside, she found detailed maps of the shattered plains covered with stormwarden script. additional notes revealed that amaram was studying the same things that interested jasnah--and that he was working to return the voidbringers. short on time, shallan captured memories of the documents before leaving the room. she covered her tracks on the way out, tying the loose ends of the lies used to enter the manor. leaving the camp as the messenger boy, she informed amaram that shallan davar wished to make sketches of his shardblade. at this he summoned the blade, revealing it to be helaran's and leading shallan to believe that amaram must be responsible for her elder brother's death. the following afternoon, after adolin's duel with elit, shallan traveled by carriage as veil to the appointed meeting place outside of the warcamps in the unclaimed hills. after a short hike, she reached a pavilion where several ghostbloods, including mraize, awaited her. believing tyn to have failed in her assigned mission, mraized was taken by surprise when shallan produced multiple sketches of what she had seen in amaram's room, though some detail had been secretly withheld. mraize deduced that shallan must have entered the room herself, but was disbelieving when she claimed to have produced the sketches from memory. he tested her then by having her draw one of his associates, jin, on the spot. shallan's success impressed mraize thoroughly and he began to probe her motivations, which led to his realization that shallan had killed tyn. he assured her that this would not damage her credibility with the ghostbloods as tyn was not a member, and then told shallan to await instructions concerning a new task. upon leaving, shallan grew concerned that someone might follow her again, so she lightwove a boulder to hide inside of. she had pattern command the carriage driver to head back into the warcamps, using her voice to deceive the man into thinking she had slipped in quietly. the ghostbloods eventually passed, but shallan continued waiting until here stormlight ran out. along her long walk back to the warcamps, shallan passed the burning wreckage of the carriage and the corpse of the coachman, reinforcing fears that she was in more danger than she realized. a note from mraize eventually came approximately two weeks later, directing her to seek further instructions at a specific time and location. shallan arrived early, hoping to catch the delivery of these instructions, but after a long wait with no arrivals, she began to wonder if the ghostbloods were attempting to watch her in turn. she had pattern search the windows of the tenement she waited on and was able to trick a spying iyatil into revealing herself. the masked woman explained that the instructions provided were supposed to be carried out immediately so that the ghostbloods could watch veil at work. when shallan pressed, she explained that her task was to investigate a strange madman who had arrived in the warcamps under the custody of one of dalinar kholin's most trusted footmen. determined to impress the ghostbloods, shallan invited iyatil to join her on the task. the women rode a palanquin to the temple complex in dalinar's warcamps, where shallan simply used her own identity to gain entrance while iyatil was distracted. they reached the building where the man--none other than the herald talenel--was being kept, along with other mentally ill patients. shallan then convinced the ardents that iyatil was possessed by a voidbringer, giving her a distraction to slip through unnoticed as well as a mean to escape from iyatil's observation, and snuck into taln's dimly lit room. though the crazed man reacted minimally at first, constantly reciting his repetitive speech about his nature and purpose, an attempt to surgebind by shallan caused him to snap into a brief intense lucidity in which he seemed to recognize her as a knight radiant. dazed after drawing her shardblade in fear, shallan was unable to leave before meridas amaram arrived with bordin to question the man himself. shallan hid behind a lightweaving as the brightlord asked questions of the man without success, revealing to shallan that he believed the words of the herald to be true. after the two new arrivals departed, shallan returned to iyatil with information about taln's rambling speech and the arrival of amaram. later that evening she delivered a full report via spanreed. upon receipt, mraize welcomed shallan as a full member of the ghostbloods. adolin kholin's betrothed[edit] a few days after arriving in the shattered plains, shallan visited the kholin practice grounds as adolin practiced under the watchful eyes of kaladin and his guards. shallan used their brief interaction to casually plan a walk with adolin the following day, which in turn opened the door to a date at a winehouse of adolin's choosing. they used this time to get to know one another on a personal level, and seemed to connect well despite--or perhaps because of--shallan's unorthodox conversation topics. shallan also took the opportunity to question adolin about the chasmfiends. convincing him that the alethi and parshendi may be hunting them to extinction, she asked him to speak with dalinar about the possibility of traveling with the army to see a chrysalis for herself. after adolin confided in her the details of their betrayal by sadeas, shallan explained the research into the voidbringers that jasnah had been working on, and asked for help in smoothing over the relationship with navani. after the approaching highstorm was spotted, the two remained until the final seconds before the stormwall reached them before retreating into the shelter and making plans to speak again later. the two met again after adolin's duel with elit, where shallan began to devise a plan to help adolin corner sadeas himself in a duel. there they made plans for another date the following day. when adolin and kaladin arrived at sebarial's manor to pick her up, shallan recognized wit, acting as the coachman, to the man who comforted her at the middlefest fair three years prior. she thanked and hugged him before joining adolin in the carriage, where they decided to visit a menagerie in the outer market. as they rode, shallan shared more details about her plan regarding sadeas--telling of the highprince's own use of the right of challenge and the king's boon to corner brightlord yenev into a duel. she handed over further details in a letter to navani, blushing as adolin praised her plan and thanked her. they soon reached the menagerie and enjoyed their time there--shallan sketching animals and explaining what she knew of them while adolin made jokes. shallan attended adolin's fully disadvantaged duel the next day. she berated herself for not realizing the trap adolin had walked into--intrigue she would be responsible for recognizing, as adolin's wife. as her betrothed struggled in the dueling arena, shallan briefly considered joining the fight herself, before writing off the idea as foolishness. feeling wrong to interfere with adolin's own fight, shallan sent pattern to distract the shardbearer facing renarin, which bought enough time for kaladin to enter the fight and tip the balance in favor of adolin. adolin's self-imprisonment after his victory gave the couple some time apart, though they continued to chat via spanreed on occasion. this freed shallan to continue her research and her efforts to contact her brothers, but it also allowed some doubts to creep in concerning the security of their relationship. though shallan was never particularly jealous, she struggled with fears that adolin was not as committed. scholar and radiant[edit] after settling in sebarial's warcamp, shallan was finally able to devote more time to the study and continuation of jasnah's research. while trying to discern the location of urithiru, she made her first breakthrough--the realization that jasnah was hoping to find an oathgate to the mythological city on the shattered plains. after infiltrating amaram's mansion, shallan used her findings there to focus her research. by comparing his map of the shattered plains with an ancient map of natanatan, she determined that the ruins of stormseat must be located on the plains. amaram's notes further confirmed the idea that oathgate in the ancient capital would provide a means to reach urithiru. as shallan dug deeper into these matters, pattern repeatedly tried to explain that she would need to confront her past--particularly the murder of her mother and the early memories of pattern--in order to become the radiant that she would need to be. pattern hoped that by confronting these truths she would remember skills long forgotten, but shallan continued to instinctually stifle those memories. instead, they continued practicing and learning anew her skills with lightweaving, including the ability to attach illusions to other objects and to suppress her glow when holding stormlight. scouting mission[edit] when dalinar began making plans for an expedition into the heart of the shattered plains, adolin was able to convince his father to allow shallan to accompany one of the scouting missions. the scouting mission set out on ishakach 1173 with shallan riding a palanquin--though she often ran ahead of her porters in order to sketch things that interested her. at one such stop, she managed to find evidence of the ancient structures she had expected to find. her eccentric excitement repeatedly put kaladin on edge, and after the bridgeman insulted adolin, shallan lashed out with her usual sarcastic banter, angering kaladin further. as shallan later explained her findings of the ruins to adolin while the pair crossed a chasm, an assassination attempt on dalinar suddenly unfurled. the bridge was sabotaged, and though adolin managed to save his father, shallan fell with the bridge into the chasm below. shallan did not wake until the sun began to set. the army above had apparently fled some attack from the parshendi, and the only other survivor of the fall proved to be kaladin stormblessed--whom shallan believed she must have somehow saved by accident. together they searched dead bodies for supplies and then began to speak of a plan. shallan had assumed that the kholins would return for them, and paled as kaladin convinced her this was unlikely. with a highstorm arriving in just one day, they set off on foot through the chasms. though glad not to be alone, shallan was easily irritated by the bridgeman's disposition, and her teasing to lighten the mood only served to irritate the man further. the tension grew into a shouting match, which soon attracted the attention of a chasmfiend. they ran, shallan relying on her supply of stormlight to keep up until shallan led them back around past the dead bodies at the site of the fallen bridge. finally safe from the distracted chasmfiend, shallan was thrilled to have an opportunity to capture a memory of the greatshell before they silently set off once more. they walked for a few hours before halting for the night. shallan sketched their path through the chasms while relaxing before sleep, which kaladin interpreted to mean they had veered in the wrong direction. ""“he saw it in her eyes. the anguish, the frustration. the terrible nothing that clawed inside and sought to smother her. she knew. it was there, inside. she had been broken. then she smiled. oh, storms. she smiled anyway. it was the single most beautiful thing he'd seen in his entire life.”-kaladin's thoughts on shallan's confession of a difficult past"" kaladin roused shallan early in the morning and they set off once more, hoping for the sun to give more help with their orientation. it didn't take long before they began to irritate one another once again, but as the conversation progressed, they slowly began opening up to one another. when kaladin admitted his suspicions of shallan, she shared jasnah's theories concerning the voidbringers and swore to him that she intended no harm to the kholins. unfortunately, the rising sun revealed that they were again headed in the wrong direction, so shallan set about drawing their path once again. they began relying on her sketches to make slow, steady progress through the chasms. the process helped her to realize that the shattered plains were symmetrical, which kaladin reinforced by explaining he had once seen them as symmetrical in a dream. with kaladin highly discouraged, shallan tried to be upbeat. he attributed this optimism to an easy upbringing and was shocked when shallan showed him a hint of the brokenness within herself. something about her honesty encouraged the bridgeman, and he actually began to join in with her joking--until the chasmfiend revealed itself once more. kaladin pushed shallan into a crack in the chasm wall, where they hid just out of reach until the monster relented and began to simply wait. with the highstorm only a few hours away, kaladin decided to run as a distraction--giving shallan an opportunity to escape with her important knowledge of jasnah's research and now the plains' symmetry. shallan allowed him to leave, but not before offering up pattern as a shardblade. she darted from the crevice after kaladin drew the chasmfiend's attention and was able to reach her satchel, containing what little stormlight she had left. as kaladin struggled to survive against the attacking beast, shallan used illusions of herself and kaladin to distract it and buy him precious moments. when the beast finally snapped at the true kaladin, he drove pattern deep into its head, slaying the creature. shallan rushed to his side to help free him from the dead monster's maw. with kaladin alive but too wounded to help, and the highstorm soon approaching, shallan used pattern to cut a series of handholds into the chasm wall above the chasmfiend's corpse, followed by a small cleft just above the waterline. she clambered into it herself and pulled kaladin in as the stormwall struck. terrified amidst the raging torrent, they clung to one another. kaladin mentioned his prior experience being strung up in a highstorm, and prompting from shallan encouraged him to share much of his personal story with her--though the truth of helaran's death was obscured by happenstance. shallan listened silently and shared her own childhood struggles and time with jasnah after he had finished, including the murder of her father. as her story came to a close, the stormfather appeared to shallan. then, with the height of the storm past, shallan fell asleep against kaladin. the pair recovered the gemheart from the chasmfiend the following morning and returned to the warcamps, tattered but alive, where they were brought to the triage pavilion for care. navani arrived shortly after and took fierce command of shallan's treatment as if the girl was her own daughter--ordering blankets, a warm bath, and a hot meal despite shallan's protests. though the older woman's sudden affection was overwhelming, shallan embraced it graciously. shallan had pattern spy on dalinar and navani as she bathed, revealing dalinar's hopes that shallan would join their expedition for the use of her mapmaking skills. adolin arrived soon after, relieved to discover that his betrothed was still alive. after a long hug and kiss, he swore to protect her more carefully, earning him a strong reprimand from shallan, with thoughts of her father in mind. when dalinar arrived with navani to request shallan's aid, shallan explained her theory that the ancient ruins of stormseat at the center of the shattered plains held answers to jasnah's research. she also explained the supposed danger posed by the parshmen and convinced dalinar to leave them in the warcamps. with shallan's decision set, navani decided to join as well, and the army was ready to march within the hour. narak[edit] shallan's lady's maid and guards joined as well, including gaz, who arrived at the last moment with a newly acquired copy of words of radiance. adolin gave shallan a placid horse, expecting she wouldn't ride for long with little experience on horseback, and the couple enjoyed one another's company as the army began to depart--though shallan felt a distracting and lingering sense of yearning for the unwavering intensity that she had seen in kaladin. the march to stormseat took several days, during which shallan spent much of her time studying words of radiance for clues that might be helpful in reaching urithiru. as the weeping began on the second day, navani joined shallan in the carriage and offered her apologies for how she had been treating shallan as well as assistance in shallan's research. thankful to have the older woman's support, and for navani's insistence that shallan would oversee the project, they began to collaborate. shallan explained jasnah's research and revealed that jasnah herself proved to be one of the knights radiant that dalinar had been hoping to unite. one week into the expedition, dalinar came to speak with shallan in private about these matters. seeing that the highprince was in great need of encouragement, shallan confided in him that she herself was a lightweaver--creating an illusion as proof. she swore dalinar to secrecy, for the time being, before they left together to investigate the report of a parshendi who had surrendered. the men of bridge four identified the parshendi as rlain, appearing to shallan as one of the voidbringers of legend as described in jasnah's notes. after speaking with dalinar, shallan interviewed rlain herself, and was able to work out a map to narak with his help--though he knew nothing of the oathgate--and a few days later they reached the outskirts of the city. with retreat no longer a viable option, dalinar charged shallan with seeking the oathgate at all costs, in case it became their only chance for survival. as the battle of narak commenced the following day, shallan was hard at work sketching the center of the plains in hopes of a clue, when one of the kholin scouts indicated that a portion of her map was incorrect. shallan instantly recognized that this strange plateau, breaking the symmetry of the shattered plains, would hold the oathgate. shallan quickly set out with renarin kholin, inadara, several bridgemen, and a squad of soldiers, to investigate. they skirted the ongoing battle to reach the plateau, and shallan soon located the entrance to the oathgate's control building, buried under centuries of crem. once inside, however, they struggled to understand how the ancient fabrial might be used. shallan identified the ""keyhole"" requiring a shardblade but did not understand why renarin's dead shardblade failed to activate it. she gave the order to gather the alethi armies on the oathgate plateau before continuing her efforts. eventually, amidst renarin's cryptic lament, shallan recognized that the device was a fabrial--requiring stormlight to be utilized. abandoning all hope of keeping her nature as a surgebinder a secret, shallan began collecting infused gemstones and transferring the stormlight to the oathgate's lamps. as the everstorm and unexpected highstorm collided above narak, shallan attempted to activate the oathgate once more with adolin's shardblade. when, again, nothing happened, shallan realized that the living shardblade of a knight radiant would be required. she removed adolin's blade, drew pattern, and transported the remaining alethi forces to urithiru. urithiru (1173-1174)[edit] brightness radiant[edit] on the eve of her arrival in urithiru, shallan was helping to explore the tower when she happened across a note--addressed to her and marked with the symbol of the ghostbloods. she entered the next room to find mraize, who had discovered her true identity--though he insisted that ""veil"" is shallan's true self. mraize reiterated both shallan's debt to the ghostbloods--her father's broken soulcaster--as well as her admittance into their ranks. shallan denounced him, noting their apparent murder of jasnah kholin, however, mraize claimed he would deliver her brothers to urithiru, teased secrets relating to helaran, and promised shallan that she would only find answers to all of her questions by working with the ghostbloods. exhausted after the long day and confrontation with mraize, shallan met with adolin, who led her to a room selected by pattern as a place for rest. the room instantly reminded shallan of her father's study, and once she entered pattern explained that she would have to confront the truth of her past in order to become the knight radiant that the world would need. he prompted her to relive the murder of her mother through a lightweaving; memories buried deep down and long-suppressed returned to shallan's consciousness--the weight of it crushing her, but deepening her bond to pattern. it was assumed at this time that pattern was the original cryptic shallan had bonded and that he had been pushed back into the cognitive realm and their bond weakened, when in reality shallan betrayed her radiant oaths and killed testament. ""“i don't want revenge. i want my family.”-shallan recalling her mother's death"" after reforming the knights radiant, dalinar asked shallan and renarin to learn as much about their newfound powers as they could; however, shallan had a lot more on her mind than just her new role as a knight radiant. following her confrontation with her past, shallan struggled to keep her mind from wandering to the murder of her parents, so she attempted to focus on drawing rather than the murder she had committed. as she practiced drawing urithiru, she found that her drawing was more of a surrealistic interpretation of the tower city rather than a realistic one. noticing her frustration, pattern assured shallan that it was okay for her to hate them for killing her parents; however, shallan assured pattern that she did not blame the spren but rather the way her life spiraled out of control and eventually led to her killing her parents. as the conversation between her and pattern lulled, a scout arrived to inform her that she had been requested to attend a meeting with dalinar, and his family was also in attendance. while making their way to the meeting, the scout asked shallan about what it meant to be a knight radiant and carry a shardblade. despite being a lightweaver, she pretended to be an elsecaller when in public in order to hide the fact that she could create illusions. shallan assured the scout that she would still be able to maintain her femininity whilst acting as a radiant, seemingly disappointing the scout. when shallan arrived at the meeting, dalinar hoped to glean some sort of information from her in order to understand more about the political world. unfortunately, shallan was unable to share the information dalinar was hoping for, disappointing the highprince. while the meeting went on, shallan constructed a three-dimensional projection of roshar out of stormlight with the aid of dalinar's own abilities. as the attendees at the meeting marveled at her creation, lyn returned to inform them that there had been a murder. when they arrive at the scene of the crime, the victim appeared to be vedekar perel, and they discover that the murder was an exact copy of the murder of highprince torol sadeas. when adolin is assigned to search for the perpetrator, shallan noticed that he had been acting strange and pattern hummed in response to adolin's strange behavior. afterward, shallan began to practice her illumination abilities in her room. she learned to better control her creations and could now cause them to move without the aid of pattern. as she was practicing, adolin arrived and they began to flirt with one another and eventually kissed until pattern interrupted them. while adolin and shallan continued to build their relationship, adolin urged shallan to learn to use a shardblade in order to better defend herself. shallan, however, could not bring herself to use the blade due to her past experience with the weapon, so she created a new personality, one she named brightness radiant, to take on while using the shardblade. noticing shallan's discomfort with the blade, pattern advised shallan to sever the bond and kill him, so she could forge a bond with a new spren and have a fresh start. shallan, however, quickly squashed the idea and focused on her training. as she continued practicing with the sharblade, shallan noticed the similarities between adolin and herself as they were both passionate about what they loved. as time passed, shallan began to feel that she could be herself around adolin and even briefly allowed herself to slip through her disguise as radiant so she could enjoy her time with the prince. veil's investigation[edit] later, shallan, as veil, decided she would head to the breakaway, the marketplace established in urithiru following the battle of narak, in order to search for any clues on the recent murders to aid adolin in his investigation. as she made her way to the markets, pattern expressed his fondness for adolin. while he initially disliked adolin because he carried a shardblade that was essentially the dead corpse of a spren, he came to understand that humans in the physical realm kill and destroy in order to survive. as the conversation began to lull, shallan brought up the previous conversation pattern initiated about her supposed hatred for him. pattern, again, urged shallan to sever their bond and kill him, so she would no longer have to deal with the discomfort she felt when wielding him as a shardblade. before the spren could finish, she quickly expressed her need for the spren and begged pattern not to leave her, telling him that she also hated herself but she did not want him to go. seemingly pleased with shallan's response, pattern dropped the conversation and hummed to himself. ""“there was a simple relief for shallan's pain. there was an easy way to hide. veil hadn't suffered as shallan had-and she was tough enough to handle that sort of thing anyway. becoming her was like setting down a terrible burden.”-shallan while changing into veil."" as veil arrived at the breakaway, she began eavesdropping on conversations between the people there in order to pick up on any information on the murders. after failing to learn anything relevant to her mission, she entered a bar set up in a large battle tent in hopes of learning more there. noticing that veil lacked the experience she posited herself to have, shallan hoped to increase her credibility as a darkeyed con artist while visiting the marketplace. while shallan primarily visited the marketplace in order to gain more information on the recent murders, she also used veil to become more knowledgeable about the darkeyed society established in the tower city. as shallan ignorantly ordered hard wine in the bar, jor, a bouncer attracted to her, made his way to her and began flirting with veil. observing that she was becoming increasingly drunk, jor offered to escort her out of the bar and call a palanquin to return to her room before it got too late. picking up on the opportunity to learn more about the murders, shallan asked what were the ""dangerous places"" she should look out for, so she did not get harmed. as he informed her that someone had been stabbed the previous night at all's alley, shallan collapsed on the floor and unconsciously sucked in stormlight to ease the pain she felt. she quickly discovered that she was no longer drunk. shocking the bouncer and barkeep, shallan calmly drank another cup of wine and began to make her way to the location jor informed her of. noticing that she had let veil slip while she was drunk, shallan berated herself for dropping the disguise and letting herself feel the pain of her past she was hoping to avoid. as pattern attempted to remind her that veil was just a disguise, shallan shared her fear that she may have killed her brothers and fabricated the memories she had with balat as she conversed with him over spanreed. worried over shallan's mental stability, pattern reassured her that her brothers were still alive and questioned if she could still differentiate between her lies. assuming her veil personality in order to hide from pattern's questions, shallan assured pattern that she could still tell. pattern, however, noticed that shallan was still lying and expressed his confusion over the reason she chose to assume her veil persona. veil simply replied by saying that she needed to go deeper with her disguise, making pattern even more anxious over the deliberate lies shallan continued to place over herself. as veil interned the all's alley, she ordered and drank horneater white, the strongest drink they had, impressing the others at the bar. hoping to prevent veil from becoming too drunk, the barkeep attempted to stop her from drinking any more of the alcohol, but veil stopped him and used that opportunity to ask about the murders, using the excuse that she was searching for the murderer that killed her little sister in the alethi warcamps. refusing to share any information on the murder, he directed veil to a group of thugs that might have the answers she was searching for. in order to learn more information about the murder, veil stabbed one of the thugs in the hand for pushing her out of his chair and threatened them by revealing her association with the ghostbloods. while interrogating them, betha, one of the thugs, revealed that a man named ned had strangled his wife to death. believing she had reached a dead end, veil began to make her way out of the bar. before she left, she overheard betha mention another murder that occurred in the markets while conversing with ur, the thug veil had just stabbed. as she returned to the thugs, betha quickly informed veil that a barmaid had also died a similar way, but ned vehemently denied any connection to the second murder before ur killed him for supposedly killing the barmaid. realizing that this was likely a double murder, veil was satisfied with the new information and left the tavern. a new job[edit] the next morning, shallan, still ill from the heavy drinking she did as veil, woke to the sound of adolin knocking on her door. after enjoying some light banter with the prince, she sucked in stormlight from a sphere he offered her to clear the hangover she suffered from. as she began to dress for the day, adolin informed her that he would be meeting with ialai sadeas, the widow of torol sadeas, in order to discuss any clues she might have on her late husband's murder. disturbed by ialai, adolin requested that shallan accompany him to his meeting with a woman. when adolin requested that she bring her own soldiers to accompany them meeting instead of his, shallan shared that she did not think she had any real use for the former deserters, and she did not find them necessary to follow them. after he explained to shallan that her soldiers would feel honored by being put to use, shallan relented and promised to find more tasks to assign to her guards. when they arrived at sades' section of urithiru, shallan found that mraize was also there, acting as one of ialai's soldiers. despite being surprised by his presence there, shallan and mraize both pretended not to know each other. when ialai dismissed shallan to fetch tea, she and the assassin discussed veil's actions with the thugs in the breakaway and the whereabouts of her family. while he did not reveal any important information on her family, he informed her that she must remove the ""darkness"" that is supposedly plaguing the city and that he would share some information on her now-deceased brother, helaran, in exchange. frustrated by mraize's teasing of her brother's name, shallan returned to the proper rooms where ialai revealed that she had assigned amaram to investigate sadeas' murder on his own due to her distrust of the kholin family. after the revelation, she and adolin returned to the hallway and discussed their dislike for the woman. as they began to leave sadeas' residence, a guard informed them that the highstorms have returned. while exploring the city of urithiru, shallan discovered a long-abandoned theater and put on a play for pattern using images from her sketchbook to conjure people to act it out. recalling a play she had seen as a child, shallan told the story known as the girl who looked up, a rosharan folk tale about a girl curious about an ancient wall surrounding her village to protect the people from ""bad things"". as shallan began to recall memories about her family and consumed too much stormlight for her illusions, she dropped the images she used to act out the play. while all of her illusions dispersed, she noticed a dark figure leave the theater. startled by the presence of the intruder, shallan transformed herself into radiant and chased after it. as she reached a dark chamber, she used her lightweaving abilities to create various versions of herself to illuminate the room. after they vanished, she found a dark form writhing and squeezing into a small slot leading into the marketplace. believing it to be some kind of spren, shallan transformed into veil and chased it into the market where she discovered that rock, a member of bridge four, had been stabbed in the hand by a strange man. veil quickly realized that rock was a horneater just like ur, the thug she had stabbed while visiting all's alley. after learning that there at been no new murders, veil came to the conclusion that whatever was copying the murders was also copying all the violence occurring in the city. as she was about to leave the market, ishnah, one of the thugs she previously encountered, requested to join the ghostbloods in order to learn more about the current events going on in roshar, but shallan refused. encounter with re-shephir[edit] as shallan attended another meeting led by dalinar, she drew an image of the spren she encountered while in the theater. pattern informed her that this was not a typical spren like he is but it was, instead, a spren of odium. bored by the political conversation, shallan drew an image of sadeas and discovered that his appearance was similar to that of brightlord perel, confirming her belief that the murderer was copying any violent acts performed in urithiru. while idly flipping through her drawings of the recent murder victims, malata, the dustbringer accompanying taravangian, attempted to make small talk with the lightweaver, but shallan found the conversation unpleasant due to her indifferent attitude and overfamiliarity when conversing with her. as she began to plan her next move in her search for the murderer, the room quieted as ialai sadeas and meridas amaram entered. while initially shocked by their sudden appearance, dalinar attempted to invite ialai to attend the meeting, but she quickly rejected his invitation and announced amaram's delegation as regent and heir to the title of house sadeas. after adolin insulted the highprince, dalinar asked his son to leave the room and shallan quickly followed. when she caught up with the young prince, he expressed his displeasure at ialai's announcement, and shallan unexpectedly shared her belief that amaram may have killed helaran. as she explained that the highprince possessed her brother's former shardblade, adolin reluctantly reminded her that amaram obtained the shardblade after kaladin killed a shardbearer. shocked by the news, shallan tucked her thoughts away and tried to move the conversation to another topic while they made their way to the bottom floors of the tower. while adolin went to visit the stables, shallan returned to her room and absentmindedly flipped through her sketchbooks to keep her mind busy. while flipping through the sketchbook, she found strange images she could not recall drawing. disturbed by the drawings, she shut her sketchbook and quickly left her room. later, she arrived in the common room of the barracks and informed her soldiers that she had a new job for them. ""“plan every battle as if you will inevitably retreat, but fight every battle like there is no backing down.”-adolin to shallan as she hesitated during her battle with re-shephir"" prowling through the breakaway markets, shallan, disguised as veil, became increasingly concerned by the strange spren that seemed to creep over the people in urithiru. despite being aware of their ignorance, she was frustrated by the common populace's lack of concern while the void creature inconspicuously observed them. shallan used her guards to try and search for any more clues about the recent murder, but they had not found any news at least in the four days since they began their investigation. while veil waited for a new murder, she made her way to her soldiers,gaz and red, both unaware of veil's true identity. also frustrated by the lack of new leads, the two soldiers grumbled about the lack of action and began to poke at veil's history. she lied by saying that shallan had picked her up and hired her as a soldier under her, which they seemed to accept. annoyed by their questioning, veil reminded them to keep watch of a murder similar to one that occurred recently. three nights ago, a player in an initially friendly game of cards hit another player in the head with a bottle, effectively killing the man. the perpetrator, later revealed to be one of ruthar's soldiers, had been executed via hanging in the market's central square. veil was sure that the spren would return to copy the murder by hitting another person with a bottle as well, so she had ordered her men to keep watch of a similar murder. as veil began to reflect on both the similarities and differences between her, shallan, and radiant, she was startled by a sudden scream in the market. following the sound of the scream, she encountered vathah, who informed her that the murder had actually been similar to the hanging of the executed soldier. as shallan chased after the murderer, she transformed into radiant in order to engage with the spren. realizing she would have to descend deeper into the tower city, she sent pattern to bring adolin along with additional soldiers as a backup. before adolin could arrive, she quickly removed veil's clothing and, unaware of what she was doing, cast an illusion of shallan over herself. realizing what she did, shallan began to panic as adolin arrived along with bridge four. after informing them of her encounter with the strange spren, she and the rest of the party found a room containing a pit where the creature was likely settling in. as they descended down the hole, they discovered a room covered with murals depicting all ten heralds and the almighty. immediately after they enter the room renarin informed them that glys, his spren, felt something unpleasant about the room. shallan agreed and mentioned that dalinar could not feel it but the two of them could. as shallan brought that to light, renarin was about to say something, when adolin returned to show shallan the decaying library he had found. as shallan began to mourn the loss of ancient knowledge, lyn and renarin alert the others as they found a large black mass settling in the hallway. while they gaped at the strange form, they realized that the murders have been the result of the unmade, re-shephir. in response to the intruders, the unmade created copies of bridge four in order to repel them from its domain. as shallan watched the creature, she had the vague impression that she was familiar with the unmade and knew why it was committing murders. while adolin and bridge four's attempted to drive the creatures back, shallan made her way closer to the spren despite adolin's insistence that she retreat. as the unmade continued to create increasingly distorted copies of the residents of urithiru, shallan used her illumination abilities to conjure a glowing radiant force consisting of copies of people she drew in her sketchbook, seemingly driving the unmade's creations back. making her way closer to the unmade, the black form began to back away and revealed a bowl-shaped room where the rest of its form resided in. realizing that she had a strange connection with re-shephir and that the midnight creatures were no longer intimidated by her light, shallan began to hesitate and asked adolin whether they should retreat or continue to fight the unmade. adolin responded by telling her to persist and fight as if there was no other option. at adolin's advice, shallan ordered bridge four and adolin to clear away for her to reach the central mass while renarin watched her back. using her illumination abilities, shallan conjured various versions of herself to take the brunt of the midnight creatures' attacks. while they distracted the unmade, she made her way into the dark mass and gingerly pressed herself into the unmade. as shallan connected with re-shephir, she learned that it was an ancient spren created by the splintering of a greater being. after being ordered to cause chaos, the unmade became interested in men and eventually found itself attracted to the violence they committed. clinging to the advice adolin had given her, shallan continued her attack on the unmade using stormlight. while she struck at the creature, she learned that it was scared of being trapped again as it had been by another lightweaver in the past. as shallan realized that the unmade was learning about her similarly to how she was delving into the mind of the creature, she began to back down out of fear despite convincing herself that she would continue to fight off the unmade. sympathizing with the creature, shallan removed herself from the dark mass and collapsed out of exhaustion from her battle with the unmade. as re-shephir forced itself out of the pit and fled, shallan told the rest of the group not to follow. while teft frowned at shallan's order not to follow the unmade, he assented and they discovered a large treasure of cut gemstones where the unmade had previously settled in. following the encounter with the unmade, palona began to pry shallan for information about her battle with re-shephir while they sat in sebarial's sitting room. as shallan explained the nature of the spren, she realized that she sympathized with the creature, noting that it killed simply to mimic human behavior and possibly better connect with them. palona urged shallan to search for the rest of the unmade to prevent them from escaping imprisonment as re-shephir did, but shallan explained that she did not feel as though the other unmade were imprisoned like her. while she continued to recover from her fight with the unmade, adolin barged into the room to inform shallan that someone had arrived to the tower. as adolin began to reassure her that it was good news, jasnah and several other people entered the room, much to shallan's surprise. jasnah's return[edit] after jasnah's arrival to urithiru, shallan remembered that she was radiant but also a scholar. resuming her scholarly nature, she hoped to discover how jasnah had survived the shipwreck during their journey to the shattered plains. after failing to find the princess, shallan made her way back to the pits where she battled re-shephir after making several inquiries. when she reunited with jasnah, the scholar quickly shared her thoughts on the fused gemstones discovered after the unmade's escape from the pit. jasnah shared that she and her mother speculated that the crystal pillar was actually a large fabrial. after discussing the moral implications of trapping spren in gemstones, jasnah ordered shallan to sketch images of the gemstone pillar, reminding shallan that she was still expected to carry out her duties as jasnah's ward. as jasnah revealed how she escaped from the ghostbloods by using her elsecaller abilities, she also confided to shallan about her concern over her lack of understanding about the desolation. as shallan was forced to become a scribe for jasnah during the meetings held by dalinar, she realized that she was not fond of resuming her duties as jasnah's ward. despite her displeasure at being ordered around once more, she did as she was asked. during the meeting, jasnah noticed shallan's inattentiveness and called for a short respite to talk with her ward. while proud of shallan's growing confidence, jasnah shared her concern over the secrets she seemed to be hiding from her. after shallan refused to share her work with the ghostbloods, jasnah told her that she would need to balance both her wardship and her duties as a radiant. finished with their discussion, they both return to the meeting. as shallan returned to the meeting, pattern informed her that the room held ""memories"". concerned by the new information, shallan informed jasnah of pattern's comments, and the latter advised her ward that she should listen to her spren as they often share useful information. after being dismissed by jasnah, shallan returned to her room where she discovered a letter from the ghostbloods revealing that helaran was a skybreaker acolyte. the skybreakers, led by the herald known as nale, received information that there was a potential radiant in the davar household from the lover of shallan's mother, another skybreaker acolyte. after noticing helaran's potential, nale recruited her brother and had him prove himself to be worthy of a spren bond by killing amaram, a member of the sons of honor. however, helaran would later be caught and killed by ""a member of amaram's army who was close to bonding a spren"". after reading the letter, pattern informed shallan that there were lies in the letter, but the new information was still enticing to her. shocked by the revelation, shallan disguised herself as veil and left to find vathah and the rest of her men in their barracks to keep her mind off the news. while veil shared her frustrations with shallan to her men, gaz and the other soldiers also shared their pride about being useful for their mistress. as she enjoyed the company of her men, she began to reflect on her relationship with the ghostbloods. while she was aware that she was likely being used as a mole for the organization, she needed to find a way to turn that around on the assassins. while discussing the usefulness of the soldiers, veil noticed a washwoman observing them nearby. recognizing the woman as ishnah, veil questioned the woman. she soon discovered that ishnah was once a spy and hoped to join the ghostbloods by proving herself. seeing this as an opportunity to learn more about being a spy, veil gave ishnah the option of teaching her men how to be spies in exchange for promising to see if she would be worthy to join the ghostbloods. while training under ishnah, vathah and the others are practicing how to do espionage. as isnah teaches them how to observe their surroundings, shallan realized she was late for her meeting and ran to the meeting, begrudgingly continuing her duties as a scribe. while bored with her duties as a scribe, shallan convinced herself to resume her wardship under jasnah. when renarin is being taunted by janala, shallan stood up for him, which he greatly appreciated. renarin and shallan discussed the nature of the fabrials that seemed to be, in actuality, one giant fabrial that ran throughout the tower city. as the two got closer, shallan realized her way out of her wardship after renarin told her that she should stand up to jasnah more or just not be around her anymore. to avoid jasnah, shallan hoped to leave urithiru by joining dalinar's mission to kholinar. she managed to convince elhokar to let her go and help him take back kholinar after offering herself and her spies to accompany the king, telling him that they are not dalinar's subjects and they could make their own decisions. while shallan left, she hummed along with pattern as she convinced herself that she was not running away from jasnah but rather going on the mission to kholinar for a good cause. siege of kholinar[edit] kaladin, two of his squires, elhokar, adolin, shallan, and her retinue arrived in kholinar in order to open the oathgate and defend the city from the fused. the group met at the shop of a tailor named yokska and learned that the queen had been acting erratic due to the supposed influence of a dark spren. due to the disruption of the entire chain of command, a new highmarshal of the wall guard assumed control, bringing some semblance of order to the city, and a strange group known as the cult of moments now ruled the city. while the conversation occurred, shallan, through random acts designed to embarrass and injure herself, learned that the spren in kholinar have taken a strange appearance. the king later tasked shallan, accompanied by kaladin, to send a letter to the queen with the use of her lightweaving abilities. before sneaking into the palace, shallan shared her veil persona with her retinue, much to their shock. inside the palace, veil discovered the royal guards were not acting like themselves and was soon stabbed by the captain when she demanded that she personally deliver elhokar's letter to the queen. when the guards moved to dispose of her body, veil pretended to be dead but slowly healed herself using stormlight. while playing dead, she noticed a strange black figure with glowing circles for eyes in a mirror that should have held her reflection. veil was deposited in a waste room holding several corpses and sneaked out of the palace using illumination to disguise herself. still in shock from her near murder, she sent pattern to retrieve kaladin so they could return to the safe house. after recovering from her experience in the palace, shallan and her companions regrouped in yokska's kitchen and discussed their next plan. tasked with finding a way to infiltrate the cult of moments, shallan, disguising herself as veil, scrounged for information. during her exploration of the city, veil encountered an urchin named grund that had been abandoned because of his physical disfigurement. in exchange for information, shallan gifted food to the boy and others willing to provide intel. as veil began to doubt her actions taken to provide for the poor citizens in kholinar, she encountered wit retelling the story of mishim. once finished, wit led veil to an inn and he complimented shallan on her skills with illumination. while talking, they discussed the meaning of power, eventually giving shallan the advice she needed to infiltrate the cult of moments. after this, he left her with the bill for the food he ate, much to her displeasure. through the information she gathered, shallan learned that a group known as the cult of moments, under the thrall of the unmade ashertmarn, guarded the oathgate, and that the only way to join their ranks was to bring food to their grand feasts after receiving an invitation. assuming the persona swiftspren, shallan attempted to attract the cult of moments through displays of illumination and philanthropy. eventually, she received an invitation from the cult of moments after a grand heist at a local mansion. ""“your other minds take over because they look so much more appealing. you’ll never control them until you’re confident in returning to the one who birthed them. until you accept being you.”-wit to shallan as she fell into despair"" despite her charitable actions, shallan unwittingly caused the death of grund after the boy was attacked by the grips, a group that had been stealing the food given to him. following the murder of the urchin, shallan was scarred by the experience and was left revisiting traumatic memories from her past. in an attempt to ease the pain, she shifted through several personas using illumination in an attempt to search for a personality that could repair the damage she had habitually caused. she soon came to the conclusion that the past actions she took to aid others only left things worse in her wake. huddled in muri's abode, shallan encountered wit. through his retelling of the girl who looked up, wit advised her not to regret her actions and to accept herself if she wished to take control of her personas. shallan later regrouped with her companions, and kaladin soon arrived with highmarshal azure and her army. while discussing their findings, kholinar was attacked by the voidbringers and the enthralled soldiers of the city. shallan, accompanied by adolin, searched for the lingering presence of two of the unmade at the oathgate platform. on their way to the control building for the ancient fabrial, an undulating black mass blocked their path to the entrance. after finding her shardblade could not destroy the mass, shallan touched it as she did with re-shephir. inside the mass, she was overwhelmed by ashertmarn's voice as it attempted to convince her to engage in sensual self-indulgence. when shallan was inundated by the various personalities she had created in the past, she heard wit's voice in her mind and was advised to take control of them rather than fear them. as she felt herself nearly being consumed, the black mass soon evaporated and adolin proclaimed that shallan had defeated the unmade, despite her feeling as if she had failed. as she entered the building, shallan saw the black figure she observed previously when infiltrating the royal palace, and it identified itself as sja-anat. the unmade claimed they were not shallan's enemy and warned her not to operate the oathgate, as it was compelled to corrupt the spren of the platform so it would not function properly. after elhokar was seemingly murdered by moash, shallan and her group were overwhelmed by enemy forces. at the urging of adolin, shallan began to activate the oathgate platform. unsure of what to do, shallan asked pattern whether they should trust sja-anat, but the spren was unable to discern whether the unmade was lying or not. sja-anat insisted that shallan should not use the fabrial but noticed that she still did not trust it, so the unmade promised that they would refrain from killing them all while traveling through the oathgate. in order to avoid being attacked by the deranged cultists, shallan utilized the fabrial to transport azure, adolin, kaladin, and herself along with their spren. when they awakened, they found themselves in shadesmar, and azure grunted about her dislike for the strange realm. journey through shadesmar[edit] while in shadesmar, shallan and kaladin found themselves accompanied by their now fully-sized spren as well as maya, the dead spren tied to adolin's shardblade. syl pointed out that the spren represented the oathgate on the platform they stood on were corrupted and shallan came to the conclusion that this was due to sja-anat, but the unmade managed to keep its promise not to kill them despite their current predicament. stranded on an island and surrounded by the hostile denizens of the cognitive realm, the group was unsure of what to do. azure, being the one most familiar with navigating the strange realm, explained that shadesmar was the inverse of the physical realm, so they would need to travel to what would be the nearest body of water in their world in order to find land in the cognitive realm. because kaladin's abilities drew in too much stormlight and attracted the hostile spren, shallan had to use her abilities to maneuver through the world. pattern explained that soulcasting would not work the same way in the shadesmar. she instead discovered that she can read the impressions of the objects in each sphere that surrounds them and shape the surrounding spheres into various structures based on that impression. shallan used the soul of the oathgate control room to shape various copies of the building, and they slowly made their way to land. while traveling, pattern pointed out that the flames representing the souls of their companions on the other side were no longer going out as quickly as when they first entered, so some may have surrendered. shallan and her party soon arrived at the next piece of land and recovered after their hardships. now faced with the dilemma of having a lack of supplies, the group struggled with what to do next. azure explained that lightspren were known to act as guides for humans traveling through shadesmar, so they should try to locate them and travel to the nearest spren city where they could trade stormlight for supplies. a corrupted spren appeared in shadesmar and, in the voice of sja-anat, warned shallan that odium sent some of his minions to shadesmar in search of them, and he was growing suspicious of the unmade. due to shallan's previous misdirections, he believed that she was an elsecaller rather than a lightweaver. the spren soon left after shallan's companions attempted to attack it. they eventually settled at a lighthouse where they met riino, the lightkeeper. shallan felt useless due to her inability to scout the area as kaladin did in his initial exploration of the lighthouse. veil was still broken from her experience with grund, so she was unable to sneak through the building. however, the other personality was beginning to return as shallan discovered she could not draw with her usual skill and instead produced drawings reminiscent of veil's style. shallan mulled over wit's words and pondered over how she could keep her personas in check, but she failed to come up with a solution. while the others discussed where they would go next, a ship without a sail soon arrived at the lighthouse. as the group boarded the ship helmed by the reachers, shallan continued drawing during their voyage to celebrant. at the urging of syl, kaladin conversed with shallan and they discussed their attempts at dealing with their past. he complimented her ability to ignore her past trauma, but she remarked that it was not a good skill to have despite his admiration of her. when kaladin tried to continue their conversation, she became unresponsive as she no longer wanted to think about it. the group soon arrived at celebrant and they agreed to split up to prepare for their voyage to either thaylen city where they hoped to somehow activate the oathgate from the cognitive realm or the horneater peaks where they could travel to the physical realm using cultivation's perpendicularity. shallan, pattern, and azure were tasked to find passage for the journey. using pattern as a translator, shallan learned that no ship was sailing towards thaylen city or the horneater peaks as voidspren accompanied by the fused sailed warships near there and demanded tribute from those hoping to sail there. they then approach a stone-like spren that was sailing east towards freelight. just as shallan and azure found a ship that could take them, the fused caused a commotion and set captain ico's ship on fire. they learned that voidspren have recently appeared in shadesmar and seized control of the city. patten overheard the fused speaking and translated what he heard to shallan and azure. they discovered that the fused were seeking out radiants bonded to an honorspren and inkspren, the latter due to them thinking that shallan was an elsecaller. because of this, shallan used illumination to disguise azure, pattern, and herself as lightspren to avoid attention from their pursuers. shallan and her companions regrouped and they discovered that they are being pursued by both the fused and a group of honorspren seeking to capture syl. as the ship heading towards freelight sailed away, syl attracted the attention of some honorspren beginning to leave the city and they quickly captured syl while shallan and her allies boarded the ship. aboard the honorsprens' ship, shallan and kaladin devised a plan to escape as they neared thaylen city. while they discussed their strategy, they witnessed azure establish a deal with the honorspren-she would receive passage on their ship after reaching lasting integrity in exchange for details about her blade. kaladin, infuriated by azure's betrayal, stalked away while shallan began to prepare for their plan over the next few days. after getting permission from captain notum, shallan practiced visualizing objects from the beads she obtained from the sea, so she could construct structures to aid them in their escape. while practicing, veil continuously bled into her conscience, and shallan found herself struggling to maintain control over her personalities. seeing shallan in distress, adolin approached her, and she explained the various personas she created to protect shallan from being broken any further. in return for her honesty, adolin confessed to murdering sadeas. shallan comforted adolin and remarked that she did not think negatively of him and actually agreed with his decision to kill the late highprince. relieved by her response, adolin assured her that he was content with the ""real"" shallan that she shared with him and did not think less of her either. when kaladin was later surrounded by windspren, a rarity in shadesmar, shallan was bemused that she wanted to draw the scene kaladin unintentionally created. just as everyone on the ship was enamored of the display, eight of the fused were discovered near the ship. after notum released syl, shallan and her companions jumped off the ship and into the sea of beads while azure stayed behind to help the honorspren fend off the fused. using a bit of the stormlight she carried, shallan created a room underneath the beads so her group could breathe. they stayed within the space for a short amount of time, allowing the ship and the fused to pass, before resurfacing. the group was unable to find syl, but pattern reassured them that spren did not need to breathe so they were most likely safe. they soon made their way towards a patch of land where they found syl safe and sound. the honorspren reported that the fused were gone, so it was safe for them to continue moving. no longer in danger, kaladin lashed the rest of the group, and they began to fly towards the island of thaylenah where they hoped to access the oathgate and return to the physical realm. in order to preserve stormlight, they hike the rest of their trek to thaylenah and continue without breaks at the insistence of kaladin. using shallan's mapmaking skills, they soon arrive at thaylen city and see its oathgate platform in the distance. there, they witness the uncorrupted, gargantuan form of the spren of the oathgate and thousands of the voidpsren surrounding their only avenue of escape. half a dozen of the fused and a mass of red light soon appeared to guard the control building. shallan and her friends remained unsure of what to do as they were clearly outnumbered and lacked enough stormlight to defend themselves and activate the oathgate. kaladin insisted that shallan should create illusions and rushed to the oathgate platform while he fended off the remaining enemies. as odium summoned the mass of red light to possess amaram's army in the physical realm, they were left with only six of the fused, so kaladin initiated his plan. on her way to the oathgate platform, shallan lightweaved several figures from her sketchbook to accompany adolin and their spren as they drew the attention of the remaining fused kaladin was unable to distract. she then rushed to complete her task of activating the oathgate and attempted to convince the oathgate spren to allow them to travel to the physical realm. they informed that they were unable to accept her request as honor ordered them to prevent travel between the two realms using the oathgate before his death. when adolin failed to distract the fused, one of them charged at shallan and she somehow managed to manifest the physical form of a bead she carried that held the mind of a wall. pattern and adolin, wounded from one of the fused, returned to shallan, and they soon realized that they were running out of stormlight. desperate, they jumped into the sea of beads and regrouped with syl and kaladin, who was also out of stormlight. as kaladin failed to say the fourth ideal necessary to protect his friends, they began to lose hope. in the physical realm, dalinar temporarily ascended and summoned honor's perpendicularity, giving shallan and her friends an opportunity to leave shadesmar. battle of thaylen field and aftermath[edit] with the arrival of shallan and her group, dalinar noted that he sensed the presence of all the orders of the knight radiants on the field despite there only being nine individuals standing with him. because odium had withdrawn from the battle, they were now confident that they could fight against the remnants of his army. using the renewed stormlight dalinar summoned, they were each assigned a task to complete on the battlefield. shallan is ordered to use her lightweaving abilities to summon an army that would attract the voidbringers while the rest of them completed their tasks. despite losing her original sketchbook, shallan managed to summon every single person she ever sketched in her lifetime, patten noting that this was likely due to dalinar momentarily bringing the three realms together. when she felt herself weakening, she created veil and radiant to aid her as she created more illusions. in order to maintain the attention of the enthralled soldiers, shallan crafted realistic deaths for her illusions to satisfy the thrill of her enemies. while her illusions were successful, she felt as if a part of her was being destroyed as each one of them was killed by the soldiers. as shallan nearly consumed all the renewed gemstones, lift appeared to her asking for help. at lift's request, shallan used illumination to transform a rock into a ruby, so lift and szeth could fool the fused hoping to escape with the gemstone. shallan, veil, and radiant began to falter as more of the fused destroyed their illusions. when she began to run out of stormlight, jasnah appeared and soulcasted the air into a wall of flames to protect her ward. as they used that diversion to run away, jasnah gave shallan some tips for soulcasting. she mused that shallan may have actually soulcasted her illusions to give them weight or it may have been due to their high concentration of stormlight. they soon arrived at navani's camp, and shallan used that opportunity to recover while the scribes received updates from urithiru. during her period of switching between shallan, veil, and radiant, shallan confessed to pattern that she thought she might be better than she was before. while veil surveyed the area, pattern noted the appearance of enemy reinforcements carrying ladders from their ships. when they attempted another assault on the city, the thrill seemingly vanished and the remaining enemies retreat back to their ships. due to lift's and szeth's actions, they managed to capture the unmade neragoul within the ruby gemstone, effectively severing the last thing empowering their enemies. seeing shallan was exhausted from the battle, jasnah and navani attempted to get her a palanquin to recover. during periods of switching between herself and her personalities, shallan experienced an identity crisis, unable to determine which version of her was really herself. when adolin approached shallan, he immediately realized that shallan was not acting like herself. noting his concern, shallan reclaimed her core personality and assuaged his worries. after he left, shallan's personalities began to bicker about their relationship with both kaladin and adolin, and she quickly suppressed her other personas. following the battle, shallan and adolin relaxed and conversed about the recent events. when he noticed her glancing at kaladin, adolin confronted shallan about her apparent interest in the other man and offered to end their relationship so she could pursue one with kaladin. shallan assured adolin that she loved him and confessed that veil does have an interest in kaladin. despite this, she promised that neither she nor her other personalities would go after kaladin. shallan later attended a meeting with dalinar and his generals. during the meeting, they discussed options for ending their war with the parshmen without conflict and the possibility of there being a traitor in their midst. when dalinar brought up adolin's coronation, adolin, at the urging of shallan, hesitantly confessed to his murder of sadeas. he rejected his appointment as king of kholinar, and shallan convinced them to appoint jasnah as queen. a week later, shallan and adolin marry with veil and radiant by her side. her brothers arrived in urithiru, bringing with them a note from mraize. the note stated that shallan had fulfilled a portion of her debt to the ghostbloods by defeating re-shephir and they would need her to convince sja-anat to serve them.[expand] the war continues (1174-1175)[edit] during the year following the battle of thaylen city, shallan spends her time building the lightweaver order of radiants and doing spy work for the ghostbloods. in particular, she infiltrates the sons of honour, headed by ialai sadeas.[expand] she leads the other lightweavers in a group known as the unseen court, who call her master lightweaver. shallan is able to spend the majority of the time in a ""balance"" between herself and her two personas. she claims that she is able to remain stable with radiant and veil to help, but she senses that there are other personas that may come to the surface if the current system proves inadequate. those around her, including veil and radiant, are worried for shallan, and her mental health, wondering how best to help her. this comes to a peak when traveling through shadesmar with adolin to talk to the honour spren. shallan was sent by the ghostbloods to kill the leader of the sons of honor, who turned out to be the herald kelek. this was her final test to truly join the ghostbloods. shallan initially attempts to retreat when being forced to face her deteriorating health, but with the help of adolin, shallan emerges more often. that is until shallan learns that there is a spy in contact with mraize, shallan rapidly deteriorates when she discovers the perpetrator in pattern, and formless takes over and suppresses veil and radiant.formless decides to complete the mission to join the ghostbloods and goes to kill kelek. pattern, feeling remorseful for his accidental collaboration with mraize, works to get shallan to emerge, and he helps her remember her first spren, testament. shallan reintegrates with veil, as she remembers her memories and trauma associated with testament. after adolin's trial with the honour spren, she talks to kelek and learns about the greater cosmere, and is able to break away from the ghostbloods.[expand] relationships[edit] house davar[edit] shallan grew up as the only daughter in a minor noble family. after first manifesting her surgebinding abilities, her mother and her lover attempted to kill her, forcing shallan to fatally wound her mother out of self-defense. while her brothers were unaware of shallan's part in the death of her mother, her father was aware that his daughter killed her. shallan's father, lin davar, took responsibility for the murder of shallan's mother, showing that he did care for his daughter. after dealing with public scrutiny and the slow decline of his family, lin davar became an abusive father and would often beat his sons and servants, even blaming shallan for his actions. fed up with her father's abuse, shallan and her brothers arranged his death and eventually successfully murdered their own father. while shallan had a poor relationship with her parents, she seemed to have a close relationship with all four of her brothers. out of all of them, she seemed to be closest to her eldest sibling, helaran. helaran was shown to constantly bring gifts for shallan and even visited the house despite his poor relationship with his father. when she was informed of her brother's visits, shallan would often look forward to his company and the gifts he would bring for her. after learning about the death of helaran, shallan became extremely depressed and even resented his murderer until she became aware of the identity of the dark-eyed soldier responsible for his death. while not as close with her other brother, balat, shallan deeply cares for him and was shown to often communicate with him despite his disturbing fixation with killing small animals. shallan was shown to be the only one to care for her other brother, jushu, when he suffered from his gambling addiction, even going as far as to sell her soulcasted necklace and convince her brothers to give up their daggers to pay off his debt. while this did not pay all of his debt, shallan convinced the debt collectors to let him go by sharing that he comforted her when her mother died. after this, the two siblings became much closer to one another. wikim, the twin brother of jushu, was often the target of their father's abuse and shallan would often comfort him during his periods of depression. she was shown to be able to cheer him up by gifting him with sheets of mathematics. despite not being too close to wikim, shallan still cares for her brother. despite her miserable childhood, shallan maintained an amicable personality until she was forced to confront her past. it is likely that the confrontation of her past experiences with her family, namely her parents, has forced her to create multiple personalities to deal with the emotional trauma she dealt with as a child. pattern[edit] pattern, a cryptic, is shallan's steadfast companion and second bonded nahel spren. it is unclear when exactly shallan bonded pattern, though it had to have happened after shallan had killed her mother at the earliest. initially, he is unable to talk and has a weak connection to the physical world. as their bond solidified and shallan spoke more truths to pattern, pattern grew in intelligence and developed the ability to affect the physical realm. in addition to this, pattern is now capable of becoming a fully formed shardblade which shallan uses against enemies such as tyn. shallan initially expressed anger and even disgust towards the shardblade, as she then believed it to be the same one as the shardblade she used to kill her mother, made of the cryptic testament. after reflecting on the situation, and using the blade multiple times to save her and others' lives, shallan slowly dropped all hostility towards the shardblade. despite shallan's reassurance that she bears no ill will towards pattern, the spren is adamant about his belief that shallan wants to kill him. he justifies this as an act of revenge born from shallan's belief that he was the shardblade used to kill her mother, though in actuality this was likely due to her deadeyeing her previous bonded cryptic, testament. since then, pattern helps shallan confront the lies she tells herself, helping her grow as a person and as a knight radiant. he regularly advises her, answers her questions, and helps her with espionage by allowing illusions to be attached to him and be maneuvered elsewhere. testament[edit] shallan knew this spren when she was younger, yet had not given her the name of testament. instead, she called her pattern. it wasn't until her second journey into shadesmar that she remembered that her current spren, pattern, is not the cryptic from her childhood. she then recovers this spren from her youth, and names her testament. testament is the spren whose shardblade shallan used to kill her mother. after killing her mother, shallan unbonded testament, making testament a deadeye. adolin kholin[edit] adolin kholin was causally betrothed to shallan after jasnah proposed marriage between the two adolescents to secure the stability shallan needed for her family. she accepted the offer, hoping to use his power to save her family. they meet on the shattered plains and shallan is immediately smitten by his looks. as they spent more and more time with one another, shallan was able to become comfortable around adolin, sharing her true self with him. after shallan revealed herself to be a knight radiant, he teaches her how to fight with a shardblade. the two have shown a profound amount of trust for one another as seen when they both exchange their deepest, darkest secrets with one another. while shallan was initially hesitant to share her mental disorder with adolin, she later opened up to the prince in order to grow closer to him. shallan revealed to adolin that she struggles with her identities due to her dark childhood, and adolin shared his part in the murder of highprince torol sadeas in return. after the battle of thaylen field, their betrothal is finalized and they are married by the vorin church. jasnah kholin[edit] jasnah kholin is shallan's tutor. initially reluctant to take on shallan as a ward, she eventually gave in after shallan's persistence. although shallan initially became jasnah's ward as a ruse in order to steal jasnah's soulcaster, shallan eventually enjoyed learning from jasnah and even came to respect her greatly. during her time with jasnah, her surgebinding abilities manifested for the first time. jasnah, who herself has surgebinding abilities and is a nascent member of the knights radiant, helped shallan to develop her own powers. recognizing her potential, jasnah also arranged a causal betrothal for shallan to her cousin, adolin kholin. when shallan believed that jasnah died during the shipwreck of wind's pleasure, shallan was clearly distraught by her apparent death. when jasnah resurfaced and eventually made her way to urithiru, shallan was relieved to know that the scholar was not dead. jasnah expected that shallan would continue her duties as a ward; however, shallan did not really want to return to her old role. while attending meetings of the knights radiant, shallan expressed her frustrations with the scholar and even displayed her annoyance when around jasnah. despite this, shallan and jasnah still remain on good terms. shallan even proposed the idea that jasnah should be crowned queen of alethkar following the death of the former king, elhokar. kaladin[edit] shallan and kaladin are the first two publicly-revealed knights radiant in centuries. they initially had a strained relationship. during their first meeting, shallan was convinced by tyn to lie to kaladin, leading to her humiliating kaladin and taking his new boots. during their later meetings, shallan believed that she was being treated unfairly by kaladin, who was holding a grudge against her for events beyond her control. this clash of personalities is reflected in their respective spren, as the cryptics and honorspren (to which kaladin's spren syl belongs) are involved in a complex spren conflict. later, when stranded in the chasms of the shattered plains, they grew to respect one another. they reveal some of their personal history and deep secrets to each other, including the fact that shallan has a shardblade. due to this time, they both suspect each other of being a knight radiant. while veil and kaladin both showed some romantic interest in one another towards the end of the second book, both of their feelings for one another seemed to have dissipated by the end of the third book, after learning that kaladin killed her eldest brother, helaran. wit[edit] shallan first met wit as a child while attending the middlefest fair when he comforted her after she became distraught while thinking about the state of her family and the seemingly dark dealings her father was involved in. since then, shallan is shown to think highly of the court jester and seems to be one of the few people on roshar able to tolerate him. she was even excited to see him again when they encountered one another in the shattered plains as seen when she affectionately hugged him much to the surprise of adolin and kaladin. when shallan began to doubt herself while in kholinar, wit comforted her despite his assurance that he is not the kind man she believes him to be. despite this, shallan still confided in the man and clearly thinks of him as a friend. she even opens up about her struggle with her mental disorder, and the former court jester advises her to take control and make her other personalities serve her rather than fear them and let them control her. followers[edit] in the course of her travels, shallan has accumulated several followers. many of these followers have progressed into lightweavers themselves. together they call themselves the unseen court. - , a former spy for house - , began spying on veil in an attempt to join the ghostbloods and joined her after being

Waxillium Ladrian,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Waxillium,"""“the definition of a lawman, uncle, is easy... he's the man who takes the bullet so nobody else has to. ”-wax"" waxillium ladrian, or wax for short, is a twinborn and sixteenth high lord of house ladrian on scadrial. among the terris, wax is known as asinthew. he grew up in elendel, but left the city to escape its politics, eventually living as a lawman in the roughs for twenty years. he returned to elendel in 341 pc, after receiving word of his uncle's death, to become high lord of his house, though he continues to investigate notable criminals, particularly those connected with the set. wax is a crasher, a twinborn combination of steel misting (aka a coinshot) and an iron ferring (aka a skimmer). appearance and personality[edit] ""“that's the part that doesn't make sense. everyone knows i'm irreparably handsome. ”-wax"" wax is tall with tan skin , an intense face, and eyes that are sometimes described to be as cold as icicles. though the twenty years he spent living in the roughs have taken their toll on his appearance' leaving his hands calloused and his dark hair streaked with gray, he still maintains the lean, muscular body of his youth. accustomed to regularly sitting for a shave, wax still believes he could use a nice scar on his face, in good roughs fashion. ""“his clothing was terribly dusty, but well tailored: a fine suit, a silver cravat at the neck, twinkling cuff links on the sleeves of his fine white shirt. he had cultivated a look that appeared out of place, as if he were planning to attend a fine ball back in elendel rather than scrambling through a dead town in the roughs hunting a murderer.”-wax tracking an outlaw"" in addition to his metalminds, a pair of iron bracers he wears on his upper arms typically hidden by the cuffs of his sleeves, wax favors wearing an aluminum-lined, roughs-style hat, as well as a long, mistcloak duster over his fine city suit, vest, and cravat. wax tends to be unnaturally light on his feet, due to his habit of nearly constantly filling his metalminds with a small percentage of his weight. when on patrol, wax adds a shotgun to the pocket of his tasseled mistcloak and straps on a gunbelt fully stocked with spent bullet casings and whiskey-filled metal vials, to compliment the dual pistols holstered on his hips. wax is temperamental, rough around the edges and distrustful of modern noble society, disliking the ""games"" of the big city. he admires the simplicity of the roughs, where trouble is solved quickly and one man with a gun can make a difference, contrasting the politics of elendel, where the great houses hide their true intentions behind fake smiles and outright lies. wax also has a habitual routine of warily checking for possible attacks or any form of danger. this is seen through his constant tendency to take the safest seat in a room, or scan an area for the most defensible location. attributes and abilities[edit] metallic arts[edit] waxillium is a crasher; a coinshot and skimmer twinborn. the combination of these abilities makes waxillium a particularly dangerous individual since the strength of a steelpush is largely dependent on the mass of the allomancer. allomancy[edit] waxillium is an extremely skilled coinshot. perhaps the biggest mark of his mastery is his ability to regulate the strength of his steelpushes. generally, allomancers find it too hard to maintain a fine control over their steelpushes, so instead most opt to regulate the length of the time of them. levitating without bobbing up and down, for example, requires extreme discipline that few allomancers can achieve; most use short bursts of steelpushes, fall down, then push again. waxillium is able to apply enough pressure on a small metal rod to make it stick to the side of a table without moving the table itself with ease. wax also uses his ability to form a defensive bubble around himself that doesn't affect his own metal items but pushes bullets coming at him off course slightly; to enhance the velocity of his bullets, pushing them after being shot to force them through an opponents cover; and to travel in the air, in combination with his skimmer ability to regulate his mass. wax doesn't appear to use the most obvious ability of a coinshot very often, as he had to be reminded that he could launch a bullet without a gun, although he always uses steel for his third vest button as an extra metal reserve or to use as a weapon in emergencies. while trying to stop the set in bilming, wax burned a small amount of lerasium, making him a mistborn, therefore allowing him to burn all allomantically viable metals. feruchemy[edit] as a skimmer, using iron metalminds, wax can store his weight at the cost of being lighter than normal, and tap the storage to become heavier. wax constantly stores his weight to make him about three-quarters of his normal weight, making him lighter on his feet. he also uses this ability to navigate vertically in combination with steelpushing and a shotgun. wax doesn't tap into his weight very often, preferring to store it to be lighter, as a result, the sheer amount of weight he can tap in to allows him to quite easily fall straight through a floor with no effort. he uses this power to his advantage many times. he eventually embedded his ironminds deep into his skin to protect them from allomancers. hemalurgy[edit] waxillium has an earring with a slight hemalurgic charge. it is unknown what type of charge it is. the earring is a feature of pathism, adherents to the religion often wear metal earrings while praying. this enables harmony to communicate directly with him. it was given to him by the kandra melaan. while trying to stop the set in bilming, wax gave himself an electrum spike in his lower chest, granting him allomantic duralumin. he also extensively studied spook's notes about hemalurgy, and created charts of all of the points on the body where spikes could be placed, and a detailed list of the ways the spikes worked. law enforcement[edit] wax spent twenty years as a lawman in the roughs. his exploits are a matter of public record, kept at the university in elendel where they are studied by students of law and criminology. ""“reports trickle in. from the roughs. most of them get written up by someone. you can find them at the university or at the right bookshop. ”-marasi on wax's notable cases"" - , a rapist and - . the first man wax ever brought in. - , a butcher turned murderer. wax needed miles hundredlives to bring him in. - , an unhinged mortician who created grisly scenes with his victims bodies. - , a lawman gone criminal. leader of the vanishers. - , an insane kandra. - , wax's long lost uncle and member of the set. - , wax's sister, avatar of - and leader of the - . other skills[edit] wax is a talented marksman, preferring to use two guns at once. miles hundredlives stated that wax was the finest marksman he had ever seen, and had seen him make shots that he would have thought impossible. he has been shown to shoot a bullet that was put off course by the speed bubble of a slider, scoring a lethal shot as a result. however, due to a traumatic misfire that resulted in the death of a loved one, lessie, wax tends to act nervously when faced with hostage situations. wax is skilled at metallurgy, and he is shown to be a talented investigator. history[edit] early life[edit] waxillium is a descendant of edgard ladrian and allrianne cett. he is of mixed heritage, with terris on his mother's side and noble on his father's side, and he is said to have more terris blood than most. he was raised under a noble house and lived a life of luxury--something he detested. he and his sister, telsin, were mostly raised by their uncle in elendel, with their parents dying in what was reported as an accident. telsin claims this death was due to harmony's agents trying to get to her, but the veracity of this claim is not known. at the age of 12, his uncle began grooming him to run the family-operated first central bank. wax became disgusted by the unethical practices of the bank and distanced himself from the role. the village[edit] at the age of 15, wax spent a year living in the village, with the option to stay if he wished. during his last months in the village, he encountered forch, a twinborn terris boy who committed arson. wax investigated the crime and brought his evidence to the attention of the constables, but this was ultimately disregarded by his grandmother who insisted that the terris people manage themselves and their criminals. wax unintentionally spotted forch later that night and believed he was going to commit arson again. investigating further, wax unknowingly stumbled upon forch attempting to dissect a living boy he had kidnapped. despite being heavily outmatched by another twinborn, wax ultimately killed forch in self defense during a steelpushing battle, rescuing the child from him. this is when wax decided to leave the village and strike out on his own. the roughs[edit] in his early years in the roughs, wax developed an image of himself as a ""gentleman bounty hunter""; although initially incompetent and unfamiliar with his twinborn abilities, he would eventually hone them. at one point, he had a deputy named paclo. he pro-actively worked with other law enforcers in the area, eventually working with jon deadfinger and finding a 17 year old wayne who he would ultimately spare from execution and turn his life around to become a lawman. during a bounty claim on granite joe, he encountered lessie--a woman he would fall in love with and eventually marry. after the reported death of his uncle, wax was implored to return to elendel to begin managing the ledgers of his house. initially ignoring this request, wax chose instead to hunt the murderous bloody tan as his final bounty. in a horrifying turn of events, waxillium mistakenly shot lessie in the forehead when he attempted to free her from bloody tan's clutches. with nothing left for him in the roughs, wax returned to his family mansion in elendel. return to elendel[edit] ""“he always felt stronger in the mists. he felt like someone was watching, when he was out in them.”-wax thinks of the mists"" in his early months in elendel, wax earned a reputation for frequently disappearing early from social functions, preferring to steel-push through the mists, in patrol of the city. on one such night, waxillium paused his patrol and intervened in a shootout. believing he heard a woman's whimper, which reminded him of lessie, wax froze during the gunfight. coming to the conclusion that he was no longer capable of being a lawman, and with the effectiveness of the city constabulary forcing him to face the irrelevance of vigilante justice in general, wax hung up his guns for good. throwing himself into the much more mundane effort of saving his house's financial future, waxillium spent half a year working to reverse his late uncle's squandering of the family funds. believing there was no other choice, he entered into a marriage agreement with lord harms' daughter, steris, hopeful that her father's money would help bring house ladrian back from the brink of destitution. that same day, wayne, an old partner from his time in the roughs, re-entered wax's life--carrying with him an aluminum bullet and a tantalizing mystery surrounding a gang of train robbers known as the vanishers, which threatened to draw wax away from his house responsibilities and right back into the life of a lawman. the vanishers[edit] against his better judgement, and under the disapproving eye of his butler, tillaume, wax began to piece together the history of the vanishers, hoping to discover the reason for their unorthodox targets as well as the secret behind the way they commit their crimes. realizing the distraction this had created for his house duties, waxillium endeavored to put away this new obsession and attended the yomen-ostlin wedding dinner with steris, marking their public debut as a couple. ""“it was so hard not to recall the sight of him breaking through the line of tables, gun in hand as he expertly felled two of the men trying to haul her out into the night. or the sight of him soaring through the air-gunshots exploding up from beneath, the chandeliers shattering and crystal spraying light around him-as he shot a man from midair and dropped to rescue his friend. she was talking to a legend.”-marasi calls on waxillium in his study"" after the wedding was interrupted by the arrival of bandits from the vanishers gang, who proceeded to rob the lords and ladies in attendance at gunpoint, wax initially refused wayne's insistence that he take up a pistol--having convinced himself that the elendel constabulary would be able to handle the disturbance with far less bloodshed. when the gang went too far, killing a man and taking steris as a hostage, wax admitted that he could not stand idly by, and attacked the gang with his backup pistols and the full fury of his steelpushing. in the ensuing gunfight, wax, wayne, and steris' cousin marasi worked together to subdue the majority of the attackers, while successfully minimizing civilian casualties. when marasi was suddenly held at gunpoint by one of the gang, in the same fashion as lessie a year ago, wax nearly froze up again. marasi struggled, successfully stunning the vanisher holding her, momentarily opening up the shot for wax--forcing him to make a choice to overcome his fear to pull the trigger and save her. as the robbers retreated, waxillium was surprised to discover the identity of the vanishers' leader, miles ""hundredlives"" dagouter--another former lawman from the roughs. with steris kidnapped, wax re-doubled his efforts into his previous investigation. having obtained one of the vanishers' aluminum guns, wax poured himself into researching its makeup and possible origin as well as uncovering the mystery of the vanishers' ultimate goal. in the middle of his investigation, wax, wayne, and marasi were caught up in an explosion in his study, set off by his butler in a botched attempt to assassinate him. eventually discovering the location of the vanishers' hideout and confirming hundredlives' involvement, wax began forming a plan to take down the unbeatable, former lawman. focusing his attention on puzzling out the vanishers' peculiar robbery methods, wax was taken by surprise when the vanishers attacked his train en route back to elendel. wounded in the attack and shaken by hundredlives' claim that the real evil in the world is the corruption of elendel itself, waxillium escaped to ranette's house, where he obtained hazekiller bullets and a new prototype revolver, vindication. correctly deducing the vanishers' next target, wax set wayne and marasi to work, zeroing in on the protection of lord tekiel's next shipment train, which included the new, breaknaught cargo car. infiltrating the car just before the predicted robbery took place, wax allowed himself to be taken to the vanishers' lair. making use of a large amount of dynamite smuggled alongside him in the breaknaught, waxillium fought his way through the vanishers' hideout, unfortunately losing vindication in the fray. successfully springing a trap made specially to capture hundredlives, wax was then forced to flee when the outlaw opted to blow himself up with a personal explosive, rather than be captured. escaping into the mists, waxillium briefly experienced a conversation with harmony, which culminated in the realization that harmony had worked behind the scenes to orchestrate the delivery of wax's old, lost weapons to the vanishers' hideout, just in time to help. newly re-armed, wax located and rescued steris, killed numerous members of the vanishers gang, and destroyed their hideout with a tremendous feat of metalborn power. as the building collapsed, several surviving vanishers, led by the now fully-healed, miles hundredlives, held marasi at gunpoint. refusing to freeze up and lose another woman's life to the same type of standoff, wax called for wayne to create a speed bubble. firing at the vanisher through the speed bubble, wax compensated for the unavoidable veering of the time-slowed bullet by firing a second time, in an incredibly aimed shot which struck his first bullet and caused it to ricochet directly into the thug's head. miles and an already injured wax squared off, with hundredlives beating wax mercilessly. waxillium held on, taking the punishment of miles' blows as marasi secretly held them in a time bubble. wax successfully distracted the outlaw, laying all of his hopes on the absent wayne, who finally returned, having surrounded the three of them with elendel's constables. meeting mister suit[edit] after the surviving vanishers were taken into custody and interrogated, waxillium recognized the description of a man working with miles whom they called ""mister suit,"" which led him to believe they were talking about his supposed late uncle, edwarn ladrian. following up on a lead to suit's current whereabouts, wax boarded a train at dryport and confirmed his suspicions. confronting his uncle face to face, waxillium demanded that edwarn give up the location of the other women the vanishers had kidnapped. unthreatened, edwarn welcomed wax to attempt to expose his operation, as there was no real proof pointing to the old man's involvement. wax listened as his uncle chastised him for his purported self-righteousness, just as he did when wax was a child. when wax moved to take matters into his own hands, edwarn called in his men, who threw wax off the back of the train--but not before wax swiped his uncle's appointment book. bleeder[edit] newly rescued, steris suggested to wax that their shared ordeal afforded the two of them an opportunity to speed up their marriage contract and announce their engagement much sooner then previously planned. initially hesitant, wax agreed that the couple should move forward with steris' suggestion, endeavoring to push away any potentially romantic thoughts of marasi and bury his painful memories of lessie. due to his invaluable contributions toward the resolution of the vanishers case, wax was granted a citywide deputized forbearance by the elendel senate as well as certain allowances to practice his roughs-style justice in the city. this was expedited by harmony using tensoon, who imitated a high ranking member of the constabulary to push the documents through. tormented by the past[edit] months later, while steelpushing through the crowded city streets in hot pursuit of a bank robber known as the marksman (an allomancer connected with the set who featured in edwarn's appointment book) wax was stunned and deeply disturbed to recognize the face of an onlooker on the sidewalk below--bloody tan, lessie's murderer. shaken and unable to locate tan among the crowds, wax enlisted the help of wayne and marasi to continue the chase into the breakouts. eventually catching marks, wax was prevented from bringing the man in for questioning when marks was suddenly killed by an assassin's crossbow. approached by a number of constables who arrived late on the scene, wax learned that constable-general claude aradel would like to quietly enlist his assistance in investigating the recent murder of elendel governer replar innate's brother, winsting, who had been killed among thirty of elendel's most notorious criminals. examining the scene, wax determined that winsting was stabbed by someone familiar to the man, citing the location of the killings, the position of the bodies, and the sheer number of victims--details which also dictated that feruchemically enhanced speed would have been required to perform the grisly feat. wax steeled himself, knowing he was now on the trail of a steelrunner. starting his search in the best place to find word of a rogue feruchemist, wax visited the terris village to obtain the counsel of his grandmother, vwafendal. recognizing the name idashwy, a steelrunner from his past who had recently left the village, wax continued his investigation elsewhere, enlisting wayne's help to discover the woman's address in the city. blindsided by another momentary glimpse of bloody tan on the crowded streets, wax began to doubt his own senses. shaking off the distraction, wax joined wayne in discovering idashwy's corpse, laying in her kitchen with a large hole bored through her chest. having spent great amounts of time studying a book gifted to him by ironeyes himself, wax recognized the likelihood of idashwy having been the victim of the creation of a hemalurgic spike. guessing that the killer used the spike to steal her feruchemical speed, wax was surprised to find a note written to himself hidden in the victim's pocket. on the note were some of the last words bloody tan said to him, back in the roughs. ""“someone else moves us, lawman.”-bloody tan"" needing time to think, wax rode alone in his carriage, driven by hoid. casually musing upon whether his pathian earring may have once been a hermalurgic spike, wax placed it into his ear. immediately, harmony spoke to wax directly--careful to reassure him that he had not gone insane. harmony admitted that the earring was a spike, which was the reason they were able to converse. additionally, harmony explained that wax's earlier sightings of bloody tan were real and not imagined, though the murderer wax had been chasing all this time was not a man, but actually a faceless immortal using tan's bones, named bleeder. pursuit of a mad woman[edit] while attending lady zobell's party with steris, wax met melaan, a faceless immortal sent to help in the hunt for bleeder by harmony himself. in between chats with various nobility of the city, wax began to hear a new voice in his head--mocking him and the people of elendel. wax soon realized he was hearing the voice of bleeder, who had somehow learned to use the same hermalurgic connection to him that harmony had. using their connection to discover bleeder's location at the party, wax attempted to apprehend her, giving chase out a window and through the mists of the city outside. his pursuit of bleeder waylaid by a dozen armed men, wax was convinced that she must be aligned with the set. wax listened closely as bleeder spoke in his mind of her plans to kill the governor and free the city from harmony's influence, but first she claimed she would need to murder wax's father. guessing that she must have been threatening lord harms' life, wax raced across the city, spiriting the old man and steris to separate, secret locations. finally believing he had moved one step ahead of bleeder, wax reported to governor innate to warn him of the dire threat to his life, only to discover that during his absence bleeder had brutally killed father bin, the survivorist priest who was to perform his marriage ceremony to steris. tracking bleeder's path, wax located the carriage she had used to escape the scene of the killing. inside, wax found traces of perchwither, a substance only found in the homeland of the faceless immortals. puzzled, wax followed her trail back to the governor's mansion. once close enough to her location, bleeder's voice immediately returned to his mind, keen to convince wax that harmony did not care and was only using him. sowing doubt, bleeder asked wax to attempt to explain why harmony had failed to step in and save lessie's life. distracted, wax was unable to prevent bleeder from using her stolen steelrunner abilities to attack innate's chambers. by the time wax arrived, bleeder had already disappeared, though thankfully leaving the governor alive. looking closer, wax found another message from bleeder, this time written in the blood of her latest kill. ""“i rip out his tongue to stop the lies. i stab out his eyes to hide from his gaze. you will be free.”-bleeder"" seeking more information on bleeder, wax entered the museum in the field of rebirth. locating the secret path through the historical atium mines, wax entered the cavern leading to the homeland, and encountered tensoon, legendary wolfhound of the ascendant warrior. tensoon told wax much of bleeder's history and showed him a torn up and desecrated copy of the words of founding--the product of one of her last acts before leaving the homeland and evidence of her descent into madness. wax and tensoon found themselves chased from the homeland by the sudden appearance of hemalurgic chimeras--deformed humans under bleeder's control--but not before wax came to realize the full scope of her plan. she didn't want to simply kill the governor; she wanted to incite a city-wide riot. wax immediately returned to innate's mansion, intent on saving his life once and for all. after entering the governor's study, wax noticed a carefully placed gumball, which he recognized to be a sign of trouble, left for him by wayne. immediately realizing the truth--that bleeder had been secretly impersonating the governor the entire time--wax pulled out his gun. bleeder opened fire first, killing innate's guards as she escaped out the window. confronting a memory[edit] steelpushing through the night after bleeder, wax easily found her, changing bodies again just before she moved to escape. finally confronting her on the eastbridge, wax saw that bleeder had pointed her gun at him, but she did not fire. with tears in her eyes, she pleaded with wax to forsake harmony and be free. wax ignored the pain he felt, seeing that bleeder was now wearing the face of his dead wife, lessie. he did his best not to listen to how well bleeder could mimic lessie's voice and mannerisms. wax levelled vindication and shot her in the head with the bullet from the gun's special chamber. the bullet had been made to his request by ranette, molded from his pathian earring. it was designed to give bleeder a second spike, allowing harmony to reassert hemalurgic control over the mad kandra. bleeder screamed that she would not be controlled again. as she died in wax's arms, having terminated her own life to prevent harmony from returning her to his service, bleeder begged wax to ask harmony why he originally sent her to protect him, back in the roughs. telling wax that she loved him, she demanded to know why, if harmony was such a wonderful, all-knowing god, he would use wax to kill her. too late, wax realized that the woman he had shot was not just bleeder, an insane murderer and faceless immortal who looked like lessie; she was lessie. in the weeks that followed, wax bitterly grieved his wife's final death, greatly distancing himself from harmony for keeping bleeder's identity secret from him. forsaking even the mists he used to cherish, wax largely shied away from his public responsibilities, showing little interest in following up on the city intrigues wayne, melaan, and marasi had uncovered while bleeder's plan unraveled. offering little in the manner of resistance, wax even agreed to postpone the wedding with steris as he flirted with surrendering to his depression. the bands of mourning[edit] ""“in the back of his noggin, he'll be relieved that i stopped the wedding. he'll figure it was me, deep in his subcontinence, and will pay for the damages-no matter what the assessor says. and he won't say anything, won't even investigate. watch.”-wayne speaks with marasi"" six months later, spurred on by a slowly growing bond with steris and determined not to remain in the same well of despair that had tried to claim him when he lost lessie the first time, wax had returned to the pursuit of his constabulary duties with wayne. when the day of his wedding with steris arrived, wax found himself pursued once again by a member of harmony's kandra; this one claiming to have a matter of great importance to discuss. rebuffing him, wax continued on to the survivorist church where he walked down the aisle with steris, whose genuine tears moved him in a way he did not expect. realizing he was still not ready to let go of lessie's memory, wax was blessedly spared the need for any further heartbreak when a water tower outside suddenly tipped onto the roof of the church, bathing all those in attendance and postponing the ceremony once again, much to wax's relief. to new seran[edit] wax unholstered vindication and downed a new vial of metals as he returned to ladrian mansion later that day; the telltale clues of intrusion in his own home had quickly brought him to high alert. discovering that this newest threat turned out to be nothing more than the same kandra as before, now seated in wax's own study, had done little to encourage him to lower his pistol. the kandra, vendell, of the sixth generation, had successfully ensnared marasi and wayne in his appeal for assistance, but wax believed that vendell had done so simply as another way to entangle him into the affair, while ignoring his earlier refusal. pouncing on wax's curiosity, vendell produced an evanoscope, which he used to engage him in a presentation on the nature of investiture and identity, as well as the myth of the bands of mourning. wax's patience wearing thin, vendell explained that these evanotype images had been taken by another kandra, reluur, who was obsessed with the bands and convinced they were identity-less metalminds which held the potential to grant anyone metalborn powers to rival those of the lord ruler. dismissing the idea outright, wax was shocked to see another evanotype impressed with an image of his sister, telsin, who was being dragged somewhere against her will. vendell informed him that reluur had been accosted by the same thugs in new seran, where one of his spikes had been stolen. convinced of the danger and worried for his sister, wax agreed to help. ""“what is it about you that makes me want to punch you, even when you're saying something helpful?”-wax to vendell"" with real proof that his sister was alive for the first time in years, wax knew he was being manipulated into doing harmony's bidding again; though this time, he endeavored to step in with his eyes wide open. wax categorically rejected vendell's extended gifting of another pathian earring. he would do this on his own, without harmony's voice in his ear. joined on the train to new seran by steris, who was becoming increasingly familiar and useful company, wax soon found it difficult to interrupt her intense reading of a book. he needed to mine her keen knowledge of local politics and slake his curiosity after he noticed increased protests of elendel's tariffs, visible out the windows as they passed through the outer cities. distracting her further, wax was delighted to finally catch a glimpse of what had earlier held steris' attention so doggedly--she had been reading a book on basic human reproduction. mortified, steris attempted to change the subject, but the discovery only added to wax's growing affection for the woman. feeling the train car suddenly slowing, wax sprang into action. guessing rightly that robbers had disconnected their car, he leaped to the tracks below and then tapped his metalmind to greatly increase his weight, which allowed him to steelpush the train car back down the tracks fast enough to reconnect. wax pushed himself back onto the train, which was already being boarded by a large group of gunmen on horseback. leaving steris in marasi's care, wax fought his way through the train, eventually squaring off against, a huge metalborn brute, whose large bulk turned out to be a great target for ranette's latest gift to wax's arsenal--an allomantically-triggered hook device which proved particularly well suited to throwing people from a train. after securing the train and allowing a doctor to tend to his wounds at ironstand station, wax began to worry that the still missing wayne might have been seriously hurt or incapacitated in the battle. wax's concern soon melted to annoyance when his long search of the train turned up both wayne and melaan who were holed up together in a private compartment, groggy from a tussle of their own. eventually arriving in new seran, wax and steris agreed that the best way to begin their investigation was to attend a ball at the home of lady kelesina shores, where they would be sure to scrape as much information as possible from the city's upper crust. as they approached the mansion, wax gave a bank note to a well spoken beggar, who insisted he take in exchange a strange coin, made of two different metals, branded with the face of a man spiked through one eye, and covered in symbols that wax could not read. separating, the two mingled among the elite and gathered what rumors they could, including some regarding a hushed building project that may have involved allomancers, north east of the city. gruff around the edges as ever, and surrounded by as practiced liars and thieves as he had ever faced before, wax knew he still had a lot to learn about politics. still, he gained more information than he expected, even detecting that there was more going on with lady kelesina than she let on. interrupted just as he was about to extend an invitation to lady felise demoux, wax instead shared a dance with khriss, who was excited to question wax extensively about his particular pairing of feruchemical and allomantic abilities. pushing for more information than seemed proper, and displaying an uncomfortably high level of knowledge of his powers, khriss increased wax's already heavy suspicions, as he returned to asking other guests of the party questions of his own. sensing that lady kelesina was making a quick escape from the party, wax scrambled to find a way to exit in pursuit, without alerting anyone that he was following. ever prepared, steris armed wax with a pistol she had snuck into the dance and then produced the requisite distraction, from the bottom of a vial of ipecac. following as carefully as possible, wax caught up to kelesina deep in her mansion, where he overheard the unmistakable voice of his uncle through the door to her bedroom. wax listened as edwarn detailed his involvement in both the train robbery from the day before as well as further plans to stymie wax and keep him off his trail. bursting through the door without any hesitation, wax was immediately disarmed by kelesina's pewter-burning steward. beckoned by edwarn, whose words were actually emitted from an odd voice projector sitting in the room, the steward turned and murdered kelesina with wax's gun, tidily implicating him, a visiting noble from elendel, in the assassination of one of new seran's political elite. with the timely arrival of melaan, wax fought his way out of the mansion and escaped with steris, who he found waiting for him behind a shrub outside. taking her close, wax steelpushed their way straight up into the sky and through the evening mists, which gave way to the breathtaking view of the ascendant's field, where they shared a quiet moment of mutual respect and kissed above the clouds. uncovering the weapon[edit] staying ahead of the local authorities and following up on their only lead from the party, wax rode a stagecoach toward the construction site to the northeast. along the way, he helped marasi field test the cube device she had taken from the train robbers, which they took to calling an allomantic grenade as it seemed to somehow extend the area of effect of its user's allomancy. wax, wayne, melaan, and marasi successfully infiltrated the construction site, discovering that a large, nondescript building was actually a facade covering up edwarn's real effort in new seran--the apparent construction of a huge, wooden warship. splitting from marasi and melaan, who went in search of reluur's stolen spike, wax and wayne entered the warship, determined to locate edwarn himself. using a spyglass borrowed from melaan, wax immediately changed their plan when he located the chamber where telsin was being held. easily bypassing the workmen and engineers blocking his path, wax quietly entered the room dead set on saving his sister. finally reunited, wax was surprised when telsin immediately took brutal retribution on one of her captors. the years had really changed her just as, he supposed, they had changed him. fighting their way out, accompanied by a generous helping of speed bubble assistance from wayne, wax joined in a grand escape after allik, a masked man that marasi had rescued, revealed the existence of a second, smaller ship which could detach from the main vessel and lift into the sky. ""“you were always the quiet one. the thoughtful one. how did you get here? i... your face, waxillium. you're old.”-telsin"" briefly stopping their ship to pick up steris, wax and marasi pored over a notebook that she stole from edwarn, which seemed to show the location of a second work site, south of their position. this corroborated telsin's claims that edwarn had been obsessively working to find a great weapon in the south that promised to give the set the ability to dominate the whole of the basin. telsin warned wax that their uncle had set off to retrieve the weapon not long ago; it was clear that there wasn't much time. marasi's notebook also included a map showing a temple marked for excavation in the peaks of the southern mountains, which reignited the palpable fear that the set could be dangerously close to obtaining the fabled bands of mourning, just as vendell had warned back in elendel. taking advantage of their more efficient form of travel, wax's group arrived on the mountain peaks soundly before edwarn and his men could complete their slow climb through the snow. locating the temple from marasi's notebook, wax ventured inside, proceeding with caution after he encountered the scattered remains of treasure hunters who had been there before him. making grand use of melaan's nigh-invincibility, wax and allik worked slowly through the temple's ancient security system, safely triggering traps that would have spelled certain death for any other group of trespassers. halted by a door which was inscribed with writing that none of them could decipher, wax returned to the entrance of the temple, where steris, marasi, and wayne held edwarn at gunpoint; his expedition had arrived at the temple just before wax's return. edwarn claimed to know the secret to opening the temple's final door and threatened wax that he had an overwhelming force of allomancers and goons surrounding the temple who would not hesitate to kill every member of wax's pitiful group, unless he was allowed to join them in collecting the bands. when the temple's last chamber proved to be missing the bands, wax suddenly found himself in an armed standoff with telsin, who he had rightly suspected to be a mole for the set. both siblings fired at once; wax's bullet went wild and missed, but telsin's shot hit wax just below the neck. a number of bullets later, wax fell into a pit below the bands' supposed resting chamber. trailing blood and weakening by the moment, wax was soon tracked down by edwarn, now fully revealed as an allomancer, by way hemalurgic spikes. edwarn cruelly triggered another of the temple's traps, which collapsed the roof and crushed wax's already wounded body under a punishing avalanche of rubble. in a daze, wax was forced to watch helplessly as his uncle approached, unholstering his pistol and intent on finishing him off. when wayne arrived to attempt his rescue and broke down at the sight of him, wax used his remaining breath to tell his friend to go on living and keep fighting. no longer able to hold on, waxillium ladrian died. return[edit] ""“wax clenched his jaw, but couldn't force down the trembling that took him. he lived it again, holding her as she died. knowing he'd killed her. that hatred seethed inside of him. hatred for harmony. hatred for the world. and yes. hatred for himself.”-wax reflects on lessie's death."" immediately, wax found himself in the presence of harmony. face to face with the god he had shunned for so long, wax did not shirk away; instead, wax laid into harmony for his inaction that had led to so many people suffering. he chastised him for using wax all these years with what appeared to be so little regard. he demanded an explanation for what happened to lessie. together, the two of them philosophized on the nature of cause and effect. harmony patiently explained that his workings were larger in scope than wax could currently understand. he expanded wax's worldview-- showing him a representation of the planet and allowing him a small glimpse of the greater conflict in which he was currently embroiled. allowing wax to choose, harmony offered him a chance at ""another adventure,"" which wax accepted. wax opened his eyes and screamed, throwing the rubble from his body with the pure strength of steel itself. his body instantaneously healed, wax focused his view on marasi who had placed something like an oversized spearhead in his hand: the real bands of mourning, an unkeyed metalmind of nearly limitless power. tapping the enormously potent metalmind inside the spearhead, wax burst through the confines of the temple and out into the open air, trailing mist in his wake. able to sense and call upon what seemed to be endless trace metals in the surrounding area, wax knew that he could crush edwarn and telsin's fleeing ship with little effort. bringing himself under control, wax confronted his uncle for the final time, choosing to subdue him without the use of the spearhead's dangerous power. wax finally returned to elendel, where he gave over the spearhead into the hands of the kandra. no longer willing to put it off, and ready to move on with his life, wax convinced steris to marry him in a quiet ceremony, highlighted by their newly blossomed love for each other. on their honeymoon, wax was suddenly awakened by the sound of an explosion in the distance. wandering their suite, wax found himself absently handling the dual metal coin that the beggar had given him, before the party in new seran. looking closely at the coin for what seemed like the first time, wax hesitantly tested tapping it like a metalmind, which sprang to life a copper-stored memory, seemingly belonging to the mysterious sovereign. lawman senator of the roughs[edit] shortly after the events in the south, he retired as a lawman and became a senator in order to try to bring about change. he also settled down with steris, and had two children, maxillium and tindwyl ladrian. upon hearing about the elendel supremacy bill, he began to go across the outer cities and roughs in an attempt to gather support, from both the people, governors, and other senators. he also looked for the corruption and sold votes in the senate, so that he could attempt to reveal it to stall the vote. he ultimately failed, with the bill passing. later, he was experimenting with trellium (supplied to him by marasi, taken as a spike from the corpse of a cycle she had killed in a constable operation that day) and harmonium, and discovered their explosive interaction with each other. this filled him with panic over the idea of the set having already discovered it before him. relationships[edit] lessie[edit] wax was romantically involved with and informally married to a female lawkeeper named lessie out in the roughs, but she was shot after being held hostage by the infamous criminal bloody tan. unbeknownst to wax, she was the kandra paalm, sent to protect wax while he was in the roughs. after she had removed one of her spikes, wax shot paalm with a hemalurgically charged bullet, allowing harmony to take control of her. wayne[edit] wax's best friend is wayne, a fellow lawman from the roughs. wax helped wayne turn his life around after wayne accidentally shot and killed a man in a botched robbery attempt. he accompanies wax on his adventures, and is his most trusted ally. steris harms[edit] after returning to elendel, wax reluctantly enters into a marriage contract with steris harms, in order to benefit both their houses. it is here that wax meets marasi, steris' illegitimate half-sister. it seemed like wax and marasi would develop a romantic relationship, however, this does not come to pass. eventually, he becomes fascinated by the idiosyncrasies of steris, leading them to fall in love and marry for emotional reasons. children[edit] waxillium and steris have two children, maxillium ladrian and tindwyl ladrian. wax enjoys flying with maxillium, and maxillium helped wax transition from lawman to senator and father. sazed[edit] waxillium nurses a personal grudge against harmony. although he agrees with the shard that he wouldn't have wanted someone else to have killed paalm or for her to have had to continue to suffer the trellium spike that she was using, he resents the fact that he hadn't known that the kandra was his wife until she was dying. bavadin[edit] wax hates autonomy for the threat that she poses to all of scadrial, and devotes everything to stopping her and the set. bavadin loves wax, seeing him as a masterpiece that perfectly reflects her ideals, regretting that harmony got to him first. due to this, she challenged him that scadrial deserves to be left alone. telsin[edit] he has always had a rather antagonistic relationship with his sister, which was only exacerbated by his discovery that she was in the set. quotes[edit] ""“i saw it in his eyes, first. that hunger, that fire. and then i found it in myself. he's a flame, waxillium is, and fire can be shared. when i'm out here, when i'm with him, i burn, marasi. it's wonderful. ”-steris"" ""“the law is there to keep us from ruining everyone else's ability to explore. without law, there's no freedom. that's why i am what i am. ”-wax"" ""“i have known you for an entire year now, lord waxillium. i can accept you for who you are, but i am under no illusions. something will happen at our wedding. a villain will burst in, guns firing. or we'll discover explosives in the altar. or father bin will inexplicably turn out to be an old enemy and attempt to murder you instead of performing the ceremony. it will happen. ”-steris"" ""“you're wrong about me... i'm not harmony's hands. i'm his sword. ”-wax confronts bleeder"" ""“steris, i think we're all like that. shuffled from place to place by duty, or society, or god himself. it seems like we're just along for the ride, even in our own lives. but once in a while, we do face a choice. a real one. we may not be able to choose what happens to us, or where we'll stop, but we point ourselves in a direction. ”-wax"" ""“i have done something to help. i sent you. ”-harmony speaks to wax"" trivia[edit] - brandon originally intended wax's instinctive ability to create a steel bubble to be a result of him being a - in the combination of his allomantic and feruchemical powers. he has since backed up on that, as he realized wax wasn't showing any savant-like consequences. - wax is one of only three crashers ever born. - wax prefers - whiskey in his allomantic vials. steris prefers to use cod-liver oil in the vials that she prepares for wax. ""“whiskey is bad for you, lord waxillium. a wife must look out for her husband's health. ”-steris"" - wax has drawn upon the mists at some point. - wax has been involved in more than seventeen explosions. notes[edit]"
Telsin Ladrian,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Telsin,"telsin ladrian is a member of house ladrian and sister of waxillium on scadrial. she is a high-ranking member of the set who is referred to by underlings as lady sequence, and eventually rose to the position of the key. appearance and personality[edit] telsin is middle aged and has dark hair in curls and a rugged body. while living in the village as a teen, she showed disdain for following rules. waxillium describes her as duplicitous and manipulative, being good at hiding her true intentions and always being able to get what she wants. attributes and abilities[edit] telsin is a windwhisperer and can store her senses in a metalmind which she claims makes her immune to torture. telsin is also a hemalurgist, and originally had three spikes, granting her the power of a coinshot, bloodmaker, and leecher respectively, due to the fact that having four or more hemalurgic spikes would make her susceptible to harmony's complete control. after the set learned how to bypass this restriction, she gained another spike granting her the power of a lurcher. history[edit] youth[edit] like her brother wax, she lived in the village for a time as a youth and was subject to their uncle's attempts to wrest their upbringing from their parents. when wax left the village after killing forch, she did not leave at that time. she loved to draw, so her uncle kept an easel with a large pad of paper in ladrian mansion for her use. telsin and wax were not close; they were practically strangers. over the course of twenty years with very little contact between them, they both fell prey to laxity in their attempts to stay in touch. when edwarn faked his own death in the carriage accident, he faked hers as well. the set[edit] edwarn claims that she recruited him into the set. edwarn reveals to wax that her death was also faked and that she is ""safe."" wax comes to believe that his uncle is holding her captive. when he confronts him, he tells wax that if he kills him, ""your sister is as good as dead."" wax promises to address her kidnapping after dealing with bleeder. wax finds telsin under guard in a secret set fortress in dulsing. wax rescues her, and she acts as if she wants revenge on all the members of the set. when the set's thug enters the room, she immediately shoots him dead, blowing their cover and leading to a desperate escape on the skimmer. telsin convinces wax that they must go to the temple before suit's expedition so that they can claim the bands of mourning. as they fly there, the skimmer flies over the group and telsin ""accidentally"" causes wayne to kick a pack overboard, hitting one of the guards and alerting them to their presence. this action, along with her quick shooting of the thug (who would have revealed her true identity), causes wax to suspect her. after encountering suit and entering the temple, telsin betrays wax and shoots him three times before he can escape through a trap. she also incapacitates melaan, injecting her and taking her spikes. she was a member of the set all along. known as lady sequence, she outranks even suit. after marasi finds the bands of mourning and turns the tide of the encounter, telsin attempts to escape on the skimmer. wayne finds her and shoots her multiple times with a shotgun to avenge wax's (temporary) death. he figures she has hemalurgic health anyway, so he doesn't have much compunction about shooting her. after reclaiming the spikes she was carrying, he lets her go. later, wax finds the skimmer gone, indicating that she had escaped. avatar of autonomy[edit] she eventually was chosen by autonomy to become her avatar. notes[edit]"
Ker'reen,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ker%27reen,"ker'reen is the predominant religion of kerzta. the philosophy calls for worship of the sun, teaching that it is the manifestation of the sand lord and the source of autonomy and independence. the ker'reen philosophy denounces the use of sand mastery as heresy, which has led to war between kerzta and lossand in the past. the priest daikeen oversees the religion among kerztians. they are led by the a'kar, or high priest. members of the priest daikeen are traditionally marked by square-shaped scars on their foreheads, though some have recently been found to wear x-shaped scars similar to the tattoos of the warrior daikeen. members of the clergy speak karshad. the kerkor is the primary religious text of the ker'reen religion. notes[edit]"
Soulcasting,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Soulcast,"""“i need you to change. ”-shallan"" soulcasting is a form of surgebinding on roshar that involves manipulating the surge of transformation to turn one material into another. a soulcaster may refer to a special kind of fabrial which allows its user to soulcast, a person who uses such a device, or a person who is able to soulcast by means of surgebinding. mechanics[edit] soulcasting is the manifestation of the surge of transformation, normally available only to the orders of lightweavers and elsecallers. it allows the user to transform any material into any other material, with possible exception of gemstones and shards. this is performed by altering the object's spiritual nature. under most circumstances, soulcasting is mass-conservative. a soulcast object is generally room temperature, although fire may be an exception to this. in order to perform a soulcasting, the user needs to send their mind into shadesmar to connect with the cognitive aspect of the object they wish changed. once connected, they must convince the object to change. the transformation itself consumes stormlight at a rate that can crack the gemstones holding it. the target of soulcasting can be an inanimate item or a person, although a person will present greater difficulty, due to the innate investiture they hold. highly-invested people, like knights radiant or mistborn, and natural investiture blockers, like aluminium or shardplate, will resist soulcasting. likewise, soulcasting cannot create materials that are naturally invested, such as god metals. aluminium, however, can be created via soulcasting, although it cannot be turned into anything else. a metalmind that is soulcast into a different type of metal, will retain its feruchemical charge, however, the investiture will no longer be accessible. it is said to be impossible to create gemstones (i.e. polestones) with a soulcaster, although it is possible to create non-polestone crystals like quartz. apart from those edge cases, any object can be soulcast, although what it can be soulcast into varies. it's much easier to create the ten essences than other materials; for example, fruit juice would be harder to make than blood. materials that do not exist naturally, such as plastic, are possible to soulcast into, provided the closest possible essence is identified. this being said, a major limitation is the knowledge of the end material - while a surgebinder could soulcast matter into radioactive particles such as plutonium, modern-day rosharans are unaware of its existence and nature. moreover, when soulcasting, both surgebinders and fabrial users are limited by the types of gems available to them. while the chemical composition of the gemstone is important, its color is paramount, with every color of a gemstone corresponding to one of the ten essences. a gemstone that has been bleached of color - for example, by awakening - would work very poorly, or not work at all. by contrast, within a highstorm, a surgebinder can create almost anything. soulcasters[edit] fabrials[edit] in the present day, most of soulcasting is performed by fabrials called soulcasters. the fabrials are composed of two rings and a bracelet, connected by a set of chains over the back of the hand, holding a trio of gemstones. it seems to be typically worn on the freehand (right hand), although whether this is necessary is uncertain. each gemstone corresponds to one of the ten essences, allowing for the soulcaster to transform matter into one of the three. when soulcasting, the fabrial draws stormlight from the corresponding gemstone. what essences the soulcaster can use is referred to as the soulcaster's modes. this being said, soulcasters capable of using all three modes are rare, and a vast majority can only utilize one. soulcasters with access to the same essence can work together to soulcast objects of greater size. even apart from the mode limitation, soulcasting fabrials are far more limited than surgebinders, with far less variety in what they can create within the confines of the ten essences. this being said, their capacities remain somewhat broad -- for example, any liquid that is water-soluble can be soulcast with a soulcaster attuned to the essence of blood. operation[edit] supposedly, operating a soulcaster is extremely simple - one needs only to press their hand against the item that should be soulcast, and tap the appropriate gemstone with a finger. however, the actual mechanics appear to be more complicated. much like a surgebinder, a fabrial user's mind is drawn into shadesmar, where they must negotiate with the object they wish to transform. different strategies work better on different essences. for example, stone is stubborn, and should be coerced with freedom and movement, while air is easier to order with discipline. the person's will is reinforced by some other entity, attracted to the user's request for aid -- possibly the fabrial itself. humming is said to make the process easier, and soulcasters can be seen chanting during their work. creation and spread[edit] soulcasters were created before the modern age of humans on roshar, and their fabrication and origin is largely unknown until the occupation of urithiru. in the west, it's believed that soulcasters originally came from the island of akinah in the land of aimia. vorin teachings claim that they came from the almighty, through the knights radiant. current artifabrians don't understand and can't replicate soulcasters because they somehow function without trapped spren. however, the presence that can be felt by its user is similar to what occurs with the oathgate spren. during the occupation of urithiru by raboniel's forces, navani discovers that soulcasters are spren manifesting in the physical realm as a device, similar to shardblades. where the soulcasters can be found is uneven. nations like alethkar possess numerous ones, capable of creating materials such as grain or stone. other states, like azir, have very few, while places like liafor have only one. countries such as iri, rira and kharbranth have none whatsoever. uses[edit] religious significance[edit] soulcasters are extremely valuable for their various applications. vorinism considers them to be holy, despite the betrayal of the knights radiant from whom they supposedly originated, because of how useful they are. in the vorin countries, the use of soulcasters is restricted to the ardents and performed in extreme secrecy, either under the cover of night or with curtains set up to hide the happenings within. high-ranking lighteyes are often soulcast into stone after death, so that they may be preserved forever. such funerals are the only times where soulcasting is performed publicly. food production[edit] the most important function of soulcasters is food production -- fittingly, most soulcasters to have survived to the present day are capable of producing either grain or flesh. the existence of soulcasters enables the existence of large armies that the rosharan logistics would not normally allow for, as any material around, such as rocks or waste, can be soulcast into food so long the fabrials can replenish stormlight. even static settlements, such as kholinar or the shattered plains warcamps, depend on soulcasting to provide some of their food. as the gemstones break with use, farming for emeralds -- used for soulcasting grain -- is a crucial element of rosharan economy, with animals such as gumfrems and chasmfiends being either domesticated or hunted for their emerald gemhearts rather than their own meat. combat[edit] in close-range combat, soulcasters can kill their opponent by soulcasting their body into anything else, though normally, this is strictly forbidden to fabrial users. it appears that elsecallers are capable of doing so at a considerable distance, without the need for physical contact. similarly, it appears those who come into contact with a person soulcast by an elsecaller can likewise become transformed into the same material. other uses[edit] soulcasting is useful in engineering and construction. many items or buildings on roshar are first constructed out of light and easy-to-shape materials, such as wood or wax, and then soulcast into more durable substances. conversely, luxury items and objects can be made by soulcasting a common, simple substance into something more lavish or complex. soulcasting also alleviates the need for proper plumbing, as waste can be disposed of by soulcasting it into another, more useful material. in medicine, soulcasting can be used to treat poisoning by transforming the blood into its pure version. soulcast blood can also be used for transfusion for any person, as it corresponds to blood from a human universal donor. this being said, soulcast meat is not human flesh. soulcasting can also be used to obtain materials that are difficult to mine, such as metals. shinovar only purchases iron created through soulcasting, due to their perception of stone as sacred, and therefore mining as sacrilegious. it's also possible that the only way to obtain aluminium natively on roshar is through soulcasting, as there are a few soulcasters capable of creating aluminum. savants[edit] long-term use of soulcasting, whether via surgebinding or a fabrial, can lead to the user becoming a savant, transforming slowly into the essence they frequently transform other objects into. the effects of savanthood are much less pronounced for surgebinders and can take a different path in their manifestation, due to the nahel bond. this process is different from simply having transformed a portion of oneself accidentally. some soulcaster ardents on the shattered plains developed crystalline eyes and stone-like skin with cracks. another ardent in kholinar appears as if there are vines growing under her skin and poking out from her eyes. kaza is slowly becoming smoke in places, to the point where she has a hole in her cheek leaking smoke. her hair, ears and fingers have also started to transform. the personality of the soulcaster might also be affected, as kaza feels drawn to become smoke with the objects she transforms, and begins to lose normal human emotional responses. known fabrial soulcasters[edit] - - . - highmarshall - captured soulcaster (likely controlled by the - now). - royal soulcaster (used by kaza, a runaway from the royal family). - (fake). - maintains a monopoly on all soulcasters in alethkar, and charges fees for their use. - the - have a few soulcasters, including one famous for its ability to make bronze. - the - has access to at least one

for wood) and three of uncertain type were given to alethkar (it is unclear if the smoke soulcaster is the liaforan fabrial). trivia[edit] - soulcast blood matches someone's dna. - an early version of soulcasting had it available to all orders of knights radiant. a knight could only transform the material corresponding to their order, but they could transform it into anything. this was eventually changed, as it made orders feel too similar to one another. - pattern has claimed that shallan used ""the power of transformation"" to change a group of bandits into good people. it is unclear if this is some form of soulcasting or if cryptics simply have a different understanding of the surges. - the - indicate that soulcasters are ""practically useless"" to their kind. the reason for this is

Sunheart,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sunheart,"""“i need to understand your power sources. these sunhearts . . . they aren’t quite like anything i’ve seen on any other planet. ”-nomad"" sunhearts, known as cinderhearts when corrupted, are a form of investiture on canticle. acquisition and properties[edit] sunhearts are made from people who are condensed into power cells while being between canticle's sun and the core of the planet. how much energy a sunheart is made with depends on how invested the person was, but most of the energy comes from the superheated energy of canticle's sun transferring to the planet's core and the person's soul resisting that energy. those made from threnodites on canticle are made with at least two hundred breath equivalent units. a normal threnodite from canticle has only one beu, which suggest that for every one beu a person has, two hundred beus of investiture from the sun fills the sunheart. sunhearts are cylindrical lumps of smokestone eight inches (~20.5 cm) tall and a few in diameter, and feel like glass. they emit a deep red light. sunhearts can be broken apart like resin and each piece will continue to glow. once depleted, they resemble dark glass or gemstones, with bumps on their surface. some sections can resemble a screaming face. despite their condensed heat, they can be carried safely. they will float to the top of magma. charged sunhearts are considered alive by the reckoning of investiture. energy[edit] sunhearts are stable forms of condensed energy and are able to act as batteries or fuel. this can be strong enough to power entire cities. once all of the energy has been expended, the core will dim. heat and investiture can be transferred in or out of a sunheart, though a connection to the person who made it is required to transfer energy into it. when taking in investiture, sunhearts will filter and purify it and will take corrupted or undesired investiture first. recharging[edit] ""“bold one on the threshold of death, take into your sunheart my heat, that i may bless those who still live. ”-rebeke reciting the prayer to transfer investiture into a sunheart"" if not depleted, sunhearts can be given a small amount of investiture, but this normally doesn't give it a substantial amount of investiture. if a depleted sunheart is left back into the sun of canticle, it will not recharge as the investiture just passes through the sunheart, instead of being captured by it. if there is still investiture in them, sunhearts can be recharged in the sun, since the soul is resisting the investiture, causing it to flare and be captured in the sunheart. cinderhearts[edit] cinderhearts are corrupted sunhearts made from a special investiture. these can be used to create charred by stabbing a person in the chest with it. once the cinderheart is inserted heat will begin to flare, causing sparks and flames to spray out as the body is burned. the person's pectorals, rib cage, and heart will burn away, leaving seared and blackened skin. the cinderheart will then radiate from the center of the cavity. through their cinderhearts, all charred are connected, and can feel the presence of other charred. cinderhearts devour the charred's identity and connection in a manner similar to yelig-nar. cinderhearts resemble a glowing ember that emits a bright light. if the corruption is removed from a cinderheart, they will glow a soft red-orange. when a cinderheart burns something, it will continue to smolder for a long time. usage[edit] sunhearts are used by the people of canticle to power their cities and to an extent, all their individual ships. it’s also likely they use sunhearts to power their guns. sunhearts can also be used as explosives, which can be strong enough to destroy a ship. sunhearts can have slivers shaved off, which keep some investiture and can still be used as a power source. charred can use sunhearts to store a little bit of their investiture, making them more independent and able to think logically. notes[edit]"
Reen,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Reen,"""“when you're alone, no one can betray you. ”-reen"" reen is a skaa orphan from luthadel on scadrial. he lived with his half sister vin, his mother and vin's sister until he discovered that vin's sister had been murdered by their mother. the two lived on the streets and worked in the underground, until eventually coming to work in camon's crew. appearance and personality[edit] not much is known about reen's appearance, however; reen is a brutal individual, who often beats vin for little or no reason, though he claims it is to toughen her up. he trusts no one, and is not hesitant about drilling this idea into vin as well. though reen is frequently violent and harsh toward vin, he does care, as he saved her from their mother, and protected her from being found by the obligators. history[edit] he was half brother to vin and looked after her in their childhood. he raised vin to be wary of everything and trust no one, including himself, always claiming that he would betray her in the end. later, he was captured by the steel inquisitors, but he never revealed vin's existence; despite being tortured day and night, he insisted that she had starved to death years ago. reen and vin originally lived with their mother, who was the parent they both shared. after the death of vin's sister by her mother's hands, reen left with vin to earn a living in the skaa underground. the pair traveled with different crews around various towns and cities in the central dominance. when reen left vin, they were serving in camon's crew in luthadel. camon claimed that reen owed him a large sum of money, though the reason behind this is unknown. throughout her life vin was plagued by reen's voice, which advised her against trusting in anyone. although many times, she simply would remember reen's constant warning about trusting others. during the siege of fadrex city, vin discovers, through a conversation with the shard himself, that ruin was responsible for the frequent ""whispers"" in her head from reen's voice. ruin accomplished this by speaking to her via her hemalurgically charged earring. quotes[edit] notes[edit]"
Yoki-hijo,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Yoki-hijo,"yoki-hijo, a term meaning ""'girl of commanding primal spirits'"", are highly invested individuals on komashi who are able to summon spirits, through artistic rock stacking, and bind them into useful tools. they are also sometimes called chosen. becoming a yoki-hijo[edit] given the meaning of the name itself, only women are known to become yoki-hijo. these women become yoki-hijo at birth--supposedly they are chosen by the hijo, though the occurrence may be random. their nature is indicated by an omen, such as a shooting star, observed at the time of their birth. very few women are selected to become yoki-hijo--there are never more than sixteen at a given time, with no more than one chosen per year. at the time the father machine was activated, only fourteen yoki-hijo existed. no new yoki-hijo were born after the activation of the father machine. following the machine's destruction, yumi is the only one still living. though the yoki-hijo who are part of the reform movement insist on retiring at the age of seventy, and in some cases they allegedly may have been forced to serve in captivity, yoki-hijo retain their nature through the end of their lives. abilities[edit] at some point, whether before birth or after, the yoki-hijo becomes uniquely invested. this investiture enables them to summon the hijo and bind them into useful tools. that process expends some of their own investiture, though with time and rest the investiture is recovered. hijo are also able to hear the thoughts of yoki-hijo. yoki-hijo are able to do magical things other than binding hijos. they can also consume or affect raw investiture. yumi is observed by design to be invested on the same level as an elantrian, though the yoki-hijo who were killed by the father machine gained more investiture than normal over the millenniums. wardens[edit] yoki-hijo are assigned a kihomaban, or warden, to act as a guardian and sponsor. girls who become yoki-hijo are traditionally taken from their parents as a baby, and their warden is effectively a second parent, though those who are part of the reform movement do maintain contact and visit their families for a few weeks each year. the kihomaban is also responsible for the girl's training, both in the rituals and customs she must follow as well as the skills necessary to perform her duties. they are taught to read, for example, so that they can learn the required prayers. when they begin to train on stacking stones, they may spend several months simply learning to study the rocks to evaluate their shapes, weights, and centers of balance. the next phase of training involves learning to create low stacks on a stable foundation. wardens have superiors that they report to, and may be removed from duty. these same superiors may also declare a yoki-hijo unfit for duty and take punitive actions against her, though this is unlikely to be the case for those part of the reform movement. duties and rituals[edit] generally speaking, yoki-hijo travel around torio by wagon, visiting a new town each day and moving at night. their ultimate purpose is to summon the local hijo and bind them into devices that the villagers need for survival. traditionally, yoki-hijo are responsible for fulfilling countless duties and rituals on a daily basis. nearly every part of their lives has some ritualized aspect. in addition to their warden, the yoki-hijo are assigned attendants who assist with these rituals. the attendants are responsible for feeding, washing, undressing and dressing their yoki-hijo, among other things. reformed yoki-hijo do perform some of these activities for themselves, however, and may take days off for rest or other personal reasons. as with the yoki-hijo, wardens and attendants have certain customs and rituals that they perform, such as the wearing of a specific clothing each day. personal care[edit] a yoki-hijo's day begins with ritual eating, bathing, and dressing. the attendants enter the woman's room when she awakens and set up a table for breakfast, then proceed to feed the woman themselves. after breakfast, the yoki-hijo proceeds to the town's cold spring, which is reserved for the chosen while she is in town, or to the town's bath house if they do not have a spring. on the way, the attendants use enormous fans to block the villagers' view of the yoki-hijo. the attendants undress the woman as well as themselves, then bathe their yoki-hijo using seven different soaps. the soaps themselves are placed on a floating plate, and while some are for cleansing--such as a red, exfoliating powder--many of them are actually perfume creams and moisturizers. each washing is followed by a rinse, following the pattern of the artist's sequence of progress: they begin with one wash and rinse with the first soap, and end with thirteen washes and rinses with the seventh. after this, the yoki-hijo takes a final rinse, remaining 144 seconds underwater before resurfacing. with the washing complete, the attendants leave to dress themselves and prepare the yoki-hijo's clothing, giving the woman some time alone. when she exits the spring, the attendants clothe her in the designated ritual tobok. at the end of the day, attendants again help her to undress and clothe her in a thin nightgown underdress as well as a bulky, formal sleeping gown. the attendants also place a circle of flower petals around her at night, along with a ring of seeds for good luck. prayer and meditation[edit] after the morning rituals are performed, the yoki-hijo traditionally moves on to the town's shrine, again obscured from view by fronds. here she prays several ritual prayers. there are thirteen in total, though only six are considered strictly necessary and these require half an hour to say. after prayers, the yoki-hijo takes time to clear her mind and meditate. this whole process typically takes around one hour. the woman's warden approaches when the time for meditation is over, and while they might elect to continue on sooner, they typically wait for the local steamwell to erupt first. stacking stones[edit] with prayers and meditations complete, the yoki-hijo leaves the shrine and heads toward the place of ritual, called the kimomakkin in the torish language, where the hijo are summoned. most villages only have one, and the area is sometimes fenced around. she makes this journey uncovered so that villagers may see her. the locals gather rocks over time, placing them in the place of ritual for a yoki-hijo to use when she visits the town. as the chosen enters the place of ritual, villagers gather and spirit scribes sing songs and play music that involves chanting, drums, and flutes. the stone at the place of ritual is hotter than usual, so the yoki-hijo puts on kneepads to make her work easier. the yoki-hijo works for several hours, stacking stones in complex arrangements that draw the interest of the nearby spirits. typically in one session they will build several dozen stacks, each one comprised of thirty or more stones. in some cases, shorter but more complex stacks may be used. most yoki-hijo summon six to ten spirits on average. during her lifetime, yumi was able to summon twelve spirits per session on average, and once managed twenty spirits. as the hijo are drawn to her, the chosen feels a tugging sensation. after finishing her stacks, the yoki-hijo directs her attention to binding the spirits. she must be careful to proceed to this step before falling unconscious from exhaustion. the local spirit scribes develop an ordered list of supplicants with the greatest need, who are directed to approach the yoki-hijo one at a time to make their request. the yoki-hijo uses the summoned spirits to fulfill these, turning to each one and sharing the request while forming an impression in her mind. if the impression is not clear, the spirit may become confused or frightened and leave. after each available spirit has been bound, the yoki-hijo's duties are completed, and her attendants return her to their wagon. culture[edit] in torish culture, yoki-hijo are very highly respected, with few having greater authority. their position is seen as one of service to the people--they are served so that they may serve others. it is considered rude to contradict a yoki-hijo, even to give a compliment. while the various rituals and expectations placed upon them (thought to be decreed by the spirits) have traditionally limited their personal freedoms, those who are part of the reform movement exercise greater autonomy. this movement began several hundred years prior to the activation of the machine, and nearly all of the yoki-hijo--twelve--subscribed to it at that time, with only yumi and one other remaining orthodox. some stories tell of yoki-hijo falling in love, though it is unknown if even reformed yoki-hijo develop romantic relationships. known

Battle of Alta Second,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Battle_of_Alta_Second,"the battle of alta second occurs on the day of skyward flight's graduation. background[edit] the battle of alta second started in a small room in the defiant defense force's flight command building, as admiral judy ivans and her aide-de-camp rikolfr informed national assembly leaders algernon weight, valda mendez, and ukrit that a large chunk of falling debris, containing hundreds of acclivity rings, would be disarmed within two days. she and the national assembly leaders knew the hard truth - the ddf would continue to spiral towards collapse unless they could find a way to field more starfighters than the krell. knowing a better opportunity might not come while they had the strength they had, the national assembly leaders and the admiral agreed to throw all ddf ships at capturing the acclivity rings. battle at the shipyard[edit] ""ironsides: ""cloak? nice work. "" fm: ""she's dead. this is callsign: fm. cloak died in the blast. there are...sir, there are three of us left in the scout flight. the others died in the fighting. "" ironsides: ""confirmed. stars accept their souls. "" ―ironsides and fm."" the battle begins as soon as the ddf flight school graduation is over, as the ddf quickly launches eleven full flights and five scouting trios, totaling eighty-seven pilots. the ddf also calls in all of its reserves from the deep caverns. the pilots approached the shipyard and ironsides asks the scouting trios for fighter estimates on the krell. the scouting trios determine that a first wave of krell contains fifty starfighters, while a second wave carries another fifty starfighters. both sides understand the titanic consequences the battle would have. ""“eighy-seven brave pilots are making their way to engage the krell to rescue the salvage. victory will bring our league unprecedented glory and spoils.”-radio announcer to the people of igneous cavern."" ironsides orders riptide, valkyrie, tungsten, and nightmare flights to provide cover fire for the inside flights protecting the shipyard from a krell bombing. one of the flightleaders reports a bomber, with a confirmation from three other ships. scout cloak gives a scouting confirmation, and ironsides orders the pilots to drive it away, at the risk of pushing it towards alta base, more than two hours away. one of the flightleaders tells ironsides that they had the lifebuster on the run, but that it was headed towards alta. cloak informs ironsides that the bomber is faster than most, so ironsides orders the scouting contingents to move to intercept the lifebuster. the flightleader of valkyrie flight tells ironsides they are down to three pilots and request support, only for their line to go short. another pilot tells ironsides that valkyrie flight would be absorbed into their flight. ironsides then orders a full offensive to protect the shipyard, and all the flightleaders give a verbal confirmation. cloak tells ironsides that the bomber is moving extremely fast, has an escort of ten ships, and could easily get in blast range of alta base, so ironsides orders her to engage it with just her flight of twelve scouts. both the battle at the shipyard and around the bomber continue for some time, before cloak finally reports that the bomber had been destroyed and that the lifebuster was falling to the ground and ordered all of the scouts to get clear before it exploded. it hits close enough to alta base that spensa could hear the explosions from underground in igneous cavern; after it exploded, ironsides congratulates cloak, only to be told by fm that cloak didn't make it out of the blast and that only three scouts survived. ironsides then orders the three survivors to return to the battle at the shipyard. second lifebuster[edit] shortly thereafter, a woman from antiaircraft gun outpost fourth-seven reports that it, as well as outposts fourth-six and fourth-eight, have been hit by the lifebuster blast and are destroyed. the gunner who gave the report then asks ironsides if she had a nearby debris fall on her radar. the gunner takes out a pair of binoculars and reports multiple krell ships dropping through the debris field, right over the destroyed antiaircraft gun outposts. the gunner tells ironsides to scramble the reserves, not knowing all the reserves are out fighting at the shipyard. ironsides orders riptide flight to return to alta base immediately, but their flightleader informs her that even at mag-10 it would take over thirty minutes. ignoring the defect, spensa runs to the ddf hangars and asks dorgo if she can fly arturo's ship, skyward five. he tells her it is barely functional, no shields and poor steering, but it has destructors and ejection. spensa gets in the ship and takes off for the rogue lifebuster. admiral ironsides stands in command room, watching a hologram of the fifteen krell ships, lifebuster included, approach alta base unopposed. suddenly, rising from the hangars appears a single red dot, who flight command confirms is skyward ten: spensa. ironsides gives spensa a heading for the krell force, eight minutes away from the death zone, telling spensa she can make it in two. spensa tells her she might have a few reinforcements coming, and heads towards the force without a shield. ""“my weapons are gone.”-spensa, to ironsides."" spensa gets a visual confirmation on the lifebuster, so ironsides gives her the order to shoot it down, regardless of how close it is to alta base. spensa engages and immediately gains twelve tails. they chase her around, trying to draw her away from the lifebuster, but she stays focused and scores a few hits on the bomber, which its shield absorbs. she continues dogfighting with the escort, and finds that she can faintly hear the commands being sent to the krell ships and is able to react to them before the krell. ""“understood. saints' own speed, pilot.”-ironsides, to spensa."" all of the junior admirals gather around ironsides, gazes locked on the hologram of spensa weaving in and out of destructor blasts. all of the remaining flights have been disengaged from the battle at the shipyard, and are on their way back to alta base. they knew they would be too late, so all of alta and igneous' hopes rode on spensa. spensa counts five hits on the lifebuster when jorgen contacts her via the general comm line. he asks how she's doing and informs her that he is with riptide flight, streaking toward alta base at mag-10. suddenly, spensa gets hit, on the nose of her ship, disabling her destructors. the shot came from one of the sleek black ships whose commands she can't hear. ironsides informs spensa she has full authority to shoot the ship down even if it reaches the death zone. the lifebuster is one minute away from the death zone, and with no weapons, spensa resolves to kamikaze into the lifebuster. ironsides asks what she is doing, and spensa informs her of her weapons malfunction. ironsides understands and gives her a solemn word of good luck. spensa streaks toward the lifebuster, nose still on fire, when her battered ship finally gives out. the acclivity rings on the bottom of her ship give out, and she undershoots the lifebuster and starts spiraling towards the ground. return of m-bot[edit] instead of ejecting, spensa is able to control her starfighter and guide it to the ground. she skids into the ground just as arturo informs ironsides that he, nedd, and kimmalyn have successfully stolen their parents' private craft and are headed toward the krell. flight command informs spensa that a krell ship is coming to destroy her wreckage, but she tells them she's stuck in her straps. the krell ship opens fire, only for its destructor blasts to be blocked by the shield of a w-shaped large fighter, m-bot. cobb calls into flight command as mongrel and tells spensa to hang on. cobb slams the krell into the ground using m-bot's light-lance, then skims towards spensa's ship. cobb gets out and helps spensa out of her ship, then tells her she has to fly m-bot and go take out the bomber. spensa tells him she could hear the krell commands, so he tells her to ignore the defect, that she isn't predestined to destroy the ddf, but that she can choose to save it. m-bot tells spensa he rewrote his code to identify spensa as his pilot, thus forcing him to follow the commands of his new pilot and fight. spensa gets in m-bot and fires up his systems, everything but his stealth mode, so the krell will see her coming. ""“it was a simple program. it edited one entry in a database, while i wasn't looking, replacing one name with another. i must follow the commands of my pilot.”-m-bot, telling spensa how he rewrote his code to make her his pilot."" several powerful families inform ironsides that they are escaping as the last line of emergency gun emplacements inform her that the krell fighters are coming close to engage them. she then makes contact with arturo, ordering him to shoot down the lifebuster, regardless of the effect it might have on alta base. he gives confirmation, just as rikolfr informs ironsides of an unidentified fighter approaching the battle at mag-20. spensa then identifies herself over the comm line as skyward eleven. spensa speeds towards the lifebuster in m-bot, his shield lit up due to the heat of air resistance, as he informs her that all of his systems but cytonic hyperdrive, self-repair, and destructors are online. spensa connects with kimmalyn and nedd over the general comm line, informing them of her talking ship's capabilities. spensa then flies through the center of the krell force and immediately gains a tail of thirteen ships. nedd tells spensa that riptide flight is a minute and a half away, so spensa tells him she'd distract most of the krell, but she needs nedd and kimmalyn to try to drive away the lifebuster. ironsides tells her to shoot it on sight, but spensa tells her they might not need to do so. spensa dove through the krell, dodging their destructor blasts, anticipating their movements before they made them, even able to feel the lines of electricity giving orders through m-bot's fuselage. when the lifebuster reaches two minutes away, the flightleader of riptide flight, terrier, calls in through the general comm line, asking who spensa is. jorgen tells him it doesn't matter, and spensa tells him to focus everything he has on taking out the three black krell interceptors. fm and jorgen fly close to the bomber, activating an imp to bring its shield down, and kimmalyn fires a destructor blast on the exact spot holding the bomb to the ship. the ship keeps flying, but the bomb falls out. all of the fighters, ddf and krell, overburn out, except spensa. ironsides and her junior admirals sit in the command room, weeping and praying as the lifebuster falls towards the ground. all the starfighters but one speed away from the bomb. spensa spears the bomb with her light-lance and shoots away at mag-16, passing through a group of ddf pilots. m-bot calculates that they would make it outside the death zone of alta base, but that they would be in the middle of the blast. spensa sinks into the ship, feeling m-bot's processors, then m-bot tells her that his biological component has been engaged and that his cytonic hyperdrive is online. spensa engages the hyperdrive and shoots away from the blast in a blink. aftermath[edit] spensa enters a place of complete darkness, with billions of white eyes watching her, then comes to. m-bot tells her they are one hundred kilometers from the blast, with no evidence of time dilation. ironsides contacts spensa and tells her to come back to base, but, seeing a gap in the debris field, spensa rotates her acclivity rings and launches upwards, towards the stars. spensa and m-bot fly up towards the gap in the platforms, eventually leaving the exosphere and reaching mag-55. m-bot informs her he is detecting radio communication at one of the stars ahead, believing it to not be a star, but a space station. a few krell ships come close to m-bot and spensa is suddenly overcome with something pushing on her brain and eyes, trying to make her see certain images. spensa realizes this is exactly what the krell must have done to her father, make him see his friends as krell and therefore shoot them down. m-bot then jams their transmission, then pulls back a little bit, allowing spensa to hear the krell talking to each other. she learned the krell are actually just prison guards, and m-bot tries to hack the space station's systems. he tries but is booted out, so the space station deploys a couple fighters to attack them. m-bot and spensa flee back through the gap in the platforms, but not before m-bot gains some information from the station. after the battle, and with help from spensa's cytonics and rodge and the engineering corps' work, the ddf is able to seize control of a couple of the platforms above detritus, reenergizing and reequipping them, and taking the fight to the krell outside the atmosphere of detritus. notable combatants[edit] notes[edit]"
Battle of Alta,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Battle_of_Alta,"the battle of alta took place above alta base when spensa was seven years old. forty human starfighters participated, against one hundred krell fighters, the largest force the krell have ever sent against the humans. of the participants, fourteen survived and twenty six (including chaser) died. history[edit] prior to the battle, alta base had been cloaked to hide it from the krell, in an attempt to build up a defense force against the aliens using the machinery that had been found beneath the base in igneous cavern. chaser and spensa were in a cave on the surface of detritus when chaser spotted dozens of pieces of debris falling through the atmosphere, headed toward alta base. he reported it to flight command, and they told him that they had seen the same thing, their radar reports telling them the debris was actually a large force of krell starfighters. flight command told chaser the krell were heading straight toward igneous cavern, and mongrel contacted him, telling him to convince banks and swing to stay and fight. they wanted to abandon the cavern, but ironsides demanded that they stay and fight. chaser agreed with ironsides, and said if humans had any hope of having a civilization again, they needed to stay and defend igneous. mongrel told chaser he would beat him to the air and kill more krell than him, so chaser sprints toward alta base to fight the krell. ""“some wounds aren't as obvious as a twisted leg. you found it hard to get into the cockpit today, after watching your friends die? try doing it after you shoot down one of your own.”-cobb, to spensa, explaining why he doesn't fly anymore."" the humans flew into the sky in waves, totaling forty pilots, compared to the krell's one hundred. the krell ships were poorly constructed, with wires coming out at odd angles and ripped wings. the battle devolved into a chaotic mess, each pair of wingmates fighting to survive against the much larger force of the krell. chaser killed many krell, at times seeming to know what turns the krell were going to make before they made them. him and mongrel were a well-oiled machine, one of them would fire an imp on a group of krell, and the other would pick them off, outside the distance of the imp. the battle went on for upwards of an hour. chaser, mongrel, ironsides, rally and antique formed up, the last surviving members of hope flight, as the krell seemed to be retreating. cobb asked if the krell were retreating, and chaser told him they were merely regrouping. cobb and chaser returned to ironsides, and earned a brief recess from the combat. cobb and ironsides engaged in some banter about chaser, then cobb pointed out a hole in the debris field that revealed the stars. they lost chaser's attention for a minute, so cobb asked if everything was alright, while ironsides asked if it was the defect. chaser told her he could control the defect, but that he believed he could get through the hole and reach the stars. ironsides told him to stay in rank, but he told her he could hear the stars like never before. she told him she trusted him, and let him go. chaser rotated his ship, pointed his acclivity rings at the ground, and boosted towards the hole. chaser went above the protective platforms of detritus, and without jamming technology equipped in his ship, fell under the influence of the krell, so returned to the fighting, bent on killing the humans. chaser returned from above the debris field, immediately going after members of hope flight, first activating his imp, then shooting down rally and antique. ironsides and mongrel fell in together and went after him. cobb took a shot at chaser, which he dodged, but cobb got another shot off and blew up chaser's ship. after more fighting, the humans were finally victorious and the krell truly retreated. the battle ended with fourteen survivors out of the original forty pilots. despite chaser's actions, the ddf won the battle, chasing off the krell and saving alta base. following the battle they removed the cloaking from alta base and further fortified their position. legacy[edit] chaser's actions led to him being branded a coward. this was specifically engineered by ironsides as she believed it better he be branded a coward than a traitor. while his flightmates did not know exactly why he had turned on them, ironsides knew it to be related to his cytonic abilities, known by high level defiant cavern officials as the ""defect"". her view of the defect changed entirely following the battle and when chasers daughter spensa tried to apply for flight school, she refused her entry, by purposely giving spensa an exam she could not complete. spensa was eventually accepted into flight school, with the help of cobb, where she was able to rewatch the battle, learning the truth of her fathers actions. those who fought in the battle are called the first citizens, and are given special privileges. this includes special quarters and influence, and their children are given a free entrance into flight school should they decide to go. known participants[edit] notes[edit]"
Harmonium,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ettmetal,"harmonium, also known as ettmetal, is the god metal of harmony. it is used in some of the southern scadrians' metallic arts technologies. properties[edit] harmonium is the condensed elemental form of harmony's power. alloying atium and lerasium will not produce harmonium. while difficult, it is possible to obtain atium and lerasium from harmonium, but not through mechanical means. storing too much harmonium in one place supposedly can lead to the production of a perpendicularity, due to the large concentration of investiture. due to this, the south scadrians make it a rule to never store too much harmonium together. chemical properties[edit] due to the merging of ruin and preservation's intents into harmony, harmonium's spiritual aspect is in opposition with itself, leading to effects on the metal's physical aspect, which makes it extremely reactive. it reacts violently with water, similar to alkali metals. after reacting with water, residual harmonium hydroxide is left behind, though the substance's properties are unknown. the southern scadrians use harmonium to create powerful bombs, which the set have been trying to replicate with limited success. harmonium corrodes and can react strongly in contact with the air; in order to prevent this, it is stored within oil. it does not react with acids. it is soft and pliable like gold, especially when heated via flame or electricity. when heated by electricity and slowly drawn apart, a nugget of harmonium begins to separate, with the two parts beginning to take on the traits of atium and lerasium. however, when the string of metal between them is cut, both sides return to being mere harmonium. it has an extraordinarily high melting point, above 3,000 degrees. when heated, it lets off a full spectrum of light, with an unknown color of the spectrum going off the spectrometric scale. reaction to trellium[edit] when harmonium has electric currents moving passing through it the metal softens and can be split in half. if, during this process, trellium is inserted between the two pieces a violent reaction occurs as the matter of both metals are converted into pure energy. this reaction is not complete, only converting a small fraction of the used metals into energy. the blast is powerful enough that not even autonomy or harmony are aware as to how strong an explosion of it can be. minor fragments of lerasium and atium are also produced by this reaction. harmonium and trellium repel each other, with the strength of repulsion becoming stronger the closer they are forced together. metallic arts[edit] the allomantic, feruchemical, and hemalurgic properties of harmonium are unknown. because of its volatile nature near water, ingesting harmonium is likely to be fatal for allomancers, though a full mistborn who is also able to heal through the explosive damage (e.g., by compounding feruchemical gold for health) could burn it for some effect. hemalurgic spikes would also likely be difficult to create, due to the metal's reactivity; however, it is not impossible. mechanical uses[edit] in conjunction with southern scadrian technology, harmonium can reproduce allomantic or feruchemical powers within its vicinity. the southern scadrians have also used the metal in primer cubes which can somehow regulate harmonium's effects with the flip of a switch. when used allomantically, the metal is said to burn ""with a pure whiteness"" and will slowly be consumed, in the same way it would be by a misting or mistborn. it is used to fuel southern scadrian allomantic technology, including their airships that run via steelpushing. it is theoretically possible to use a primer cube to reproduce other investitures, such as surgebinding. trivia[edit] - if harmonium followed the naming conventions of the other god metals it would have been named - . however, - didn't like the sound of it. - has described harmonium as ""super-cesium"" in reference to its violent chemical reaction with water. - - , like other real-life - , is extremely reactive and will cause an explosion with water even at sub-zero temperatures. he later clarified that cesium was not intended as a direct analogue; harmonium would theoretically be classified as an alkali metal, although it has a different melting point. - the mistborn metal dice set from crafty games lists a non-canonical description of harmonium's properties, stating ""unknown in the classic era, harmonium replicates the effects of nearby allomantic or feruchemical metals."" it also lists harmonium as an internal and pushing god metal. notes[edit]"

Shuden,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Shuden,"baron shuden is a jindo merchant in arelon on sel. his family directed many trade routes around arelon. they were offered a barony by iadon to keep their caravans running. attributes and abilities[edit] he is a known amateur practitioner of chayshan. when using chayshan, shuden repeatedly performs certain movements that serve as the key to the dor. this gives him ever-increasing strength and speed, enough to break the bones of a dakhor monk. if his movement is interrupted, he loses access to the dor and his increased physical powers. history[edit] shuden was part of raoden's group that conspired against king iadon, being one of the few members willing to meet up after raoden's mysterious and sudden ""death."" he spoke in favour of allowing sarene to attend the meeting and as she became the leader of the group, he and eondel were most vocal in their loyalty to her whereas ahan and roial saw her as an equal partner. shuden, as a handsome wealthy bachelor, was frustrated with the unwanted attention he got from the ladies around the court. he was happy to bring sarene as his guest to parties as it put many of the ladies attentions off. during sarene's fencing classes with the ladies he performed chayshan and sarene believed that despite his protests he actually quite liked the attention. following torena beginning the fencing classes, she and shuden began courting each other, which the others found humourous given shuden's previous aversion to romance. he and eondel were closest friends, both sharing a devotion to sarene and a similar strong sense of honor and decorum. in the span of a few days, ahan betrayed them, telrii had roial killed and eondel died killing telrii. sarene noted that shuden took the events particularly hard since his future father-in-law was the traitor, torena disappeared shortly afterwards, and his best friend died. during the invasion of arelon, when the citizens were rounded up for execution, shuden put on a final show of defiance by attacking the fjordell soldiers and dakhor monks with chayshan, managing to snap the neck of one of the monks. his actions inspired lukel and several of the female fencers to fight back but shuden was knocked unconscious and the others summarily defeated. they were saved by the appearance of raoden who had restored the elantrians to full power. notes[edit]"
Dereth,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Dereth,"dereth is the founder of the shu-dereth religion. though his fjordell name is more well-known in modern times, his original jindo name is dehwo. dereth lived in jindo anciently and studied as a disciple of keseg along with korath. keseg taught dereth and his other disciples about unity, founding the shu-keseg religion. when dereth and korath left jindo to teach in the lands to the north, they interpreted his teachings differently, which led to the foundation of shu-dereth and shu-korath. dereth took keseg's teachings about unity to mean that people should be united through obedience. he presumably wrote the do-dereth, one of the holy books of shu-dereth, although over the years its text has been altered at least to include references to jaddeth. notes[edit]"
Korath,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Korath,"korath (kohwo) was the founder of the shu-korath religion. he was a student of keseg, who began the religion shu-keseg. keseg preached unity, and his two disciples, korath and dereth, interpreted this in different ways. dereth took it to mean unity of governance, while korath understood it as unity of love. the two split to create two different religions, shu-dereth and shu-korath. korath adopted the elantrian symbol aon omi to represent both his church and its god. this was a surprising choice, as many new followers of shu-korath considered aons and the elantrian religion to be heathen. however, by adopting the symbol, korath hoped to prove that his church should love everybody. the center of shu-korath was eventually moved to teod, after korath's death. he had a pendant with the symbol forged, which eventually evolved into the current practice of exchanging omi pendants at korathi weddings, as well as the habit of many followers of shu-korath wearing the pendants. the pendants eveventually became known as korathi pendants. notes[edit]"
Hamaradin,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Hamaradin,"brightlady hamaradin was a lighteyed member of vamah's court in alethkar on roshar. house hamaradin was known to have a spy network, and brightlady hamaradin was personally involved in these activities. ishnah claimed to have been trained as a spy for house hamaradin, learning various techniques such as information gathering and message coding. mraize investigated ishnah and found that she did indeed perform espionage for house hamaradin, but was merely an assistant rather than a true spy. at one point, ishnah overheard brightlady hamaradin talking about the ghostbloods. ishnah believed that hamaradin somehow crossed the ghostbloods and they killed her. she may have died after the alethi moved from the shattered plains to urithiru, as some of the people in house hamaradin's employ were accused of the murder and went underground there. notes[edit]"
Stagin,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Stagin,"stagin is a man from the roughs that owns a still and brews whiskey. whiskey from stagin's still was a favorite of waxillium ladrian when he was a lawman in the roughs. wax used it in his vials of allomantic steel shavings in lieu of water or some other liquid. when wax returned to elendel to take his place as leader of house ladrian after his uncle's ""death"", he bemoaned the fact that his supply of stagin's whiskey would soon run out. notes[edit]"
Pewter,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Thug,"pewter is the internal physical pushing metal. an allomancer burning pewter has increased physical strength, speed, durability, balance, and enhanced ability to heal. it allows the user to push their body far past what they would normally be able to achieve. feruchemists can use pewter to store physical strength, and, when used as a hemalurgic spike, pewter steals physical feruchemical powers. in the metallic arts, pewter is the alloy paired with tin. alloy composition[edit] the pewter used in the metallic arts is an alloy of ninety-one percent tin and nine percent lead. allomantic use[edit] a pewter misting is known as a thug or pewterarm. pewter's utility is not simply from the increased strength or speed. it grants the user the ability to heal from otherwise deadly wounds, and to recover much quicker. it will also heal conditions such as drug effects or drunkenness. aluminum in a wound will make it impossible for the thug to heal the injury around the metal for as long as it remains in the body. pewter also enhances the body's natural balance, granting almost unnaturally smooth movements. it also increases reaction speed and gives them resistance to hot and cold temperatures. pewter can theoretically be used to alter the user's appearance. finally, it increases endurance, letting the body continue on long past when it would have normally shut down. pewter can be dangerous when it runs out, which is a serious concern since it is the fastest-burning of the eight basic metals. a thug having just survived a deadly wound can die from the resulting effects when the body runs out of pewter to burn. however, the body will naturally burn pewter in an attempt to heal itself, so even an unconscious thug can be given additional pewter to survive otherwise life-threatening situations. pewter roughly doubles the average person’s strength, and triples it when flared. pewter dragging[edit] by constantly flaring pewter for a long time (pewter dragging), a thug can achieve incredible things, such as running at roughly the speed of a galloping horse for extended periods. however, this is extremely dangerous and could even be lethal when the thug stops burning pewter, even disregarding the fact that repeated pewter dragging will lead to savantism, for there is a sudden burst of intense fatigue that had been suppressed by pewter. several days of rest and sufficient food are required to replenish the thug afterwards. savantism[edit] if someone were able to burn the amount of pewter needed to become an allomantic savant with the metal, they would have enhanced physical abilities such as being able to heal more quickly, though not as fast as someone tapping health from a goldmind. thugs often die before becoming savants, as they feel neither pain nor exhaustion to any great extent and therefore may ignore wounds that later prove fatal. feruchemical use[edit] a pewter ferring is known as a brute. pewter is used to store physical strength. however, as opposed to the simply enhanced body granted to an allomancer burning pewter, a brute tapping a pewtermind gains muscle mass and becomes physically larger. the additional muscles allow the brute to have increased strength. for this reason, pewter metalminds are often designed to be able to stretch wider to accommodate the extra muscles. while storing physical strength, a brute becomes scrawny and weak. it's possible for a brute to tap so much strength that their girth makes it difficult for them to maneuver properly. compounding[edit] a pewter compounder would be able to use pewter to have a nearly infinite supply of physical strength. hemalurgic use[edit] when used as a hemalurgic spike, pewter steals physical feruchemical powers (iron, steel, tin, and pewter).[fn 1] kandra blessing[edit] the kandra can use a pair of these spikes as a blessing. like all kandra blessings, the blessing gives the mistwraiths sentience, with an unknown added benefit. fabrial use[edit] a fabrial with a pewter cage will express the element corresponding with the trapped spren, creating an augmentor fabrial. for example, a fabrial with a trapped flamespren will radiate heat. as with its use in allomancy, this consumes stormlight more quickly than other fabrials. notes[edit]"
Karshad,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Karshad,"""“ker’naisha’totar’kersha! ”-'may the sand lord bless us!' in karshad"" karshad is a holy language spoken by members of the priest daikeen, the clergy of the ker'reen religion in kerzta on taldain. when khriss and her team first arrived on dayside, she and cynder had learned some karshad by studying daysider books. when cynder spoke the language to the locals, they seemed to understand but quickly fled in fear. the darksider team then overheard a priest (possibly the a'kar) speaking karshad, and realized that they had inadvertently learned a holy language. cynder was considered to be elis's foremost authority on daysider linguistics, and his ignorance of the common language was symptomatic of the schism between the two regions. notes[edit]"
Navani Kholin,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Navani,"navani kholin is an alethi lighteyes living on roshar. she is the widow of gavilar kholin and the mother of jasnah and elhokar kholin. she was the sister-in-law to dalinar kholin and aunt to adolin and renarin kholin until she was married to dalinar. she is also a renowned scholar and artifabrian. appearance and personality[edit] appearance[edit] navani has a stately bearing and, in some ways, is the picture of a perfect vorin woman: lush lips, light violet eyes, silvering black hair in perfect braids, curves accentuated by the tight silk havah. she has a warm, feminine voice. she prefers perfume with a less floral scent than most alethi women. navani often paints her lips red and wears a red dress with rubies in her hair. like her daughter, she is known as one of the most beautiful women in alethkar. personality[edit] ""“order from chaos. find the structure here and start building upon it. ”-navani"" as the dowager queen, navani often challenges alethi protocol. she is known for her ability to learn everything of significance through gossip, no matter where she travels. she is not overly judgmental, but is not above pointing out the obvious. she is known for her confidence, to the point that she is not afraid to match words with wit. she believes in being blunt, especially when working with scholars. despite this, navani is also known for her discretion. a scholar at heart, she keeps exacting notes and is well organized. having lived much of her life as a queen, navani is a creature of politics. she is deftly able to navigate the alethi political sphere when she chooses to. however, as she has grown older, navani has become disillusioned with politics and has begun to chafe at the traditional place for a brightlady. as the dowager queen, she believes that no one cares about her actions and would pass off any extreme actions as eccentricity. despite her talent at politics, navani's true love is found in her scholarly pursuits. it is part of her belief that a brightlady should have a variety of hobbies. she is a renowned scholar, specializing in the development of new fabrials. she pursues her passion with enthusiasm and little to no guile. in addition, she is fond of simple solutions. navani believes that soul of art is creation. creation brings order to an blank slate or empty canvas and becomes art. she uses that belief to fuel her scholarly pursuits. she also likes warcamps because they are not messy like cities, and because military men and women valued order and rationality. attributes and abilities[edit] ""“she always claimed that she wasn't a scholar, but a patron of scholars. (...) anyone who saw the light in her eyes as she took out another sheet and sketched her idea further knew she was being too modest. ”-dalinar"" navani is a renowned artifabrian. she engineers the creation of fabrials that her team of artisan ardents create through fabrial science. she led the research to develop the grandbows. she also had a hand in the construction of a new painrial, and of it, she's particularly proud, though it's only an early model. she thinks it has a lot of potential. many of her inventions, such as the painrial, are used in the war against the parshendi, making her incredibly valuable to the alethi. navani is quick to discount her own scholarly abilities but is actually a brilliant systems engineer. she doesn't tend to delve deep into any single component but leads teams of scientists and engineers in multi-disciplinary projects that produce profound results. the more she understands the secrets of technology and the power of spren locked within the polestones, the closer she grows to finding what she seeks: things she can do to protect her family, like creating shardplate. navani created a platform with fabrial science that defies gravity. her goal in so doing is to deliver one such to the shattered plains to elevate archers above the battlefield for a tactical advantage. her position is patron to the ardents who make the diagrams and figures and engineer the fabrials. navani and her crew of ardents made a breakthrough with shardblades in realizing that the gemstones in the blades - used to bond them - might not have originally been part of the weapons. if true, it means the blades aren't powered by the stones. rushu had asked why a shardblade can be summoned and dismissed even if its gemstone has gone dun. if true, artifabrians are back to knowing absolutely nothing about how shardblades were crafted. it seems the gemstone's purpose is only used in initially bonding the blade - something the radiants didn't need to do. after accepting shallan, navani decided to lead the research team studying the quotes shallan had provided her from jasnah's research regarding the oathgate, knights radiant, and urithiru. navani co-opted dalinar's scribes and cartographers to locate the oathgate, leading dalinar to remark upon it to shallan. she, in turn, states that she was really just there when navani changed her mind. during the battle of narak during the weeping, navani oversees the deployment of fabrials to allow the alethi archers to join the battle. light fabrials are set up to illuminate the battlefield while half-tents are raised to provide shelter from the rain for the archers. to combat the moisture in the air, she authorizes the use of a recently-developed fabrial called an attractor, that was designed to draw water out of the air; navani was half worried the device would suck the blood out of the archers' bodies. once in urithiru, navani discovers a fabrial lift. she speaks of counterweights and conjoined gemstones, sounding awed by the technology of the ancients. surgebinding[edit] at the end of the siege of urithiru, navani forms a nahel bond with the sibling, becoming a knight radiant of the order of bondsmiths. this grants her the ability to bind the surges of tension and adhesion. she has sworn at least the first ideal, and may have sworn more than one ideal during her initial bonding of the sibling. by working in conjunction with the sibling, navani can generate vast quantities of towerlight, enough to fully power the city-fabrial of urithiru. she is also able to control and intuitively understand the functioning of urithiru and its constituent fabrials. history[edit] unification of alethkar and gavilar's reign[edit] prior to her marriage to gavilar kholin, navani wavered between choosing gavilar and his younger brother, dalinar. ultimately, she chose the future king. with him, she had two children, a daughter, jasnah, and a son, elhokar. during the unification of alethkar, navani and ialai sadeas huddled together at dinners; conspiring on how to stabilize the kingdom their husbands were trying to conquer.. they were very close friends. navani and ialai were responsible for finding dalinar a wife which would give them political advantage. during gavilar’s last days, he had gone strange. as he had grown more and more distracted, navani herself had worked to keep squabbling lighteyes from sundering the kingdom. it is uncertain how much she knew of gavilar's plans, but she was aware that he had a small gemstone that glowed with a strange light that was somehow dark, similar to the one that dalinar trapped nergaoul in. assassination of gavilar[edit] on the night of gavilar's assassination, navani was organizing the preparations for the feast, she encountered aesudan in the palace gardens, speaking to two ardents. aesudan used navani's presence as an excuse to cut the conversation short. navani then approached the palace steward, who told her that gavilar was missing from the celebration. despite her irritation with gavilar, she dealt with the guests' concerns during the feast to cover the king's absence. she eventually excused herself to find gavilar, whom she discovered in her study, speaking to nale and kalak. navani glimpsed an array of violet-black spheres, which gavilar had arranged on the table. after gavilar dismissed nale and kalak, navani expressed an interest in the spheres. gavilar's rebuke initiated an argument between them, where they discussed jasnah's failed betrothal to amaram, gavilar's disregard for her, and his plans for alethkar. when navani threatened to tarnish his legacy, gavilar insulted her and said she was no true scholar. once he left, an angry navani inscribed a glyphward praying for his death and burned it. she returned to the feast to fulfill her role as queen. following the end of the feast, navani heard that the parshendi had assassinated gavilar. although navani didn't believe what happened, the truth sank in when she saw gavilar's broken body. she felt a pang of guilt over the glyphward. however, she soon realized she pitied gavilar instead of grieving for him. navani vowed to herself that she would stay silent and let gavilar have his legacy. aftermath of the assassination[edit] after gavilar's death at the hands of szeth, navani was left without a defined position in alethi society as her son assumed the throne. in retaliation for gavilar's death, the alethi started a war against the parshendi, who claimed responsibility for the assassination. much of alethi society moved to the shattered plains to fight them. initially, she stayed in kholinar to aid elhokar's wife, aesudan, in ruling the kingdom. after some years, she moved to the shattered plains, realizing that the seat of power had transferred there as the war of reckoning continued. returning to the shattered plains[edit] navani's return to the plains from alethkar was three-fold: she brought word that the vedens had perfected the half-shards, she wishes her son to be protected, and she needs to speak with dalinar. she also realized that leaving the plains had been a political mistake because the warcamps became the true center of their kingdom. while in kholinar, she determined that that aesudan was sufficiently endowed with the requisite skills needed to hold the city. (the very argument that had originally convinced navani to return to kholinar was that the alethi absence from their homeland was dangerous.) later, she confessed to dalinar that the real reason of her return was the feeling of not having a home. the court expected to sit out of important events because her husband was dead. people believed that she would lounge around, pampered but ignored, making people uncomfortable with her presence. recording dalinar's visions[edit] because navani was so exacting in her words and thoughts, as well as the only woman in the warcamps he knew he could trust, dalinar chose her to record his visions. she scribed expertly, picking out details from him, and knowing when to prod him for more. she was business-like and careful and recorded his visions without complaint. while she listened to dalinar's visions she realized that what he was saying had too much order to be gibberish. she discovered a phrase from the analectics that matched what dalinar was babbling during his fits. she told him that it was a line from a song, a chant by the vanrial, written in the dawnchant by the heralds. navani was able to use dalinar's visions as a guide to help her scholars translate the dawnchant. navani related the myth of parasaphi and nadris to dalinar in effort to afford some insight into the desolations, with regard to his vision with nohadon, relevant to the voidbringers, mankind on roshar, damnation, the heralds, the tranquiline halls, and the knights radiant. she had kept the secret and was very reliable, however they eventually decide to publish them. before doing so, she removed the lines where he mentioned sensitive issues, such as the almighty’s death. she’d also search for historical references to match his descriptions. navani liked things neat and quantified. she’d prepared a timeline of all of his visions, trying to piece them into a single narrative. she believed the visions were a blessing because they proved that dalinar wasn't going mad. after recording several of his visions, dalinar and navani learned to trust each other and confessed their feelings for one another. navani made it clear that she would not stop for tradition, as their union wasn't explicitly forbidden. re-uniting the alethi princedoms[edit] navani helped dalinar build their first plan for unification and strength of the crown. they decided to attack on different fronts: economical (changes to the manner of collection and distribution of gemhearts on the shattered plains), fear (adolin would duel to earn shardblades) and political (dalinar and navani would try to persuade the benefits of a unified alethkar). it is clear she suggested having allies that would unite based on loyalty and not fear. later on, with the help of the glyphs and visions, they tried to make peace with the parshendi by meeting with eshonai. navani was part of the failed mission which sent adolin instead of his father for this task; she was also writing the script for adolin sending it via spanreed to their scribe inadara, who accompanied and translated to him. regardless of the war and internal alethi plotting; navani never stopped her research on fabrials. among other works, she looked to make warcamps more sustainable (trying to build water pumps), creating possible weapons (moving plates) and even working on history (finding the gemstones on shardblades are not part of the original piece). they faced a setback when the publication of the visions were changed from the way she had written them. the tone was changed to imply mockery; though navani was furious with the outcome (his image would be strongly damaged), dalinar took it better saying he would not hide from the truth. shortly after that, upon shallan’s return from the chasm with a very detailed drawing of the shattered plains, they all go in search for the oathgate to urithiru and to make, what they hoped would be, the final strike towards the parshendi. battle of narak[edit] on the way to battle, navani became close to shallan and her work. confirming she would not take the project from her, but would participate and get her scholars to work for her as well. once navani commits to the research, shallan reveals to her that jasnah's soulcaster was a fake; that her daughter could soulcast on her own, without any fabrial, and that she'd seen her do it. this means that her daughter was a knight radiant. a couple of days before the battle itself, she was part of the questioning done to rlain when he came back to bridge four to support their cause. she was the one to transcribe all he had said. during the battle itself, navani fought with fabrials leading her scholars to use them in battle. she helped the alethi to see during the night as one of her fabrials bathed the battlefield in an extraordinarily even white light. next she asked for the ""attractors"" to clear the rain for the arrows. water quickly started to pool around the fabrial. it was pulling moisture from the air. roion’s archers were able to hit the parshendi and make an immediate difference which was enough to save part of his army. at the same time, her scholars led by inadara, were key in helping shallan find, reach and open the oathgate, which eventually gave the alethi an escape.. uniting roshar[edit] once at urithiru, she continued to transcribe the visions in much more detail now that dalinar could replay them at will. after odium manifested on one vision, he decided his next action would be to unite all of roshar and asked navani to help him. he believed that his tenacity and her brilliance together would convince the other kingdoms to join with them. she and dalinar got married, with the stormfather officiating the ceremony, since the stormfather always encourages any types of oaths. while working with dalinar on plans to bring the kingdoms together, she continued to write her memoirs, work on large-scale civic project at urithiru including sewage, and research and develop several types of fabrials, like pain or time-related ones. the unification of roshar did not go as they expected. only taravangian from kharbranth answered back with support. navani was the main political voice talking to each leader. when dalinar found out that he could bring people into his visions, navani, along with jasnah were the first ones to go in. they arrived at the aharietiam, the last desolation. in the beginning navani was mostly wondering of the place, how real it looked and even bullied a radiant to show him his fabrial. later however, when they started to see more about that day, she started asking about the parshmen and later the honorblades. the stormfather finally confided in them the truth about that day and how the heralds decided not to go back and stop the desolations, at least for a time. in future visits, she was decided to find the feverstone keep and what happened at the recreance. navani led also the research of urithiru itself and found the patters on the gemstones, which opened the code for understanding recorded phrases of the last radiants who lived at urithiru. eventually, after playing different strategies like setting leaders/key people into visions, writhing essays, or helping queen fen with the wounded and reconstructions; dalinar and navani were able to get several of the kings in roshar to agree on meeting and fighting together. unfortunately, by the time they arrived, dalinar was fragile with the return of most of his memories and the fall of kholinar. navani had to deal with them with some help from taravangian. on the day of the first meeting of monarchs at urithiru, navani made each person-no matter how important-carry their own chair. the old alethi tradition symbolized each chief bringing important wisdom to a gathering. she was able keep her mind clear enough from her worries of elhokar to analyze the other kings, their companions and the highprinces. ialai sadeas notably ignored the chair request. she welcomed everyone and started with an inspirational speech of making history and uniting for a cause. the meeting however went out of control very fast as each kingdom started making requests on territory, trade, half-shards, and war. navani was able to get them to agree by listening what each kingdom did best and giving them tasks that were in line with that. she complimented the azish´s laws and were given the task to create codes of how kingdoms are to interact and share resources. thaylenah was asked to oversee trade and supplies. the alethi would help the emuli at securing the remaining territory, but not more. then, they moved to guessing where they would be attacked next, they decided it would be jah keved and support from other kingdom came. navani had done it. when dalinar was recovering and well enough to join a meeting, he figured out the target would be thaylenah and not jah keved. this meeting however, was abruptly ended by taravangian’s treason, who leaked several of dalinar’s secrets in a targeted way which caused distrust. they were not able to hold the coalition together. battle of thaylen field and aftermath[edit] though the coalition broke, thaylen accepted the alethi help to aid on the possible invasion from odium and his forces. navani traveled to that city to support the queen. during the battle itself, she and queen fen were attacked by a huge rock monster who destroyed the tower they were in. navani and fen were able to go down the surviving steps. from there navani was able to see that amaram had switched sides and dalinar facing the unmade alone. navani, fen and her consort kmakl were then captured by one of amaram’s troops who still blamed the kholins for the killing of torol sadeas. as they were going to execute kmakl, navani pulled out her painrial and knocked their enemies down. they were later joined by adolin, who gave her the news on elhokar’s death and provided comfort. later jasnah came in to ask her to clear the center of the city and save citizens. they looked after them until dalinar came back and navani went to take care of him. dalinar gave her the gem that imprisoned nergaoul and asked her to study it. he also requested her to teach him how to read. navani not only taught him to read and write, but helped him with his autobiography: oathbringer, my glory and my shame. orchestrating the aimian expedition[edit] after the thaylen military discovered the first dreams, navani published a request for another ship to investigate a region of aimia. navani was paid a visit by rysn, who had indicated an interest in the mission. navani started confused until she had read the notes her assistant handed her. they shortly discussed rysn's inspection of the ghost ship, with rysn assuring navani her disabilities were no hindrance to the mission. there was no trace of the soulcaster, kaza, or her device, on the ship that had been found. the queen indicated that she had heard from the prince of liafor that the ship had likely gone to aimia, to the hidden island of akinah. in reply, rysn said that akinah was only a legend. navani pointed out the same was said of urithiru. the conversation drifted to mythical creatures that fed on stormlight, and resulted in navani inspecting chiri-chiri, who immediately went to eat the stormlight out of the lamp. rysn explained she got her on the reshi-isles. navani steered the conversation to practical matters discussing the ship. she offered rysn a generous compensation for the mission. at rysn's request, navani would arrange an endorsement of the mission from queen fen and ensure the ardent on the mission would experiment with new fabrial technology that could help rysn deal with her disability. navani sent rushu on the expedition with fabrial technology to experiment. it should allow for a seat hover in the air, and test the effects of aluminum. moreover, navani intentionally send windrunners on the mission that did not have access to their shardblades yet, to prevent sending a key to the gate should the enemy hold it. however, she did allow rushu to take a soulcaster to help access underground caverns. evacuation of hearthstone[edit] during the battle between kaladin and the fused at hearthstone, navani was aboard the fourth bridge, an airship that she designed with her team of engineers. while speaking with dalinar about the mysterious crystal pillar at urithiru, dieno enne calah, the mink, snuck onto the fourth bridge. despite the mink's hostility towards dalinar for the war between alethkar and herdaz, dalinar and the mink made a deal to let the mink's remaining forces onto the fourth bridge. as the evacuation commenced, navani collaborated with the crew and engineers to secure the hearthstone refugees. when dalinar opened a perpendicularity to replenish stormlight, navani and rushu made some observations about the nature of shadesmar. the conversation turned to the subject of urthiru. navani, though frustrated about her inability to discover the tower's secrets, told rushu that their discoveries might help improve future airship designs. while rushu was writing down her thoughts, she told navani that she saw a strange man on a hill, standing aside from the battle. navani recognized the man as moash. she alerted the windrunners to moash's presence. on the way back to urithiru, navani reviewed her notes on fabrials. she studied the strange suppression fabrial that kaladin and lift had found while fighting the fused. navani observed that the gemstones in the suppression fabrial were the same as the gemstones in urithiru's central pillar. confused by this revelation, she compared the pillar and the fabrial to the layout of a soulcaster. the dilemma of the soulcasters grabbed her attention, since they didn't adhere to any laws or mechanics of fabrial science. although she wanted to look deeper into the mysteries of these devices, she found no concrete answers in her research. as the windrunners and the fourth bridge neared the shattered plains, navani glimpsed a conjoined ruby inside her flying chamber. she attached it to a spanreed. the person on the other end of the spanreed accused navani of being a monster who imprisoned spren. the spanreed then ceased writing, despite navani's attempts to re-establish contact. return to urithiru[edit] upon returning to urithiru, navani interrogated an imprisoned szeth about the strange dark sphere that he'd possessed. she noted that the sphere had similar visual properties to ones infused with voidlight, but was not the same. szeth recounted the night of gavilar's assassination to her. however, he had no answers as to what the sphere was. all he knew was that gavilar had given him the sphere right before he died. when he asked navani if she hated him, navani told him that she did. later on, she paid a visit to the cloudwalk. she met with gavinor and his nursemaid on the cloudwalk. navani embraced her grandson and listened to him talk excitedly about his recent adventures. though she was concerned about how his trauma in kholinar was affecting his development, she said nothing. gavinor asked her why dalinar wasn't teaching him the sword, since he wanted to take revenge on the man that killed his father. navani deflected the question, promising to discuss it further with dalinar. she went over some strange barometric and temperature readings with her research team. strangely enough, the temperature and pressure rose in front of a storm. navani theorized that urthiru's elevation could be affecting the readings, then advised them to dedicate further observation to the matter. she also gave gavilar's strange sphere to the engineers talnah and nem for further study. afterwards, she met with her family and the mink to discuss further action against odium's forces. for most of the discussion, navani remained a silent observer, watching jasnah and dalinar discuss strategy with the mink. though she was surprised when the mink proposed that the coalition retake emul, she and jasnah eventually persuaded dalinar to agree with the plan. further studies[edit] ""“as always, questions teased her. questions were disorder awaiting organization. the more you understood, the more the world aligned. the more the chaos made sense, as all things should. ”-navani"" navani resumed her studies on the crystal pillar beneath urithiru, but reached another dead end in her research. attempting to focus her attention elsewhere, she paid a visit to falilar and tomor, who presented her with a lifting fabrial that enabled the redirection of force. navani wore the device and participated in some experiments that tested its practical applications. falilar showed her a shaft in urithiru that was rigged with pulleys and weights, which would provide the manpower for the device. inspired, navani encouraged him to refine the design and experiment with the pulley system. at a meeting of the coalition of monarchs, navani encountered taravangian. she coldly criticized his takeover of jah keved. taravangian asserted that both gavilar and dalinar had committed worse crimes. when the meeting began, she expected taravangian to oppose the proposal for an emuli offensive. however, taravangian agreed, much to everyone's surprise. the coalition made significant progress in organizing their forces to prepare for emul, as well as designating people to lead an envoy to the honorspren. despite this, navani felt uneasy at taravangian's swift agreement to the proposal. later, in private, she eventually voiced her concerns to dalinar about taravangian. dalinar told her that he had similar worries, likening taravangian's betrayal to sadeas's treachery on the shattered plains. he insisted that navani stay at urithiru in case something went awry in emul. navani promised that she would. trials of the tower[edit] during the departure of the coalition's forces, navani bade dalinar goodbye as she warned him about taravangian's potential schemes. thought it troubled her that dalinar wanted to take gavinor to the front lines in emul, she permitted him to do so, since dalinar argued that he wanted to be more involved with their grandson. she asked jasnah to watch over dalinar on the battlefield and keep him out of the fighting. with the help of sebarial and anesa, she began coordinating the day-to-day running of urithiru in dalinar's absence. she checked on a team of radiants and engineers, who were studying a crack in the wall that her scribes found. falilar told her that the crack concealed a hidden room, which contained a scale model of urithiru. as navani was leaving the room, her scribe isabi brought her a blinking spanreed. navani immediately dropped her current task to answer the mysterious person's request. navani's scribes set up her spanreed. the engineers rigged a system that would allow them to determine the location of the person on the spanreed's opposite end. after a terse back-and-forth conversation over spanreed, navani ordered her team to move her and the spanreed to a different place. she contacted the person again, and she and kalami deduced that the person must be a spren. falilar noted that he could tell the spren was writing from inside the tower. spontaneously, navani decided to break her spanreed to see if she could lure out the spren in the future. despite her destruction of the spanreed, navani's team was no closer to pinpointing the spren. she remained preoccupied while running urithiru and working with her scholars. tomor showed her his new design for the lifting fabrial, which navani wore and tested. she suggested that tomor refine the controls to enable more precise descent and ascent. following her conversation with tomor, her guards brought dabbid forwards, since they found him hiding a spanreed ruby at her workstation. navani tried to interrogate him, but to no avail. though navani didn't recognize dabbid, her soldiers told her that he was a servant for the windrunners. as they took dabbid to navani's audience chamber, navani noticed that isabi was receiving a spanreed message. the message relayed news of an explosion, which had killed talnah and nem and destroyed scholarly equipment. when she arrived at the scene, navani surveyed the damage, then ordered rushu to secure the area. she returned to her audience chamber to interrogate a number of radiants stationed at urithiru. red, one of the lightweavers, told her about dabbid and his disability. navani ordered her scribes to set up a spanreed with the ruby that dabbid had delivered. the spanreed began to write frantically about the singers that had infiltrated urithiru. it stated that it was the sibling, the spren of the tower. the singer invasion[edit] as red and the other radiants began to collapse, navani tried to reestablish contact with the sibling. she asked her soldiers to run messages to the nearby garrisons, since the spanreeds stopped functioning. while ordering her scribes to move to the map room, she learned from dabbid that the sibling spoke to him through veins of crystal in the tower walls. in the map room, navani found kholin forces gathered around a map of the tower. the officers reported that every radiant in the tower was unconscious, with singers invading from the lowest and highest levels of the tower. navani told them that their best hope was fighting their way to the pillar room in the basement. on her orders, battalionlord teofil mobilized his soldiers and sent them to the lower floors. as he began relaying navani's commands to the soldiers, navani found a vein of crystal in the wall. she spoke directly to the sibling, who reported that raboniel had corrupted the tower's defenses. though the sibling expressed their distaste for navani and her experiments, they told her how to activate a final line of defense against the singers. navani's contingent made their way down to the pillar room, using a fake rout and an ambush to lure away the fused. accompanied by her attendants, she made her way to the bottom floors of urithiru. dabbid helped her find a vein of crystal that the sibling could send messages through. the sibling ordered navani to infuse the topaz connected to the crystal vein. with the help of two thaylen scholars, vrandl and ulvlk, she used a tuning fork and strategic vibrations to siphon stormlight into the uninfused topaz. the infused topaz opened a hidden chamber with another large gemstone. with her team's help, navani began siphoning stormlight into the second gemstone. she communicated with the sibling, who reported that teofil and his men had fallen to the fused. the fully infused gemstone activated a shield around the gemstone pillar that formed the sibling's heart. navani then surrendered to the singers and negotiated the terms with raboniel. though raboniel offered to hire her as a research assistant, navani said she would deliberate it with her scholars first. occupation of urithiru[edit] on the first day of the occupation, navani told raboniel that she and her scholars would accept their offer. pleased, raboniel asked navani to sketch the schematics of fourth bridge's flying platform. while sketching, navani realized with help from raboniel that soulcasters, the tower's elevators, and other abnormal fabrials were comprised directly of spren, instead of powered by spren trapped in gemstones. under the watchful eye of singer guards, navani directed her scholars to occupy themselves with busy work and revisions as a stalling tactic. when raboniel cut her off from direct contact with her scholars, she instructed them to continue researching voidlight fabrials and sent them nonsense ciphered messages to occupy raboniel's spies. she continued to communicate with the sibling, using the sibling's awareness of the tower to get information on raboniel and deciding that her most important goal was to protect the sibling. they were distrustful of her, both because of her use of fabrials and her human ability to twist words convincingly, but helped her contact kaladin, updating him on their situation. however, this method of communication was turned against her when she convinced the sibling to give her the location of the node in the well, only to discover that raboniel had been listening in on their conversations. kaladin managed to destroy the node, but the sibling felt betrayed and refused to talk to navani for a while. raboniel brought her food and wine, and they had a conversation about the history of the conflict between humans and singers and raboniel's desire to end the war at any cost. when navani mentioned no longer wishing to do research under raboniel, raboniel appealed to her curiosity and convinced her to continue. they began collaborating, and navani came to a realization about how using honor's, odium's, and cultivation's rhythms could affect the light. raboniel taught her honor's rhythm, and with raboniel singing odium's rhythm at the same time as navani sang honor's, they were able to create warlight, the combination of stormlight and voidlight, for the first time, as well as a rhythm that raboniel titled the rhythm of war. navani then realized raboniel's true desire for the experiments - to find anti-light - and knew that gavilar's strange sphere was an example of this anti-light, although she did not reveal that. as a thank you for the breakthrough of the production of warlight rabionel had two singer musicians play the tones of honor and odium on plates temporarily affixed to navani's desk she also granted navani the title ""voice of lights"". afterward, rabionel seemingly ended their collaboration stating that she needed to focus on finishing the corruption of the sibling. rabionel also gave navani free reign to continue experiments on her own and provided any resource requested. with rabionel distancing herself to focus on defeating the sibling's shield navani toils for days on the concept of anti-voidlight. utilizing the same plates that rabionel rewarded her for she begins to conceptualize sound waves and the patterns that the distinct lights create. further delving into music theory she theorizes that the anti-voidlight rhythm would sound identical to the ear as the regular voidlight rhythm. eventually she is successful at creating a plate that produces the correct rhythm. rabionel returns and upon realizing what navani is working on forces her to reveal her research. the two are then successful at creating an anti-voidlight gem utilizing a vacuum tube to isolate the light from the rhythms of roshar. rabionel, understanding the implications of the breakthrough betrays navani once again and begins to manufacture anti-stormlight with the intention of killing the incapacitated radiants along with their spren. a day later she is visited by moash, who has every intention of killing her but is redirected by raboniel who sends him to deal with kaladin first. navani, left to her own devices once again, finds the dagger raboniel used to kill her daughter with, some anti-voidlight still left in its gem. she plans and prepares fabrial traps, and is able to get the jump on raboniel, gravely injuring her with the anti-voidlight dagger, but fails to kill her on the spot. this failure proves fortuitous because when moash comes back for navani, raboniel is able to hold him off just long enough for navani to negotiate a bond with the sibling. a freshly bonded bondsmith, navani drives moash away, restores and tower, and sends the invaders running for their lives. relationships[edit] gavilar[edit] ""“my husband was an excellent king -- an inspiring leader, an unparalleled duelist, and a genius of battlefield tactics. but he didn't have a single scholarly finger on his left hand. he never showed an interest in the accounting of highstorms, was bored by talk of science, and ignored fabrials unless they had an obvious use in battle. he was a man built after the classical masculine ideal. ”-extract from navani on her book."" during the unification of alethkar, navani was a good partner to gavilar, helping him with the strategy and creating/executing plots that would help their cause. though navani had been interested in fabrials her entire life, gavilar shared with his brother a lack of interest in the mechanics, only caring about the function. at first, navani and gavilar were close, but they grew apart as time went by, with gavilar doing things such as inviting renowned artifabrians to feasts and not speaking a word of it to navani. this culminated in an argument between them on the night of his death after which navani burnt a glyphward praying for his death, one of the finest she had ever created. when she heard of the news of his death, she first thought that he had disappeared somewhere with nale and kalak, only believing that he was dead after seeing his corpse for herself. although she worried that her lack of grief would gain her a reputation for callousness, it instead provided a solid foundation for the grieving royal staff. though she threatened to tell the entire world the truth about him in her biography of him, she instead told the story that was expected, as the truth would fracture the country. dalinar[edit] navani and dalinar were friends before he introduced her to gavilar. at that point it seems they were both interested in her. navani chose gavilar over dalinar because she found dalinar to be frightening. when navani returns to the shattered plains from kholinar, she frequently speaks with dalinar, and later becomes romantically involved with him, which is unusual, because in the eyes of alethi society, she is now considered to be dalinar's sister. part of what navani finds intriguing about him is that he's begun to be the person the others all claim to be. she now finds dalinar's intensity, which frightened her when they both were younger, to be fascinating because he's now wrapped it in emotional armor. navani believes dalinar to be a kind man, and a bit overprotective. she never mocks dalinar, never acts skeptical of that which he reveals in his visions. when she learns of his ""death"" at the battle of the tower, upon receipt of the news of sadeas's betrayal, navani worried about dalinar, as he had no daughters and no wife, meaning he had no one to pray for him. so, navani endeavors to paint a prayer in glyph format upon the stones of the plains. she creates a wish out of despair, a plea out of anguish: thath: justice. after he came back, he decided not to keep the relationship a secret, and they became a couple; not only personally but as leaders of the war and kingdom. she had a way with him, translating scholarship into battle tactics, that helped them understand each other. she also made sure he did not hate the other alethi princes, but to see them as his people. their wedding ceremony was carried out by the stormfather. he believes he loves her the most for being open and genuine in a society that prided itself on secrets. she’d been breaking taboos, and hearts, since their youth. dalinar confided in navani all he remembered of her visit to the nightwatcher, she was very supportive. when he started to get his memories back she researched the old magic to try to understand why it was happening; but in more than three hundred cases all effects lasted till death. after the battle of thaylen, he requests navani to teach him how to read and write. she does and also helps him with the writing of his autobiography. jasnah[edit] jasnah believes her mother has a tendency toward the overwhelming. she does not let her mother 'mother' her. navani knows it. she would try to get close to her daughter, and there was a coldness, like even being near her mother reminded jasnah that she had once been a child. she wonders what happened to her little girl, so full of questions. navani knows jasnah better that anyone else, but wishes she had some sense to go with her intelligence. she believes that jasnah never did have the decency to be wrong an appropriate amount of the time. when she thought jasnah was dead, navani considers it to be her first time mourning, implying there difficulties between her and gavilar before his assassination. her journals tell of just how deeply navani felt the loss of her daughter. that also affected navani's relationship with shallan, who she first sent away. once jasnah returned to urithiru, they start working closely both in research and politics. jasnah would lecture her mother sometimes, but she is still respectful enough to apologize to navani afterwards. elhokar[edit] navani loves her son, but doesn't consider him a capable king; she calls him her ""poor distracted, oblivious boy"". she acknowledges that he is seen as weak, and intends to see him protected despite himself, if necessary. in spite of elhokar's feeling towards dalinar, he gives them his blessing for the wedding and a sincere hug as he knows it will make his mother happy shallan[edit] before meeting shallan, through jasnah, navani had offered to look into shallan's soulcaster to try fix it. she was also very supportive on her engagement towards adolin. to shallan, navani looks like a version of jasnah twenty years older; still pretty, though with a motherly air. after learning of her daughter's death from shallan, navani refuses to see her, or have anything to do with her. she even accused her of dooming her when she burned the ship with her ""unconscious"". ""“ shallan was apparently no longer an outsider, but one of navani’s clutch - and chana help the man or woman who stood between navani and one of her own. ”-dalinar after shallan emerged from the chasms"" their relationship changed dramatically after she survived the fall to the chasms. upon her return, navani became motherly and protective of her. she became one of her own. navani admits to shallan that she's been ignoring things, things that she should not, because they bring her pain. shallan apologizes to her, but navani insists that shallan has nothing to apologize for. navani finds shallan's organization of her notes on jasnah's findings interesting. navani acknowledges to shallan that she thinks like an artist, that she can see it in the way shallan put her notes together. adolin[edit] navani and adolin are very close. he is very polite with asking questions on her fabrials, though he is bored by the scholarship, he usually enjoys the military use he can use for them. she burned prayers for him when dueling and made fun of his superstitious rituals before the duel. she also persuaded adolin to at least consider an engagement with shallan. though she was cold to shallan after shallan brought news of jasnah's death, navani never stopped supporting the relationship between adolin and shallan. at first, adolin was not very happy with the relationship between his father and navani, mostly because it would place his father in an inconvenient position when it came to enforcing the codes. he later becomes supportive of the wedding, shown by his whooping and the joyspren he trailed as he ran. at the battle of thaylen field, adolin seeks navani to protect her and give her the news on elhokar's death. he provided her comfort. raboniel[edit] navani agrees, when pressured, to work under raboniel and research the different types of light. she calls raboniel ancient one as directed when they first meet, and although she does not trust her, shares her findings in the name of scientific discovery. she is interested in the scientific and historical insights raboniel has to offer, but understands that they are enemies. however, this distinction becomes more difficult for her to remember as their relationship progresses and they spend more time together. navani gains a deeper understanding of raboniel's motivations and emotions, especially when she sees raboniel grieve over essu, and even begins to recognize her rhythms. raboniel respects navani and her scientific mind, saying she is in debt to navani and giving her the title voice of lights as a sign of respect. she often compliments navani on her intelligence and scientific discoveries, but navani is uncomfortable with this praise as she does not believe herself deserving of it. navani attempts to kill raboniel, but it is a very difficult decision for her. when she ends up killing raboniel out of mercy, she comforts her by humming the rhythm of war one final time and holding her hand. navani genuinely mourns raboniel after her death. quotes[edit] ""“you two are a pair of nails in the same doorframe. stern, hard, and storming annoying to pull free. ”-navani to dalinar on him and jasnah"" ""“you loathe their excess, and you are close to applying that emotion to them as well. they live the lives they have known, the lives that society has taught them are proper. you won’t change them with contempt. you aren’t wit; it isn’t your job to scorn them. your job is to enfold them, encourage them. lead them, dalinar. ”-navani to dalinar on the highprinces of alethkar"" ""“journey before destination, you bastard! ”-navani to moash"" trivia[edit] - navani is an orthodox theist. - she’s a traditionalist, who wants the old religion to really work, who is trying to reconcile this with newer discoveries. - she is a few months older than dalinar. - navani would make a better amyrlin than jasnah for most of the history of tar valon. see also[edit] notes[edit]"
Rushu,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rushu,"""“navani, have you ever wondered why the almighty gave beards to men, but not women? for that matter, why do we consider it feminine for a woman to have long hair? should not more hair be a masculine trait? many of them have quite a lot of it, you see. ”-rushu to navani kholin"" rushu is an ardent that works as scholar affiliated with the kholin princedom. rushu is interested in the study of handwriting and fabrials, and does research that revolutionizes artifabrians' understanding of how shardblades function. appearance and personality[edit] rushu is a very attractive young woman. like many ardents, she keeps her head shaved. her face has delicate features, with long lush eyelashes and button-like lips. rushu is a brilliant scholar, but occasionally somewhat oblivious to her surroundings. she does not notice hints or implied commands in others' words, it often requires a direct command and multiple promptings to get her attention and make her realize what she is supposed to do. rushu often gets distracted as well, reading scientific reports when she should be helping with an experiment. she has trouble focusing, often wandering off on tangents and random thought experiments in conversation, or getting very excited. she joined the ardentia to escape the advances of men, but this did not work particularly well, as she still receives attention from many of the male ardents. she is particularly interested in spren research and the study of handwriting, among other things. rushu is also a courageous person that is willing to risk her safety for her studies, as evidenced by her desire to ride on the fabrial parapet as it ascended. attributes and abilities[edit] rushu is a skilled artifabrian, who devised a hovering seat for rysn ftori. she is also trained in the use of a soulcaster, and has one during the expedition to aimia. history[edit] early life[edit] much about rushu's early life is unknown, but she joined the ardentia at some point in her past to escape the advances of men, due to her extremely attractive appearance. she became one of the kholin scholars and worked often with brightlady navani kholin, who became fond of her and developed a high regard for rushu's intelligence. research on the shattered plains[edit] rushu was summoned after the glyphs counting down to the arrival of the everstorm were discovered for the first time. rushu observed that the glyphs were poorly drawn, asymmetrical and uneven, as well as vague in their meaning. she was charged by navani to make a copy of those glyphs and not to speak of them to anyone, then was sent away so that navani could speak with highprince dalinar kholin privately. rushu was also present at navani's test of the floating parapet made with the use of reverser fabrials. she was initially distracted, reading about geranid's experiments with flamespren, but soon focused on the project at hand. rushu was excited that the parapet seemed to be working, but wished that she could have been on the platform itself to check the gemstones for cracks. navani sent rushu to inspect the gems with the other ardents, so that she could speak to her nephew brightlord adolin kholin privately. rushu also later questioned why shardblades could be summoned or dismissed even if the gemstone on their hilt had gone dun. she spent several weeks in contact with the ardents in kharbranth via one of the tashikki relay stations to do some research in the palanaeum on the subject. they reported to rushu that they had found accounts that the blades initially were not able to be summoned or dismissed until ornamental gemstones were added to their hilts. they also found stories of the hilts actually changing shape to accept the gemstones. this knowledge that rushu provided was a breakthrough for artifabrians, helping them to realize that the only function of the gemstone was to aid in bonding the blade; therefore, it was not part of a fabrial that made the sword supernaturally light and sharp. service in urithiru[edit] shortly after arriving in urithiru, rushu assisted adolin kholin in directing workers to unload their wagons at the right place in the massive city according to navani's layout. when dalinar and navani considered getting married, navani asked several ardents, including rushu, to marry them. however, like all of the other ardents, rushu turned them down, as vorinism considered them siblings by way of navani's marriage to gavilar kholin; she even squeaked and literally ran away. later, rushu joined king elhokar kholin, dalinar, and navani on a trip to the alethi warcamps on the shattered plains. they traveled to the shattered plains via the oathgate, and then were flown to the warcamps by kaladin and his windrunners, which rushu found exhilarating. once they arrived, she discussed sketches for a flying ship with navani and commented that the math wasn't right, though she had trouble focusing, as she was still excited about the experience of flying. expedition to aimia[edit] navani selected rushu to join rysn's expedition to akinah. she got secret details on the mission and briefed lopen, huio, and cord when they joined. a few weeks into the voyage, rushu started experimenting with her fabrials. in the meantime, she reprimanded lopen for making inappropriate jokes near rysn. using a pair of silvery hoops with ruby, she explained conjoining fabrials that move in opposite directions to rysn. they discussed why spanreeds didn't work on a ship while those other fabrials did, an answer that was based on perception. rushu proposed to rysn that she could make rysn's seat hover in the air, although she would not be able to move it. when putting the fabrials away, rysn spotted sheets of aluminum. the ardent explained those could block spanreeds and that navani wanted her to experiment with them. when huio flew to some nearby land to send and receive messages, rushu gave him some aluminum plates to use in experiments when writing to her on the ship. later, the expedition camped a night in a small cove. rushu went to rysn to experiment with her chair, without waiting for rysn's permission. she explained that when huio was playing with her spanreeds he had made an important discovery: if aluminum was placed in the spanreed in the right way, only movement along one plane of motion was transferred to the other reed. she demonstrated the effect by making rysn's chair hover, then pushing the chair around, something thought to be impossible before. at nikli's suggestion, rysn asked rushu to report the discovery back to urithiru immediately. later, rushu and huio installed a mechanism on rysn's seat that allowed her to hover and rotate her seat. when the expedition reached aimia, rushu joined huio and lopen in a boat going to shore. they arrived on a beach full of gemstones. when one of sailors asked if the treasure was cursed, rushu answered that they were there to loot the place. rushu made some sketches of the skeletons on the beach before joining lopen and several guards to move inwards on the island. ""“we're here to loot the place, armsman kstled.... get on with it. i want to sleep in a bed of boundless lucre tonight.”-rushu to the sailors on the beaches of akinah"" when they reached the outskirts of the city, rushu sketched some of the buildings while lopen flew into the air to look ahead. they moved on and surveyed the city, noting how much it had fallen to rubble. rushu noted how important this place would be for historians to help understand the past. lopen asked where to find the oathgate, and she replied that most were situated to provide easy access for the ruling class. one of the sailors brought a note from rysn, warning them that something felt off, as it all looked too perfect. she asked lopen for one of the gemstones from the beach and inspected it with a jeweler's loupe. it was fake. they wondered why someone would set up such an elaborate deception. after a short time they reached the location of the oathgate, which was very decayed and without a place to put a shardblade. they concluded that it was fake as well. the ardent asked the sailors to look for stairs or a trapdoor that could lead down. they quickly found it, and rushu used a soulcaster given to her by navani to remove the wall blocking the entrance to the cavern. she remarked that it would have taken an extraordinary effort to hide the oathgate down in the cavern. rushu was proud they managed to crack the secret, but lopen was worried about the response from whoever was watching the place. lopen left for the beach and told rushu to gather the sailors and not to get killed. after the battle against the sleepless hordelings, they made a few more rounds through the city to sketch it. lopen was talking to some rocks, and the ardent asked him if he could be less weird. they moved to the rowboats to get back to the wandersail, and lopen praised rysn's negotiation skills, saying he couldn't believe they survived. rushu concurred that there had been something strange about the situation. notes[edit]"
Yelig-nar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Yelig-Nar,"""“yelig-nar, called blightwind, was one that could speak like a man, though often his voice was accompanied by the wails of those he consumed. ”-traxil, line 33, from jasnah's notebook"" yelig-nar, also known as blightwind, is one of the unmade, an ancient and terrible spren of odium. unlike many of the unmade, yelig-nar does not appear to have a physical form, seemingly reliant on a bonding with a human or singer, granting his host a variety of abilities. most recently, yelig-nar joined with meridas amaram to fight in the battle of thaylen field. exactly what level of intelligence yelig-nar himself has is uncertain, as the people he bonds with appear to remain fully in control of themselves. appearance and abilities[edit] ""“yelig-nar had great powers, perhaps the powers of all surges compounded in one. he could transform any voidbringer into an extremely dangerous enemy. curiously, three legends i found mention swallowing a gemstone to engage this process. ”-from hessi’s mythica, page 27"" instead of having a specific physical appearance, yelig-nar is capable of joining with people or singers who swallow a gemstone. this gemstone seems to serve as a housing for yelig-nar, although it is uncertain why the singers must swallow one, as they already have a gemheart. it appears that the people who bond with yelig-nar maintain their personality and memories, at least initially, but they must control him if they do not wish to be consumed by him. in shadesmar, yelig-nar takes the form of a swirling figure of black smoke the size of a normal person. when a person has swallowed a gemstone and bonds yelig-nar, a dark smoke swirls around them. their eyes darken to a red color that occasionally shifts between specific shades such as crimson or a dark blood red. they gradually grow carapace and amethyst crystals that glow with a deep violet light from all over their bodies, including their limbs and head. eventually even the organs within the person's chest cavity will be replaced with an enormous amethyst overgrown with dark veins. the central amethyst in the torso is a weak spot for yelig-nar; when it is damaged its glow will flicker. once the amethyst sustains sufficient damage, it will explode. when the person yelig-nar has bonded is killed, a dark smoke escapes from the corpse. a bond with yelig-nar grants a person the ability to make use of all ten surges, although it is unclear if he can grant adhesion, as it is unusable by fused. it is uncertain where the power source for these surges comes from, but it is possible that yelig-nar makes use of voidlight. it also seems possible that yelig-nar grants preternatural skills in combat, as amaram fights seemingly impossibly gracefully with two shardblades. according to mythology, yelig-nar supposedly consumes souls, but it is not known for certain what this means. it is likely that it simply refers to the people he bonds with, since he feeds on their identity and connection, but it is uncertain if the damage is permanent. yelig-nar consumes its victims entirely, like nightblood, meaning they would not appear in shadesmar before traveling to the beyond upon dying. history[edit] yelig-nar's origin is unknown. it is uncertain when he came into being. yelig-nar was involved in the past desolations; he once broke into nohadon's chancery and killed all of nohadon's scribes. following aharietiam, yelig-nar seems to have remained on roshar, although any actions he may have taken are unknown. yelig-nar was mentioned in a work of writing by traxil that was often cited, but some, including jasnah kholin, doubted its authenticity. ""“if you wish for the promised power, ingest that-then try to control the one who follows. but be warned, the queen at kholinar tried this, and the power consumed her.”-odium to amaram"" following the arrival of the everstorm and the beginning of the true desolation, yelig-nar became active again. alethi queen aesudan kholin, inspired by her father-in-law gavilar, began an investigation into the unmade. she successfully managed to bond yelig-nar, beginning her transformation during the siege of kholinar during kholinar wall guard's attack on the palace. she and her queen's guard followed kaladin and elhokar down into the eastern gallery of the palace, but she did not pursue them after elhokar's death. however, aesudan was not strong enough to control yelig-nar and sometime afterward the power consumed her. during the battle of thaylen field, highlord meridas amaram swallowed an amethyst and bonded with yelig-nar in fulfillment of the promised power odium had offered him. he and some of the fused fought kaladin as amaram transformed, growing amethyst crystals from his body. kaladin successfully managed to crack the gemstone that had replaced amaram's heart, heavily injuring him and knocking him out of the battle for a time. later, when nergaoul was captured, amaram confronted a heavily wounded kaladin who had exhausted his stormlight. amaram nearly killed kaladin with a shardblade. however, rock arrived in time to shoot amaram in the head and chest with arrows from a grandbow, shattering amaram's central amethyst, killing amaram and separating yelig-nar from his host. notes[edit]"

Hion,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Hion,"hion is a form of investiture supplied by the hijo on komashi, used to power technology on that world. it typically takes the form of a pair of energy bands, colored light blue and magenta, called hion lines. appearance and mechanics[edit] hion lines can be found in a variety of sizes, ranging from wire-thin to at least the thickness of a wrist. they originate from the ground, where they are called ""hion stubs"", but from there hion lines extend into the air, branching out, and hang unsupported. their coloring can be described in many ways, but in general they are said to be electric, energetic shades of cyan and magenta. they hum very quietly, and are motionless. touching a hion line gives an overwhelming, electrifying sensation. hion lines are responsible for pushing back the shroud on komashi, and consequently are pervasive in cities when the shroud was present. primary lines a few inches across run down all major streets, floating about twenty feet above the ground, with thin branches winding down smaller streets and in poorer sections of town. the lines themselves can be cultivated and extended, allowing for--among other things--cities to expand into the shroud or passageways between cities to be formed. they are sometimes manipulated for more mundane reasons, such as using the lines themselves to create signage for streets and businesses, or for more practical needs, such as bringing a power source into homes or supporting plant growth on farms. hion is powered by the spirits, or hijo, on komashi. for much of komashi's history, this is directed by the father machine, though hijo are capable of supplying hion directly and of their own will. technology[edit] in nagadan, hion lines are regularly used to support their technology. the simplest use is to create electrical power by connecting two hion lines together: a piece of metal placed between two lines will heat up, acting as a resistor. this is commonly used for heating, and can easily be exploited for lighting as well, among other possible applications. telephones can also utilize hion lines to send signals, though these can be very expensive. hion viewers are a form of television that manipulates hion lines to produce images. the lines themselves are placed behind a glass surface to prevent unwanted contact, and a knob is used to control the device. these are made up of single continuous lines, one of each color of hion, which bend and twist in order to recreate images. these lines are thin enough that they are able to reproduce details as fine as eyelashes. one very common application of hion is in various means of transportation. trains, buses, trolleys, and boats all make use of hion lines. in addition to everyday transportation methods, hion lines can also be used to power spaceships. the space bus engineered by nagadan utilizes a mobile hion line which can be extended rapidly in the direction of desired travel. from komashi, this ship is capable of reaching at least as far as utol and the iron seven waystation. the characters of seasons of regret reference a hion blade, though this device may be fictitious. history[edit] scholars from the institute of mechanical solutions first discovered the concept of hion and built a machine that could utilize the hijo to provide power to torio. despite the catastrophic, unforeseen consequences that followed the machine's activation, the device did fulfill its original purpose of providing hion. it generated hion stubs, emerging from the ground around the kingdom of torio. these began as bright lights emerging from the ground, and were the only places plants could grow within the shroud. humans settled at these locations and learned to cultivate the hion lines, extending them and branching them out. due to the way hion was able to repel the shroud, these hion lines ultimately became the foundational aspect of infrastructure on komashi, and in the seventeen centuries that followed they developed hion technology extensively. hijo continued to supply the hion lines after the machine was destroyed, albeit willingly and in exchange for hion viewer dramas. trivia[edit] - the hion colors were intentionally picked as two of the colors commonly used in printers. it is as of yet unknown what happened to the color yellow. - the two colors are a manifestation of the general push-pull theme that can be seen with all investiture. it is, however, much more pronounced with virtuosity. notes[edit]"

perceptive, and good at reading others. she is highly confident and unafraid to speak her mind, nor is she opposed to skirting or breaking the rules. this confidence, along with her refined and poised manner, makes fm appear older than the rest of her flight. she can be a perfectionist and dislikes her own shortcomings, even when she is doing better than her classmates. fm is more conservative when presented with risky choices, choosing to take the safer option. she may do this as a statement against the strong risk taking attitude promoted by the ddf. she's is a people person who is often the instigator of group trips off the base, and also enjoys reading. disputer[edit] fm self-identifies as a disputer, a member of a movement that believes the defiant culture is becoming too jingoistic and authoritarian and that the dictatorship ruling detritus has too much power. she's highly critical of military culture and worship of the first citizens, and is quick to notice and challenge any hypocrisy from her peers. however, for all her misgivings she is supportive of the continued war against the krell and works hard to become a pilot, despite feeling guilty for conforming to ddf militaristic society. she likes being asked about her beliefs, and will often complain that her flight members are too aggressive. attributes and abilities[edit] ""“i figure these clowns will all get

rank of pilot. she is best suited to smaller ships. during flight school fm trains to pilot a poco, perform aerial maneuvers, and use its weaponry. it is unknown as to whether she was required to sit the entrance exam or whether she is the descendant of a first citizen and was granted free admission. she may have had flight experience prior to joining the ddf, however lacked some of the background tactical knowledge known by her classmates. fm is an excellent pilot who is highly skilled with a light-lance and at maneuvers. she is good enough with destructors to be able to take down enemy units by brute force, although this weapon is not her strong suit. she has a tendency to be overly cautious, though this habit has lead her to greatly improve her precision in the cockpit. she is well suited as a scout, and for a time join their ranks after graduation, though was initially resistant to the idea. prior to graduation, fm was also offered a place in nightmare flight. when skyward flight was reformed, she joined in a specialized capacity, likely flying an interceptor. she comes from a highly-merited family, giving her a large degree of freedom, wealth, and influence. history[edit] flight school[edit] fm comes from one of the lower caves and a highly-merited family. after being accepted into flight school, fm was placed in skyward flight under the tutelage of cobb. she was roomed with the other female members of her flight, with the exception of spensa, who was denied accommodation. unlike many of the other members of skyward flight, fm successfully launched her poco during the first lesson run by cobb. when the lesson was interrupted by a krell attack, fm, along with the rest of skyward flight, were ordered to take to the sky and line up close to the battle to deceive the krell into thinking there were more pilots ready to join the conflict. when the krell began to chase jorgen, fm expressed her surprise that they wouldn't attack the weakest members of the team first. ""“i was raised defiant. but i choose, now, to be what people down below call a disputer-i raise objections about the way the war is being run. i think we should throw off the oppressive mantle of military government.”-fm explaining the disputers movement to spensa"" fm played it safe during the ring game when skyward flight practiced their light-lancing. she stuck to the easiest rings in the first two rounds and avoided the rings entirely on the final round, regardless of their difficulty. a few days later, skyward flight was once again sent into battle against the krell, this time fighting alongside full pilots. fm survived the battle, however, lost two of her other flightmates: bim and morningtide. fm approached spensa the day after the battle to thank her for what she had said about bim and morningtide's death. as the two left the classroom for the day, fm introduced spensa to the disputer movement and explained how and why they opposed the defiant leadership. when the shipyard began falling, the first time skyward flight had flown since morningtide and bim's deaths, fm, arturo, hurl, and jorgen, ended up cut off from the other members of the flight after they were attacked by krell. eventually the members of the flight were able to regroup and joined riptide flight as they returned back to base. the next week, fm, along with kimmalyn and hurl, devised a plan to sneak spensa into their dormitory for the evening. following the day's lesson, fm and kimmalyn retired to their bunks before dinner, claiming to be unwell. kimmalyn lead spensa to their room, meeting up with fm near the door and smuggled spensa inside where she found blankets piled as a makeshift bed and food waiting for her. as the girls waited for hurl to return, fm rambled about the militaristic defiant culture, it's negative effects on their society, as well as the ddf's treatment of spensa. she explained her motivations for why she had agreed to go to flight school when signed up by her parents and how she hoped it would give her a platform she could use to push for change. after a later training session, skyward flight was called to action to help defend against a krell attack. the flight took up position near one of alta's aa guns away from the main fight to wait as backup. after the flight was given the green light to engage, fm tried to fall in behind kimmalyn to try provide assistance when she was swarmed by krell. despite her best efforts, the krell kept locking onto kimmalyn even after they were driven away, leading to fm picking up a tail of her own, however, before long it disengaged to instead target spensa. after the death of hurl, fm, along with the other remaining members of skyward flight, were given a weeks leave in order to recover. during their week of leave, fm attempted to find spensa, even asking cobb if he knew the location of her cave, likely in an attempt to get the other girl to hangout with the members of skyward flight. after meeting up with nedd, arturo, and kimmalyn, fm returned to the barrack's at kimmalyn's request to retrieve a necklace the other girl had accidentally left behind when she quit the ddf. on her way, fm ran into spensa and convinced the other girl to come with her to the restaurant where their flightmates had decided to meet. once the pair had arrived, fm left spensa with the group while she went to order the other girl food and a drink, knowing that spensa had eaten not much more than rat for the last few months. although the meal was paid for by arturo, fm studiously continued to bring spensa food, in order to treat her friend who had not been able to access real meals since before flight school began. after returning the necklace she retrieved to kimmalyn, fm and her friends spoke of hurl, remembering their friend and reminiscing about their time in flight school. when arturo's girlfriend, bryn, went to the bathroom, the members of skyward flight talked briefly about the strangeness of krell tactics and the ddf's hesitancy to talk about these things. before the end of their temporary break, fm and arturo went to see a league game when they were given tickets by nedd. shortly after the end of skyward flight's medical leave, fm gained spensa as a roommate, as the other woman had been given permission to live and take meals at alta base. several days later, fm and spensa joined the other two cadet flights, inkwell and firestorm, in the dining hall and discussed the possibility of the three cadet teams being joined into one. fm dismissed the idea of joining the scouts when it was suggested, as she believed it to be too much of the obvious choice. ""“this is callsign: fm. cloak died in the blast. there are…sir, there are three of us left in the scout flight. the others died in the fighting.”-fm radioing in to ironsides, during the battle of alta second"" the week before graduation, the remaining members of skyward flight -- fm, spensa, and jorgen -- joined with nightmare flight during a routine debris tagging exercise. thoroughly unimpressed by the dismissive attitude of some of nightmare flight's pilots, fm and spensa gave a demonstration of their light-lancing skills after bog and tunestone attempted to condescendingly belittle the cadet's skills. during the mission, fm spotted the second half of the shipyard as it began descending from orbit. the group was set upon by krell, who had been scouting the shipyard, and took up a defensive position, providing aid to nightmare flight members when they were swarmed by enemy ships. during the battle, fm was able to destroy at least one krell ship by brute force, without needing to engage her imp. full pilot[edit] the next week, fm and jorgen graduated from flight school, along with six other cadets. as the ceremony ended, the newly promoted pilots joined the rest of the defiant fleet to go and defend the falling shipyard. fm joined the scouts for this mission, who were tasked with driving the krell bomber away from the ship, even if it meant sacrificing alta base. when the lifebuster increased its speed, fm and the scouts were ordered to engage the krell ship. they successfully destroyed the bomber, but at a great cost, with only three scouts, including fm, surviving the encounter. fm and the other two remaining scouts, joined with riptide flight and departed for alta base. once reaching the battle near alta, fm and jorgen were ordered by spensa to take down the bomber's shield, allowing kimmalyn to detach the lifebuster from the enemy ship. following the battle, fm took up a specialized piloting role in the reformed skyward flight. she accompanied spensa, kimmalyn, and sadie into battle against the krell shortly before the arrival of the superiority battleships. she was part of the battle against the krell when the delver and spensa arrived, and tried and failed to save lizard. after the battle, she discovered that jorgen had found several taynix, and she volunteered to help experiment on them. experimenting with the taynix[edit] when fm volunteered to help with the taynix experiments, jorgen assigned her the task of finding and retrieving any slugs that escaped. she eventually deduced that the yellow and blue taynix were hyperjumping out of their boxes. she quickly grew fond of the slugs, feeling protective of them. she named several of them, and encouraged jorgen to do the same. when jorgen picked up boomslug, fm warned him that he was squeezing it to hard, but jorgen ignored her. this resulted in boomslug mentally exploding and inflicting dozens of shallow cuts across jorgen’s face and arms. after she visited jorgen in the infirmary, fm and jorgen were told that they would be the first to speak with alanik since she fell unconscious. when alanik woke up, she spoke with fm using a translator pin to translate. fm answered alanik’s many questions, and alanik urgently warned her not to trust the superiority’s false peace. fm began to make headway, getting alanik to trust her more, however, jeshua and cobb soon entered and jeshua harshly demanded answers from alanik and threatened to keep her captive. alanik, angry, teleported away using her cytonic abilities. afterward, fm went to go find rig and found him in the platform control room trying to find the ftl communicator. he subtly tried to get her to leave, and fm asked him what he had against her. rig admitted that he liked fm, and they awkwardly changed the subject. they found the ftl communicator, a metal box like the one in m-bot’s ship, and they realized that if they put a taynix in it, they could use it for hyperspeed communication. they deduced through process of elimination that the purple and orange slugs were the ones that can be used as ftl communicators. fm theorized that maybe showing the slugs an image of a delver cytonically might trigger their abilities. jorgen sent gill an image of the delvers, and gill teleported away. jorgen tried putting gill in the special metal box that rig crafted which was similar to the one that was part of m-bot’s machinery. he tried scaring gill again while she was in the box, but nothing happened. they tried putting happy in instead, and happy teleported, this time taking jorgen with him, with jorgen appearing squeezed into a cubby, to the great amusement of fm and the others. they tried a similar experiment with fm and jorgen in a fighter, with moderate success. jorgen’s teleporting caught the attention of the superiority however, and they moved their battleships into position to bombard the planet and prevent the defiant peoples using the slugs to escape. fm and rig flew together in a dulo and listened to music as they flew towards the battle. they had a taynix in the fighter with them, and jorgen successfully teleported them close to the battleship’s main cannon. the cannon and its controls were shielded however, and fm was soon swarmed by krell. she was forced to retreat, and jorgen accidentally teleported her far back from the battle. the cannon began to fire, and cobb called a full retreat, while at the same time the engineering corps managed to get the planetary shield up, blocking battleship’s shots. fm hid until the rest of skyward flight came and met up with her outside the shield. after giving the taynix time to settle down, they all touched wings and jorgen teleported them inside the shield. after making it back to platform prime, rig and fm talked. rig informed her that they were going to try using fine to power the ftl communication device. as they walked, rig and fm discussed what they feared, and fm admitted that she was afraid of dying in battle and ceasing to exist. they discussed their days in flight school and the taynix, before the topic turned to their experiments. rig proposed that they try a different kind of experiment, and he and fm kissed briefly. fm and rig devised a new experiment, trying to train the slugs to teleport to a specific point, prompted by caviar. she called the target box ""home"", trying to get them to teleport there on command. she had moderate success, with some slugs being more motivated than others. they went to the command center, where cobb had succeeded in creating a call to cuna using a purple taynix as an ftl communicator. cuna told them that they were trapped on the research station of sunreach and under attack by about twenty krell fighters. they promised their aid if the humans were able to come and rescue them. after the communication ended, cobb went against jeshua’s will and ordered skyward flight to depart immediately. sunreach[edit] fm hurried to her fighter, and jorgen teleported all of skyward flight to sunreach using the coordinates cuna gave to him. they arrived at sunreach, and were greeted by the sight of an enormous space monster, which cuna identified as a mammoth starpod. a swarm of krell ships flew out to meet them in combat, and the fighting began. during the battle, jorgen's ship was destroyed, leaving fm to think he was dead. gill appeared in fm’s fighter, then teleported her into sunreach where she was reunited with jorgen, who had teleported out of his fighter just in time. when jorgen proposed that those in the station retreat and he would come back for skyward flight later, fm refused and told jorgen to send the taynix images of skyward flight’s members. the slugs teleported away and returned with their flight members, before they all hyperjumped back to starsight. after they arrived fm saw that a new shipment of caviar had arrived, the slugs’ favorite food. she cracked open several jars for the slugs, allowing them to eat their fill. helping alanik[edit] when alanik hyperjumped to detritus to speak with jorgen, she allowed fm to join them at jorgen’s request. fm and jorgen talk with alanik, who figure out much about the taynix. alanik wanted to form an alliance with the humans, and fm stayed with alanik and talked to her as jorgen went to talk to command. afterward they met with several of detritus’ leaders, including cobb and jeshua. jeshua decided to consult the national assembly, and alanik was given temporary quarters. a short time later, fm and jorgen visited alanik in her room, bringing food with them. other members of skyward flight arrived, and fm and the others discussed free will and the superiority with alanik. cobb came and told them that alanik’s request had been denied, but heavily hinted that he wanted them to go anyway. ""“are you coming with us? because if not, you should get back to engineering. you don’t want to be associated with what we’re about to do.”-fm to rig"" skyward flight and alanik went to their ships, fm giving alanik a ship and briefly explaining the controls to her. jeshua radioed them that they would be considered deserters if they left, but skyward flight left anyway, alanik hyperjumping them to redawn. jorgen ordered fm and a few others to fend off enemy pilots, while him, alanik, and the rest went to capture the unity shuttle that held alanik’s allies captive. when the unity pilots were freed, alanik takes them to their ships to join the fight, but more unity ships arrived. fm and the others fought, but were outnumbered. at alanik’s suggestion, they retreated to the weaponized, automatic flying platform, wandering leaf. fm and the others in the flight used their taynix to hyperjump underneath the platform’s guns, bringing independence pilots with them. skyward flight and the independence pilots met inside the platform, exchanging introductions. fm and the others listened to a unity broadcast, which features rinakin, alanik’s captured friend, allying himself with unity. after further discussion of what to do, fm wondered if the captured shuttle, which had belonged to the superiority, had a cytonic inhibitor onboard. they checked, and fm found a blue and green inhibitor taynix inside. they explored the platform’s control room, but didn’t know how to work it. they decided they needed rig’s expertise, so fm and alanik hyperjumped to detritus to retrieve him. they explained the situation, and asked him to come with them. rig agreed, and warned them that detritus’ leaders had started meeting with the superiority, and might agree to the superioirty’s demand to hand over their taynix, as well as their cytonics for “training”. they decided to bring many of the taynix with them back to wandering leaf, in order to save them from the superioirty. fm agreed with the plan, and alanik summoned them to her with her abilities. ""“the bigger plan may be to give the taynix to the superiority! i’m not going to let them do that. and if you are, then you are not my flightleader.”-fm arguing with jorgen"" they escaped back to wandering leaf with the taynix, but jorgen was furious that fm had taken the taynix. jorgen said that she had robbed ddf pilots of valuable assets, but fm said that it was the right thing to do, defending her actions. they then tested the taynix functions of the platform, fm helping figure out how to use the taynix in the various systems. after planning how to rescue rinakin, they hyperjump wandering leaf to a point outside tower, one of the biggest urdail cities. with the enemy distracted, alanik and arturo went to rescue rinakin while fm and skyward flight defended against the oncoming independence pilots. fm and the others delayed the independence pilots, trying to disrupt the urdail cytonics who had formed a cytonic inhibitor around wandering leaf. a superiority battleship arrived, armed with a planetary weapon that could destroy tower. after skyward flight shot down a few enemy cytonics, rig was able to hyperjump the platform right underneath the battleship, allowing the autoturrets to destroy it. a varvax cytonic hyperjumped onto wandering leaf, intending to seize the control room, and fm and several others converged on wandering leaf to try and help. rig used boomslug to defend himself however, boomslug’s mindblades slicing through the cytonic’s armor and making it retreat. fm was relieved, running out of her ship to hug rig. with the superiority battleship destroyed and with several of their cytonics defeated, the unity pilots retreated. cobb called them, and jorgen gave him an update. when cobb told them to return to detritus with some of the urdail officials, fm and jorgen thought cobb was acting suspicious. they decided that he was likely an imposter, having replaced cobb at one of the peace meetings. they contacted jeshua to tell her the news, but she didn’t believe them. alanik contacted gran-gran, who was being handed over to the superiority aboard a superiority ship. fm and the others came up with a plan, deciding to hyperjump wandering leaf to detritus, and board the superioirty ship where gran-gran, the real cobb, jorgen’s parents, and many of the national assembly leaders were. back to detritus[edit] they hyperjumped to detritus and alanik and jorgen went aboard the ship, fm staying behind on the platform with the rest of the flight in case they were needed to fly into combat. when alanik and jorgen failed, escaping back to wandering leaf as the ship exploded, fm tried to comfort jorgen. jorgen, angry and grieving after the loss of his parents, said that they were going down to platform prime, despite fm trying to get him to stop and think for a minute. as jorgen took skyward flight down to platform prime and stormed into vice admiral stoff’s office, fm tried to reason with him and get him to stop and calm down, but had no success. fm was involved in the planning to find and retrieve cobb and gran-gran, and then went with skyward flight to the kitsen planet of evershore meeting with the kitsen[edit] ""“other kitsen! i am a diplomatic representative from our people. we’re here to collect our lost friends and discuss an alliance. we’re not… invading anything, and we don’t mean to… sully your sands. ”-fm to the kitsen upon meeting goro"" as skyward flight initially met with the kitsen outside the city of dreamspring, first meeting with kauri and later with goro, jorgen put fm into the role of diplomat, and fm told the kitsen that the humans had no hostile intentions towards the kitsen. ""“stay here and maybe do some diplomacy.”-jorgen to fm before leaving to see cobb and gran-gran"" as jorgen, alanik, and kauri went to visit cobb and gran-gran at the medical tent, fm and the other members of skyward flight stayed behind with the kitsen hana, along with several other kitsen who were preparing a feast for the humans. fm insisted on having the flight help prepare the food, and so they did. fm went to the kitsen senate meeting with the others, listening in as the kitsen discussed the humans’ proposal of an alliance. after jorgen disrupted the meeting by spontaneously throwing out mindblades into the crowd, giving a speech, and leaving, fm followed after him to the beach. she sat down with him and forced him to talk about his parent’s death. fm convinced jorgen that their deaths weren’t his fault, easing the stress on his mind somewhat. while jorgen practiced his mindblades and worked on the mystery of gran gran’s and cobb’s coma, fm and many other members of skyward flight camped on the beach. the battle for evershore[edit] when a superiority carrier ship arrived and began an attack on the city of dreamspring, fm and the others in the flight got into their fighters to join the fray. at jorgen’s order, fm and the others protected the city itself, wanting to minimize civilian casualties and damage. as the battle progressed and the enemy gained reinforcements, fm and jorgen both landed on the beach, then used gill to hyperjump to detritus. ""“forget for a minute about what cobb ordered you to do. what do you think is the right thing to do?”-fm to jorgen about what to do at evershore"" they met up with rig, then went to stoff’s quarters, waking him and explaining the situation. they got permission to bring wandering leaf to help, along with several ddf flights. jorgen expressed doubt about his leadership and decision-making skills, but fm instilled him with more confidence, telling him to do what he thought was right. fm said a quick goodbye to rig before returning to evershore with jorgen, taking wandering leaf and several ddf flights with them. ""“but… we can see the closest island, off to the downward side. the ships are firing on the island. shouldn’t we… help them?”-fm showing concern for the other kitsen cities"" as more superiority ships arrived, fm continued to defend dreamspring, though when the superiority arrived with a lifebuster, jorgen ordered her and sentry to oversee the evacuation of the kitsen from the city. fm took the kitsen senators to safety, using the medical transport they had brought for cobb and gran-gran. aftermath[edit] when the superiority lost the battle, largely due to jorgen and rig hyperjumping the entire planet of detritus to a point outside evershore, fm returned to the outskirts of dreamspring, which had suffered from flooding. fm and jorgen met with stoff and cobb, the latter of whom jorgen had brought back to consciousness. jorgen wasn’t going to say anything, but fm told cobb the truth about stoff, how he shoved all the responsibility onto jorgen so that he wouldn’t get blamed if things went wrong. after reprimanding stoff, cobb had fm leave so him and jorgen could talk alone. ""“i hate the idea of the flight going out without me. i hate that i won’t be there to protect them.”-fm to jorgen about leaving active combat duty"" jorgen talked to fm afterward, telling her of his promotion to vice admiral. she was happy for him, and jorgen asked her if she would step down from active combat duty to be in charge of their diplomatic program. fm considered it and agreed, though she was reluctant to leave behind their flight and let them fly into battle without her. relationships[edit] spensa[edit] ""“...you can’t help being a product of your environment! it’s not your fault you’re a bloodthirsty ball of aggression and destruction. ”-fm describing how she see's spensa"" spensa admires fm for her fashion sense and outward appearance, finding the other girl to epitomize beauty standards. fm's confidence can at times intimidate spensa as it makes fm appear more mature and refined. spensa is never quite able to get past her nervousness even after they have finished flight school though nonetheless, spensa considers fm a close friend who truly understands her. fm finds a lot of spensa's bravado to come from indoctrination of the toxic and aggressive culture promoted by the defiants, however, appreciates the sincerity behind spensa's attitude, particularly after the deaths of bim and morningtide. she doesn't blame spensa for her attitude, believing it to be caused by the culture they live in - a sentiment that spensa does not agree with and struggles to understand. fm is dismissive of spensa's concerns about experiencing fear, likely because she does not understand spensa's underlying fears about being a coward. following the revelation that spensa's father was zeen nightshade, fm began acting more cautious around spensa, although it is unclear if this was because of her parentage or her temper. fm worries about spensa, particularly after the death of hurl, and takes it upon herself to regularly check in with her flight-mate. the departure of arturo set off worries in spensa, that fm might also be removed from flight school as, like arturo, her parents are influential and wealthy. after being dismissed from the ddf, spensa avoided all of her former flightmates, including fm. rodge[edit] ""“you will not tell her i said those things. she probably doesn’t even remember who i am....does she? ”-rodge talking to spensa after admitting he likes fm"" rodge has a crush on fm and thinks she is smart, cute, and has nice eyes. spensa, while playing matchmaker, asks fm about her dating preferences to see whether she would be interested in someone like rodge, although her attempts to find out information do not go very far. fm thinks rodge is cute, and wanted to get to know him better. because of his shyness, though, rodge felt very awkward around her and she thought he didn't like her, as he never looked her in the eye and rarely spoke to her. after she confronts him, asking what his problem is, he confesses that he has a crush on her, and apologizes for making her feel that he didn't like her. fm, though she finds rodge attractive, is worried about getting into a relationship because of the danger of her life as a pilot, knowing that any day, she could fly away and not come back. she tells rodge she doesn't know if she likes anyone, and he takes it as a gentle letdown. after this, rodge is able to talk to fm more and treats her more normally, and makes her heart skip when he smiles at her. when the superiority prepares to fire on detrius with planetary weapons, fm and rodge ride together in the dulo. when the planetary shield goes up, they, the rest of skyward flight, and a couple of other pilots are trapped outside until they rendezvous to hyperjump back inside. during the wait, fm tells rodge that she's more sure about her feelings now, and takes his hand, much to his delight. after the battle, fm is stressed and worrying about the taynix. rodge talks to her, and helps her feel better. she kisses him after he helps her up. they work together to experiment with the taynix, and rodge agrees with fm in that the slugs are alive and more than just tools. rodge is worried when fm leaves on missions, and fm is worried about hurting him if she doesn't come back, but she decides that there's little point in staying alive if one doesn't have much to live for. with this thought, she decides to continue her relationship with rodge despite the danger of her situation. fm and rodge used their taynix to meet quietly, because they weren't ready to tell everyone that they were dating yet. they are close, and fm enjoys helping rodge with his engineering projects, or at least watching him work. nedd[edit] nedd had a crush on fm. they have a playful relationship, often exchanging friendly insults and joking comments. nedd had hoped to celebrate with fm after her graduation and was disappointed that she had immediately been sent on a ddf mission. while they were on leave, he cornered fm and asked her out, but she told him she'd rather just be friends. he took it well, though after that he acted overly friendly in an effort not to make their friendship awkward, though, for fm, it had the opposite effect. this slightly exasperated fm, who tried to avoid that in the first place by not directly confronting nedd. fm seems to perceive nedd as rather socially oblivious, as he didn't pick up on her hints that she wasn't interested in him. later in redawn fm expresses to the whole flight -after they bombard her with questions- that she and roge are dating. nedd then becomes speechless and a few moments later says he feels left out since almost everyone in the flight has a girlfriend or boyfriend now. notes[edit]"
Heimline,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Heimline,"""“i’m not sure i’d wish this command on them, not even the ones i hated. ”-ironsides when asked by cobb if she wished someone else had survived"" admiral heimline is a pilot in the ddf. it is unclear whether heimline was a junior or senior admiral. heimline fought against the krell in the battle of alta. heimline did not survive the battle, however, if they did, they would have been considered a first citizen. ironsides may have greatly disliked heimline, however, it is unclear. notes[edit]"
Southern Scadrian,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Southern_Scadrial,"""“the land was soft and warm, and now it is harsh and broken and frozen. ”-allik neverfar describing the events that nearly destroyed his people"" the southern scadrians are a culture on scadrial. they were placed at the south pole by the lord ruler during his ascension. when he moved the planet closer to the sun, he altered the physiology of the skaa to enable them to survive the ash and the warmer temperatures. however, he also placed an unaltered group of scadrians at the south pole to act as a control group for his genetic experiments. the southern scadrians lived there without any interaction with the final empire for over a thousand years until the catacendre. when harmony moved the planet back to its original orbit and orientation, it caused a change in climate that the southern scadrians failed to adapt to. the southern scadrians were at the brink of extinction until they were rescued by the sovereign. history[edit] relocation to the south pole (pre final empire, circa 1025 anteverdant)[edit] during his ascension, the lord ruler moved scadrial out of its original orbit, putting it closer to the sun in order to burn off the deepness. the planet's surface became too hot, forcing the lord ruler to move inhabited lands to the north and south poles. in the north, a combination of the planet's magnetic field and ferromagnetic ash from the ashmounts shielded the land from the heat of the sun. the final empire was at the northern magnetic pole of the planet, which moved from its physical location with the relocation of the well of ascension to a middle latitude. the genetic alterations made to the skaa allowed them to adapt to the constant ashfalls. however, the lord ruler also placed an unaltered group of people at the physical south pole. these people were placed there by the lord ruler as a reserve in case his genetic modifications of humanity failed. the lord ruler managed to find a way other than genetic modifications or ashmounts to help them survive in the world he created. the southern peoples had the seeds of the metallic arts, though since none of them had ingested lerasium, allomancers were extremely rare and mistborn completely unheard of. because of this, instead of using the metallic arts in a way based on genetics like the people of the final empire, the southern peoples use them in a more ""mechanical way."" the ice death (catacendre)[edit] in the north, about three years after the death of the lord ruler, sazed took up both of the planet's shards and ascended, becoming harmony. harmony tried undoing most of the lord ruler's changes, setting the continents back in their original places and moving scadrial back into its original orbit, removing the need for heat-lessening solutions like the ashmounts. this event was known to the northern scadrians as the catacendre or ""end of the ash."" because of this, the weather in the southern continent became colder. the southern peoples could not adapt to this change, and many died from the cold. southern scadrians call this event the ice death. years had gone by and the ice death did not end. the southern peoples failed to recover from it on their own, leading to the almost complete collapse of their society. the reason for this failure is not known, but expeditions from the south to the north have notably shown that southern peoples still feel unnaturally cold even in northern scadrian weather. the sovereign (12 years post-catacendre)[edit] eventually, a man appeared among the southern scadrians offering them help. he gave them devices called the excisors, which allowed them to create medallions that granted the power of feruchemical heat. this new technology enabled them to survive the cold. this man became known as the sovereign, ruling over his southern scadrian followers. he started the tradition of the firemothers and firefathers, people who live only to fill the medallions with heat. after a period of time, the sovereign took the bands of mourning and hid them in a temple in the mountains of northern scadrial. his priests travelled with him, then returned to the southern continent to pass on the legend of the bands. although the sovereign has been rumored to be the lord ruler himself, he was in fact another man from northern scadrial named kelsier. looking for the bands (336-337 years post-catacendre)[edit] as the southern scadrians began scouting farther and farther north using their airships, they eventually discovered the lands of the elendel basin. the hunters sent a large expedition to the north, looking for the temple where the sovereign left the bands of mourning. they intended to use an ettmetal bomb to destroy the bands. though most of the expedition perished, supposedly in a blizzard, one skimmer managed to return to the southern continent and tell their story. however, waxillium ladrian believes that some of the crew, desiring the power of the bands, betrayed the others and attempted to take the bands for themselves. this attempt was unsuccessful due to the traps at the temple. first encounters with the northern scadrians (341-342 years post-catacendre)[edit] ironsights, an exploration vessel thought lost, returned to elendel with a refugee they picked up who told stories of ""people of the oceans"". the refugee claims to have encountered these people in a distant land when they attacked his ship. he described these ""people of the oceans"" as a violent seafaring race who have access to ""unknown metals"". soon after that, lady nicelle sauvage, a citizen of southern roughs city new seran, reported briefly glimpsing a figure in a mountain range in the roughs, describing it as having ""piercing eyes, and a face like some otherwordly beast"". the two cultures fully intersected once jordis took a second airship, brunstell, on an expedition north to find the temple of the sovereign. the ship was hit by a powerful storm and crashed near the village of dulsing. their ship was discovered by the set and the crew was taken captive and interrogated. the set learned of the medallion technology, as well as the legend of the bands of mourning, and began preparing an expedition into the mountains to find the temple. at the same time, the kandra reluur was attempting to find the bands in the same mountain range. though the set accosted him and took one of his spikes, he was able to return to elendel and alert the other kandra of what he had witnessed. the kandra asked wax and marasi colms to investigate reluur's claims. the two, along with their band of adventurers, discovered the location where the set was holding the southern scadrians and helped one of them, allik neverfar, to escape on a small airship, wilg. the set and wax's group raced to find the temple, each hoping to be the first to claim the bands. ultimately, wax and his friends found the bands first and defeated the set, freeing the remaining southern scadrians from captivity. steris harms negotiated a trade agreement between the north and the south, establishing the first official relationship between the two peoples. culture[edit] the southern scadrians have a tradition of wearing masks, with each of the five peoples of the continent having its own mask-wearing rules and customs. they have natural low body temperatures, which is related to their cold intolerance. there is also a group called the deniers of masks that the other southern scadrians oppose, but nothing is known about them other than the fact that they are very dangerous. the sovereign had priests accompanying him who did not belong to any of the current southern peoples living. not much is known about them. nations[edit] the southern scadrians were divided into five different nations, however following the discovery of the northern scadrians their politics changed until they united under the banner of single nation, the malwish consortium. so far, the names of three of these previous nations have been revealed: malwish[edit] the malwish wear red masks that change according to their profession or their mood. allik neverfar and jordis are malwish. dancing is very important to them, so much so that they have been known to give harsh (although friendly) punishment just for getting the steps to a dance wrong. following the discovery of the northern continent, the malwish took over diplomatic relations with the basin, and the majority of southerners who visited the north were from there. they were the only tribe who sent an ambassador up. it is under their banner that the southern nations united. some of the researchers on canticle view malwish as a civilized language. the hunters[edit] the people known as the hunters receive one mask at birth, which is replaced by a second mask upon reaching adulthood. this second mask eventually grows into the skin. the hunters were warriors before the ice death, but now they search for the cause of the cataclysm that ruined their society. they took an airship to find the bands of mourning, intending to destroy them. iyatil, a silverlight born woman with southern scadrian ancestry, wears a mask reminiscent of those worn by the hunters nation. the fallen[edit] the former rulers of the southern scadrians became known as the fallen after they lost their authority due to the ice death, which is seen as their divine punishment. a member of the fallen wears a plain, unpainted mask until he earns the right to wear an ornate one through some great achievement. the fallen were the kings before the ice death, and their simple masks are a punishment for having offended the jaggenmire. the maskless[edit] a people in the far south, on a separate landmass from the elendel basin and malwish consortium. it is unknown if this is one nation, or a collection of peoples. they are not part of the malwish consortium. they are most likely the deniers of masks mentioned by allik, who actively shun masks and are considered quite dangerous by the rest of southern scadrial. religion[edit] the southern scadrians worship the jaggenmire, an entity composed of two beings who are always one and always apart. the jaggenmire is made up of herr and his sister-wife frue. the southern scadrians believe that herr can make things go and frue can make things stop, though neither can make life on their own. they think of the jaggenmire as acausal, having always been separate, and always been together, simultaneously. these concepts have been compared to preservation and ruin, and how both now exist in harmony. the southern scadrians believe that their kings did something to offend the jaggenmire, causing the ice death. the southern scadrians also worship the sovereign, the person who saved them following the ice death. he taught them to revere metalborn, who they consider pieces of god. they believe that he created the bands of mourning and hid them in the mountains for him to use upon his return. some clans believe that this warning was intended as a test and that the southern scadrians have to prove themselves by finding the bands. others, the hunters, believe that the bands should be destroyed. the southern scadrians believe that hell is up in the sky. they believe that, since below ground is warmer, hell must be the opposite direction. they have stories of the kandra. technology[edit] the southern scadrians are more technologically advanced than the northern scadrians in many ways. the sovereign gives them the excisors, devices that allow them to create medallions, a type of unsealed metalmind, that grant the power of feruchemical brass. they later reverse-engineer these medallions to grant other feruchemical powers. notably, they use iron medallions to allow many people to store their weight, leading to their development of airships. the process of creating the medallions requires both metalborn and the excisors. the southern scadrians also constructed medallions with several types of metal, granting the wearer several feruchemical powers at once. wearing multiple medallions at once does not work, as the medallions interfere with each other. exactly how medallions are made is a trade secret within the malwish consortium. when the crew of the brunstell is saved they are given guns by allik and steris to fight the set. a short time later they are seen wielding the weapons, so it’s safe to assume they know how guns work, which shows that they have guns in the south as well.[citation needed] while talking to wax, harmony reflects on the limited progress the people of elendel have made since the remaking of scadrial due to the benevolent environment of the basin, mentioning ""...others, who were nearly destroyed"", and implies they are significantly more advanced than those in the basin. they have access to ettmetal, a.k.a. harmonium. among other things, ettmetal is used to fuel the southern airships. notable people[edit] trivia[edit] - they are mysteriously referred to in - annotations, - suggesting that something is perhaps there. later, brandon

Dan Wells,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Dan_Wells,"dan wells is a novelist and collaborator of brandon sanderson. a long-time friend and former roommate of brandon's, he is collaborating with brandon on multiple projects, including the apocalypse guard and some parts of the dark one franchise. they are also both hosts on the writing excuses podcast and have their own separate podcast, currently titled intentionally blank. works[edit] dan's first published novel was i am not a serial killer, published in 2009. since then, he has written several sequels to that book, the partials sequence, the mirador series, the zero-g series of audio originals, and several other stand-alone books. collaboration[edit] dan has been a part of brandon's writing group since it was created, and in that role has presumably provided significant feedback to brandon on his books. the soldier wellen in mistborn era 1 and one of his descendants, the member of the set wellid in mistborn era 2, are cameos for dan; the constable wells in mistborn era 2 may be as well. after brandon wrote the first draft of the apocalypse guard in late 2017, he felt that the book wasn't working right and decided it put it aside and write the skyward series for the published that was promised the apocalypse guard instead. he then reached out to dan, who he considered ""the best writer"" he knew to see if dan could help him fix it. as a result of their collaboration, the book got ""weirder"" and by late 2019, they considered it to be ""pretty good,"" but it still had some issues and they decided to shelve it for the time being. in april 2021, brandon indicated he might work on getting the book into shape between when he finishes the fifth book of the stormlight archive and when mistborn era 3 is ready to be released. brandon has also indicated that he would likely work with dan on dark one: prophetic histories, the audio novelization of brandon's original dark one outline. in august 2021, dan commented that he was collaborating with brandon on dark one: forgotten, a serial-style podcast about a journalist tracking a serial killer, and had finished work on the project. in september 2022, brandon and dan revealed that dan was going to be joining dragonsteel entertainment as vice president of narrative. external links[edit] notes[edit]"
Shu-Dereth,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Do-Dereth,"shu-dereth is a religion practiced on the selish continent known as opelon (aonic term) or sycla (fjordell term). during the events of elantris, it is the official religion of all nations east of the dathreki mountains; arelon and teod are the only nations within the “known world” that remain holdouts. beliefs[edit] the derethi worship an unforgiving god known as jaddeth, who rules from a throne beneath the earth. the central tenet of the faith is the achievement of unity of all mankind under the rule of one nation. - jaddeth rewards ambition. - jaddeth is intolerant of ignorance. - the only difference between man and animal is mankind’s ability to worship jaddeth; beasts are only capable of serving their lusts, whereas mankind is capable of devotion to a higher purpose. - service to jaddeth is rewarded during life as well as in the afterlife. - fjordell is jaddeth's chosen tongue, and therefore is holy, and all others are tantamount to profanity. - only one man - the wyrn - serves jaddeth directly. all others serve through a chain of command (see - for more information). religious texts[edit] derethi scriptures are contained in the do-dereth, though they also study the text of their parent religion, the do-kando of shu-keseg. organization & hierarchy[edit] the religion of shu-dereth is very regimented, and its structure has been compared to that of a feudal government system. followers are expected to obey the commands of their superiors, and priests are expected to give orders rather than shepherd others on the path to faith. a formal example of this type of relationship is that of the odivs, krondets, and hrodens. members of the derethi priesthood can elect to become a hroden, or master, taking on one or more odivs and/or krondets. krondet is the less restrictive form of servitude, where the krondet listens to the counsel of his hroden but is not bound to do as told. odivs, however, must follow the orders of their hroden, essentially serving as a slave. many choose the role of odiv in order to gain power through their connection to their hroden. chain to jaddeth[edit] the derethi believe that only one man - the wyrn, or ruler, of fjorden - can serve jaddeth directly. all others serve only those in the position directly above them in the chain that links all people to lord jaddeth. this prevents those in the lower ranks from having to worry about commands of jaddeth that are beyond their capacity to understand. - the - of fjorden is the only member of the church who serves jaddeth directly. - the wyrn commands all followers of shu-dereth, and is able to consent to using what are considered ""heathen magics"" to further the empire, and give certain followers permission to use them as well. - a - , the leader of a monastery, is generally considered to be outside of the chain because gragdets generally don’t involve themselves in matters outside of their monastery. - however, gragdets of the most powerful monasteries (rathbore, dakhor, and fjeldor) rank above gyorn. - is the highest level of the derethi priesthood except in cases where the gragdet of a powerful monastery elects to become active in the affairs of the church at large. the twenty gyorns - of the fjordell empire are amongst the most noble in standing; kings bow to gyorns in nations where shu-dereth is practiced. - they are known to serve as ambassadors to foreign nations, such as - and the - . - they customarily wear red ornamental armor with billowing crimson cloaks. - they are typically old, with even hrathen, a man in his forties, being considered young for a gyorn. - as they are deeply devoted and trusted, they are trusted by the wyrn to use - for the purposes of communication with the wyrn when on missions in other countries. - is the rank directly below gyorn; - they usually oversee a region of derethi worshippers. - a priest must be of at least this level to command rathbore-trained priests without the wyrn’s permission. - is the rank below ragnat; - they generally lead chapels in large cities. - an - is a full derethi priest. this is the lowest rank of priest that can lead a chapel on his own. - many arteths can be assigned to one chapel with a “head arteth” leading them. - is the lowest level of derethi priest; - though arteths may have some authority over the dorven, they officially serve the gradors. - reside at the bottom of the chain and serve the arteths and the dorven, becoming a part of the chain of command by swearing themselves as odiv or krondet to one of said arteths or dorven. monasteries[edit] ""“for centuries, the derethi priesthood had been training its monks in war, assassination, and…other arts. ”-hrathen, reflecting on the impact derethi monks could have on arelon"" entering derethi priests are required to join a monastery for training related to both religion and combat. most monasteries, like ghajan, the monastery hrathen attended after leaving dakhor, train simple soldiers. others, however, provide more specialized training: - the - trains spies. - the - trains assassins. - - priests below the level of ragnat must acquire permission from the wyrn prior to using rathbore priests. - potential members may be required to kill someone before being admitted, as - was required to kill hrathen before being admitted. - the - , also referred to as “the order of bone,” trains vicious warriors that hrathen refers to as “demons.” - dakhor monks gain enhanced abilities, such as an increase in speed or strength, as a result of the bony patterns that grow under their skin. origins & history[edit] split from shu-keseg[edit] shu-dereth developed when one of keseg’s students, dereth, set out from jindo to spread shu-keseg’s central tenet of unity of all mankind, teaching that it should be achieved by uniting all mankind under one nation. these teachings were later used as the basis for a new faction of shu-keseg, named shu-dereth after its founder. establishment in fjorden[edit] dereth’s ideas were originally rejected in his native jindo; however, they were embraced by the fjordell. shu-dereth has been the official religion of fjorden since the reported conversion of wyrn wulfden the first and has spread to all of the eastern nations. since that time, the leader of shu-dereth takes the title wyrn upon his ascension, which serves as both a political and a religious title. cultural impacts[edit] - all are welcome within jaddeth’s empire, but the fjordell are most welcome. - fjordell is jaddeth’s chosen language; it is holy while others are profane. ""“like two plants competing for the same ground, shu-dereth would strangle shu-korath.”-hrathen"" trivia[edit] - in the planned sequel to elantris, wyrn decides to reinterpret scripture to suggest that only the nations to the east of the - needed to be derethi for jaddeth to return, so it is possible that the day of empire will occur during the - . notes[edit]"
Vamah princedom,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Vamah_princedom,"vamah princedom is one of ten alethi princedoms of alethkar. vamah's house colors are brown & grey. geography[edit] vamah princedom is located in the north-west portion of the country and boarders jah keved to the west, sadeas princedom to the north, aladar princedom to the north-east and ruthar princedom to the east and the south. the windrunner river runs along the entirety of the eastern boarder and marks the the boundary with aladar princedom and part of ruthar princedom. grass grows to a much longer length in vamah princedom than in central alethkar, reaching to approximately waist height. ryshadium are rarely found in the eastern pricedoms, however, there are occasional sightings. locations[edit] history[edit] vamah princedom was one of the ten princedoms reunited into a single country under gavilar kholin. its highprince resisted unification for most of gavilar's campaign, though by the time direct conflict occurred, the region was close to flipping its allegiances. the kholin defeat of highlord kalanor's army, marked the turning point and subsequent end of the war for unification. after the coming of the everstorm, the city of revolar is conquered by the singers and parshmen throughout the nearby regions begin to converge on the city. both kaladin and moash pass through revolar (though at different points in time) after it has been claimed by the singers. before his arrival in revolar, kaladin and a group of parshmen shelter from a highstorm at a waystop within the lands of highlord cadilar. politics[edit] government[edit] loradar vamah succeeded kalanor as highprince in the year 1145 after kalanor was killed by dalinar kholin. this transfer of power was engineered by gavilar kholin during his campaign to unify alethkar, as loradar was sympathetic to his cause and would swear fealty to house kholin. highlord paladar, a relative of the highprince, is named as regent when the alethi declare war on the parshendi and march to the shattered plains. military[edit] after the death of king gavilar kholin in 1167, highprince vamah calls to arms the people of his kingdom to fulfil the vengeance pact. in farcoast there is a high response to the call for enlistment, with every one in two men of age joining the army. citizens[edit] - highprince - highlord - highlord - highlord - brightlady notes[edit]"
Allomancy,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Allomantic,"""“allomancy is brutal, raw, and powerful ”-khriss in ""on the three metallic arts"""" allomancy is the most widely used form of investiture on scadrial, and is locally known as one of the three metallic arts. people who have one or more allomantic abilities are called allomancers with each allomantic power being paired with a type of metal, which must be ingested and ""burned"" to activate. mechanics[edit] ""“allomancy, obviously, is of preservation. the rational mind will see this. for, in the case of allomancy, net power is gained. it is provided by an external source--preservation's own body. ”-harmony on allomancy"" allomancy is an end-positive magic system, which draws on the power of preservation, channeled through a metal when it is burned. this differs to how feruchemy works, as allomancy is not being powered by the body of the allomancer, but instead by an external force. like the other metallic arts, allomancy as a magic system formed through the natural interactions between the two shards that inhabit scadrial, preservation and ruin, and the planet itself, instead of being created by a specific shard. this magic system, however, is generally tailored and fuelled by preservation, although specific cases will involve an allomancer drawing upon ruin's essence instead. like other forms of investiture, allomancy does not necessarily reflect the intent of the shard which it is associated with. allomantic metals are the focus, but not the source, of allomancy's power. when an allomancer burns a metal, that metal's specific molecular structure acts as a conduit to preservation, and then the allomancer is granted an ability corresponding to the metal, allowing the metal to ""focus"" preservation's power to the user. each metal is the only way a mortal can access preservation and the power of creation, after which it is vaporized. however, this is only true for the base sixteen allomantic metals and not god metals or their alloys. allomancers feel a reserve of power in their stomach when they have ingested a metal they can burn. the metals are usually ingested by drinking specifically prepared metal vials, which contain metal flakes suspended in an alcohol solution or other such liquid, e.g. cod oil. while swallowing metal is the most common way of getting metal into the body, other ways such as injecting or snorting will also work. when using their powers, many allomancers describe a warm feeling in the stomach, hence the term ""burning metal"". an allomancer can also burn their metals at an accelerated rate, which is called ""flaring."" flaring grants more power, but the reserve of metals depletes much faster, too. allomancers can burn metals from any planet in the cosmere. this is due to the presence of preservation in the spiritual realm. allomancers can suffer side-effects from leaving metal in their bodies for too long, and they normally burn their remaining ingested metals before sleeping to avoid this. despite this, due to their physiology, allomancers are generally immune to metal poisoning. they are not immune to metal allergies, however. advanced allomancy can be combined with feruchemy to gain faster-than-light travel. it is possible to use allomancy in the cognitive realm. burning metals containing biochromatic breath has no effect on the allomancy, although if the breath belongs to the allomancer it will be regained. if an allomancer burns an invested metal which is allomantically inert, it will not have any special effect apart from possibly killing the allomancer. allomancers will still feel a reserve of power in their stomach from badly mixed alloys, and burning them will make them sick, giving them a blinding headache. gaining allomantic abilities[edit] allomancy is a spiritually hereditary trait, that does not follow the same principles of dominant and recessive physical genetics. scadrians with mixed skaa-noble heritage generally must have a noble in the previous five generations in order to be born an allomancer. the ability lays dormant until an allomancer undergoes snapping, which will activate their allomantic abilities. the abilities can be used instinctually, including while unconscious, once awakened if the user is to ingest the correct type of metal, though training is required to use these powers well. snapping does not affect the chances of having an allomancer child. twins are more likely to have the same metal, especially if they are identical instead of fraternal. it is possible to gain allomancy through the use of hemalurgic spikes where the spiritual dna associated with allomancy is transferred from one soul to another. if an allomancer attempts to burn a hemalurgic spike, the allomancer's spiritual dna will be spliced to that of the person's contained in the spike. the consequences of this are as of yet unknown. additionally, consuming a bead of lerasium will hardcode allomancy into a person's spiritweb and grant them allomantic abilities. the size of the bead that is consumed is proportional to the strength of their allomancy. snapping[edit] in the final empire, children of confirmed noble bloodlines often undergo a planned beating as a test to see if they snap, as snapping commonly occurs when a misting or mistborn undergoes heavy stress and pain, often in a near-death situation, causing them to trigger latent allomantic abilities. according to realmatic theory, this creates a crack on the soul which the power can fit into. there are some similarities on this to other magic systems, such as the knights radiant all being ""broken"" as indicated by syl. it was possible for allomancers to snap from intense positive emotion, but this is much less common. it is also possible to snap from false emotions, caused by soothing and rioting. it was said that the more powerful the allomancer, the more intense the trauma had to be to snap. after the final ascension, harmony changed the way snapping operated, but it is unknown how it was altered. after an allomancer has snapped, they will have access to their full power, and do not have to build to reach their full potential such as with surgebinding. mist sickness[edit] in the run up to the catacendre, however, the mists cause sickness in people, triggering their own snapping; this process is started by preservation, but is manipulated by ruin into killing people, thus raising superstitions about the mists being dangerous. the length a person has ""mist sickness"" relates to their allomantic powers and abilities. the most powerful atium mistings are sick for the longest time. during the time the mists are snapping people in the hero of ages, they also raise the allomantic potential of the people they snap so that exactly 16% are snapped. the number is a hint left by preservation for humans to understand. savantism[edit] allomancers who flare their metal intensely for extended periods of time may be physiologically altered by the constant influx of allomantic power. these people are known as allomantic savants. these people experience heightened ability with, and heightened dependence upon, whatever metal they are burning in such a manner. under most circumstances, this was considered irreversibly damaging. types of allomancers[edit] ""“never try to burn a metal that isn't one of the ten. i warned you that impure metals and alloys can make you sick. well, if you try to burn a metal that isn't allomantically sound at all, it could be deadly. ”-kelsier to vin"" allomancers are categorized based on if they can burn a single metal, misting, or if they can burn all metals, mistborn, with hemalurgy being the only known way to access a combination powers that falls outside of this categorizations structure. each type of misting was given a particular name depending on their ability, such as lurcher, coinshot, or soother. an allomancer's lineage does not usually play a factor in which kind of misting they are. throughout the ages, the strength of an allomancer has slowly decreased, weakening a bit with each generation. this dilution of power eventually caps and cannot decrease any further; there was no apparent power dilution between era 1 and era 2, and it was confirmed that the dilution has completely capped by era 3. people who use lerasium can gain the strength of ancient, powerful allomancers. twinborn and compounders[edit] after the final empire, terris and those of noble descent began to interbreed, so it became possible for their descendants to have one allomantic ability and one feruchemical ability. people with such powers were called twinborn. like mistings, twinborn were each given a name depending on their specific combination of abilities. the interaction between the two abilities creates a new, secondary effect, known as a resonance. a compounder is a special type of twinborn--a person who uses the same metal for both their allomantic and feruchemical abilities. a compounder can allomantically burn their feruchemically charged metalmind, gaining a massive burst of the stored feruchemical attribute. compounders were considered immensely powerful. though the term ""compounding"" first appeared in scadrian vocabulary after the final empire, perhaps the most famous compounder was the lord ruler himself--by constantly compounding atium, pewter, and gold, he was eternally young, supernaturally strong, and basically unkillable. allomantic metals[edit] the following is the modern table of allomantic metals, from some point after the catacendre. ""“there are two metals for every power. one pushes, one pulls--the second is usually an alloy of the first. for emotions--the external mental powers--you pull with zinc and push with brass. you just used pewter to push your body. that's one of the internal physical powers. ”-kelsier to vin."" there are sixteen basic allomantic metals. the metals come in pairs: one metal is a periodic element, while the other is the alloy of that base metal. these pairs have complementary effects. iron pulls on nearby metals, while its alloy, steel, pushes on metals. similarly, each elemental metal is classified as a ""pulling"" ability, whereas each alloy is classified as a ""pushing"" ability. the purity of the metal corresponds to its effectiveness and alloys require precise compound percentages for maximum power. burning an impure alloy may cause sickness, while metals that are not allomantically viable cannot be burned after being ingested. in addition to pulling and pushing classifications, there are external and internal metals. external powers influence things outside an allomancer's body, while internal powers influence the allomancer. this naturally divides the sixteen allomantic metals into four groups of four metals each: physical, mental, temporal, and enhancement powers. each quadrant has a metal and alloy pair of an external power, and another pair of internal powers. the allomantic effects of metals are most similar to the effects of fabrials on roshar. steel and iron also have corresponding effects in how they affect aether, whether other allomantic metals also have effects or not is currently unknown. god metals[edit] god metals do not fit in the modern allomantic table, and scadrians appear to only know of the metals that correspond to the scadrian shards; lerasium, atium, and ettmetal, the last of which could only be burned theoretically, as it explodes upon contact with liquids. unlike the standard allomantic metals, which are regular metal elements and compounds, god metals are a condensed, solid form of pure investiture. alloys of god metals can lead to additional abilities. history[edit] at some point, preservation altered allomancy to insert ruin's god metal, atium, instead of one of the other metals in order to execute his plan to defeat ruin using atium mistings. the shard's plan eventually came to fruition during the battle of hathsin when elend's army consumed a large proportion of the existing atium, preventing ruin from accessing his full power. prior to the ascension of the lord ruler, allomancy was rarely found among the general population. the lord ruler's ascension, and his subsequent distribution of the lerasium beads, increased the strength of the allomantic spiritual dna in the final empire, which had long lasting effects through the subsequent generations. rashek, and his steel ministry, also suppressed knowledge of several of the allomantic metals, so that only the four physical, four mental, gold, and atium, were known of by the general populace. malatium became known through legend as the eleventh metal, a rumor that may have been started by ruin to help facilitate the downfall of the lord ruler. prior to its destruction, atium and malatium were incorrectly classified as temporal metals instead of god metals by the lord ruler and his government. following the final ascension, harmony altered snapping to act differently. the allomantic table also changed at this time to remove ruin's metals, with advances in technology also making cadmium, bendalloy, chromium, and nicrosil more available. notable allomancers[edit] development[edit] allomancy was present in the original version of mistborn (now known as mistborn prime). in that version, allomancy only had mistborn and no mistings. mistborn prime was never published, and brandon later repurposed its good ideas into mistborn: the final empire. to give this new mistborn book a heist novel feel, brandon added mistings, so that he could have a team of specialists with their own unique strengths. the metals themselves changed over time. brandon had been misled by employees of a hobby shop in his childhood that pewter was an alloy of silver, so in the original draft of mistborn, silver and pewter were paired, and he named silver mistings silvereyes. when he realized the factual error, he was forced to change it to tin and tineye. brandon always thought silvereye sounded much ""slicker"" than tineye. and so silver just happened to not have any allomantic effect in the final form of allomancy. after the original trilogy and brandon's reveal that atium and malatium did not belong on the true table of allomantic metals, brandon chose the true external temporal metal to be cadmium, as it was particularly dangerous and hard to acquire, so it made sense that only scadrians with the technology after the final ascension could discover it. brandon originally had cadmium's alloy named cerrobend, but that name happened to be trademarked, so brandon was forced to change it to the generic word, bendalloy. the error was present on an early version of the table of allomantic metals. external links[edit] notes[edit]"
Savant,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Savantism,"a savant is someone who has used an investiture-related ability so much that it has changed their physiology; at least allomancy, feruchemy, and surgebinding can lead to savants. the process involves one's spirit becoming infused with investiture, causing changes in the physical realm. savantism brings a person closer to the spiritual realm. allomantic savant[edit] an allomancer who has flared their metal for a long time can become a savant. generally, savantism gives the allomancer more blunt power and sometimes grants additional special effects. it is dangerous and harmful to the body. the allomancer might rely so much on or get so accustomed to the metal that when they extinguish the metal, they experience serious withdrawal effects. with most metals, the effects are quite small. seekers, for example, often become savants without being aware of it, granting them a boost to the range of their abilities. however, some metals warp the body of savants much more. tin savants experience such magnification of their senses that they can become incapacitated by bright light or loud sounds. pewter mistings often die before becoming savants, as they feel neither pain nor exhaustion to any great extent and therefore may ignore wounds that later prove fatal. pewter savants heal quickly, though not as fast as someone tapping health from a goldmind. spook is an allomantic savant. he flares his tin for so long that he can sense things as minute as the wind of a sword's passing. however, his senses are so enhanced that any light is too bright for him, forcing him to wear a blindfold, and he keeps his ears stuffed with wool to block out noises. if someone were able to burn the amount of lerasium needed to become a savant with the metal, they would ascend and become the vessel of preservation, similar to what happens when one consumes the mists. this is due to the nature of the metal as the condensed power of preservation. feruchemical savant[edit] since feruchemy doesn't draw from an external power, it is very difficult to become a savant. if the feruchemist is able to compound and draw power from an outside source they could become one. surgebinding savant[edit] every surge can cause a surgebinder to become a savant. soulcasting savant[edit] soulcasting savants begin to take on the physical characteristics of the substances that they produce with soulcasting. for example, ardents responsible for construction on the shattered plains begin to look like stone or crystal, kaza's body starts turning into smoke, and ithi and her sister have vines growing under their skin in part from constantly producing grain during the siege of kholinar. both surgebinder soulcasters and users of soulcaster fabrials can become savants, though the effects are much less pronounced for surgebinders, as the nahel bond offers some protection. notable savants[edit] - ( - , former) - ( - and - ) - ( - ) - ( - ) - ( - ) trivia[edit] - savants look different in the - compared to a regular human. - the extra abilities gained by a savant cannot be transferred through - . - ability to create a "" - "" to deflect metal moving around him - was originally intended to be the result of him being a savant in the - between his - and - . brandon later backed up on that, as he realized wax was not manifesting the usual consequences of savantism. notes[edit]"
Navani's journal,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Navani%27s_journal,"navani kholin's journal is an autobiographical account of history of her life on roshar, notably including the events surrounding the assassination of gavilar and the coming of the everstorm. she keeps a separate notebook related to her scholarly research. history[edit] navani's scholarly background meant that her journals were very thorough; she sometimes wrote down multiple accounts of the same event if she believed that the details were important. she also recorded more trivial information, such as her favorite wine vintages. she had an unknown number of journals, and she kept them all so that she could refer back to them later. gavilar's death, 1167[edit] navani's journals from around the time of her husband gavilar's death were particularly important, as she had a unique perspective on the king's unusual actions. gavilar had become increasingly distracted from his royal duties and was clearly hiding something from navani, causing friction between the couple. navani's anger and frustration led to an attempt to covertly observe gavilar; she walked in on him discussing some unusual spheres with nale and kalak. he flatly refused to explain himself, instead offering only withering criticism. after gavilar's death, navani recounted the day's events on six different occasions in her journals, noting that her emotional state was different each time she was writing. as the true desolation began, she referred back to these journals on dozens of occasions, unsuccessfully seeking clues to explain gavilar's cryptic final words and actions. coming of the everstorm, 1174[edit] ""“alight, winds approach deadly approaching winds alight. ”-the ketek, written by navani on lightday of jeseses 1174, on the cover of a volume of her journal"" on jeseses 1174, a few days after the battle of narak and the rediscovery of urithiru, navani began a new volume of her journal; she wrote a ketek on the cover describing the meeting of the everstorm with a highstorm. it was written as a glyphpair in the shape of two storms crashing into one another. she discussed her grief regarding jasnah's apparent death and the fact that sadeas's treachery distracted her from the danger of the singers. her descriptions of this time period were notable enough that nazh somehow sought out and read her journal. discovery of anti-voidlight, 1175[edit] during raboniel's occupation of urithiru, navani once again sought clues in her journals as part of her advanced research of lights. navani was one of the few people who had seen and described the unusual sphere that gavilar gave to szeth. raboniel allowed her to access the journals, although the fused also read them herself in order to better understand navani. when navani read the journals, she recalled gavilar insulting her by telling her ""you study light, but you are its opposite. a thing that destroys light"". this helped lead navani to an epiphany that gavilar had somehow procured anti-voidlight. excerpts[edit] c. ishab 1167[edit] ""he had spheres on the table. some twenty or thirty of them. he'd been showing them to his uncommon visitors-most of whom have vanished, never to be seen again. there was something off about those spheres. my eyes were drawn to several distinctive ones: spheres that glowed with a distinctly alien light, almost negative. both violet and black, somehow shining, yet feeling like they should extinguish illumination instead of promote it. [. . .] you aren’t worthy. that’s why. you claim to be a scholar, but where are your discoveries? you study light, but you are its opposite. a thing that destroys light. you spend your time wallowing in the muck of the kitchens and obsessing about whether or not some lighteyes recognizes the correct lines on a map."" jeseses 1174[edit] ""to be perfectly frank, what has happened these last two months is upon my head. the death, destruction, loss, and pain are my burden. i should have seen it coming. and i should have stopped it. our first clue was the parshendi. even weeks before they abandoned their pursuit of the gemhearts, their pattern of fighting changed. they lingered on the plateaus after battles, as if waiting for something. soldiers reported being watched from afar by an unnerving number of parshendi scouts. then we noticed a new pattern of their penetrating close to the camps in the night and then quickly retreating. i can only surmise that our enemies were even then preparing their stratagem to end this war. the next clue came on the walls. i did not ignore this sign, but neither did i grasp its full implications. the sign on the wall proposed a greater danger, even, than its deadline. to foresee the future is of the voidbringers."" jesesan 1174[edit] ""we had never considered that there might be parshendi spies hiding among our slaves. this is something else i should have seen."" jesesach 1174[edit] ""i was unprepared for the grief my loss brought-like an unexpected rain-breaking from a clear sky and crashing down upon me. gavilar's death years ago was overwhelming, but this... this nearly crushed me. i seek not to use my grief as an excuse, but it is an explanation. people act strangely soon after encountering an unexpected loss. though jasnah had been away for some time, her loss was unexpected. i, like many, assumed her to be immortal. i wish to think that had i not been under sorrow's thumb, i would have seen earlier the approaching dangers. yet in all honesty, i'm not certain anything could have been done. but, understandably, we were focused on sadeas. his betrayal was still fresh, and i saw its signs each day as i passed empty barracks and grieving widows. we knew that sadeas would not simply rest upon his slaughters in pride. more was coming. unfortunately, we fixated upon sadeas's plotting so much that we did not take note of the changed pattern of our enemies, the murderers of my husband, the true danger. i would like to know what wind brought about their sudden inexplicable transformation."" trivia[edit] - excerpts from the journal were used as epigraphs to the first part of - . - the ketek on the cover of the journal seen by nazh forms the part titles for - . notes[edit]"
Wandersail (1174 ship),https://coppermind.net/wiki/Wandersail_(1174_ship),"the wandersail is a large, three-masted frigate on roshar. its namesake is the mythical ship captained by derethil in the legend of the wandersail. ship[edit] the ship itself is built for speed from light (but strong) soulcast wood, and supposedly among the best in the fleet. various fabrial technological additions work to increase the ship's stability, fabrial pumps are used to keep the ship bailed no matter how much water washes onto the deck, and attractor fabrials within the hull shift weights around to keep the ship from capsizing. offensively, the ship has ballistae with attached firepods, and the ability to quickly drop sails and maneuver via oars if attacked. crew[edit] the ship is primarily owned by rysn, shown by a writ of ownership and a captain's cord, but partially owned by vstim and other investors. the captain is drlwan, whose brother kstled is the man-at-arms; both positions are traditionally female. the crew, though not rysn, are superstitious and believe in the passions to some extent. in order to maintain crew numbers, some members are held underdeck during storms in expectation of having to replace some losses. history[edit] vstim had the wandersail built in the shipyards of klna city, which sheltered the ship from the everstorm. it was engineered with high-tech fabrials which provide greater stability during storms. during the true desolation, vstim gave his fleet of merchant ships to queen fen for the defense of thaylenah from an imminent invasion, however he reserved the wandersail. on the day of the battle of thaylen field, vstim offered the deed of the ship to his former pupil rysn, along with a captain's cord and a promise to finance her first expedition. rysn initially turned the gift down, however, she reconsidered after surviving the attack on the thaylen gemstone reserve. within a few months after the attack, rysn took the wandersail on an expedition to akinah in order to investigate the loss of the crewmembers of first dreams and locate the oathgate. following this, some of the sleepless maintain watch on rysn, and by extension, the ship. trivia[edit] - currently has no ship's pet, as the previous one was killed by the - , chiri-chiri, in following rysn, may now fill this niche. notes[edit]"
Kholinar Palace,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kholinar_Palace,"kholinar palace is the seat of house kholin, kholin princedom and the nation of alethkar. layout[edit] the palace is located in the northern portion of the city of kholinar, atop a large plateau. the main building of the palace stands between the monastery dais and the sunmaker park. the main entrance leads to twin ballrooms - presumably, a separate one for men and for women. both ballrooms have access to the garden that forms the northern side of the palace. directly adjacent to the grand entry are the palace garrison and the guest quarters. from the latter, one may reach the eastern gallery and through it, the sunwalk, which leads to the monastery dais. the lower floors of the palace have broad and wide corridors. the palace basements house the unloading docks, used to transport cargo to and from the palace plateau. the upper floors are narrow and cavernous. the royal quarters are located there. monastery dais[edit] the monastery dais is a large, almost perfectly circular platform near the main building, and may be technically considered part of the palace complex. as its name indicates, it houses the kholinar ardentia. notable features include the king's chapel and a room, the circle of memories, with eleven lanterns. the ardents believe that the lanterns represent the silver kingdoms, with the last one marking the tranquiline halls. in actuality, the room is the kholinar oathgate chamber, and the entire dais is the oathgate platform. people's hall[edit] the people's hall is a separate building within the palace complex. it's a large, open-air structure sitting in the shadow of the palace. in contrast to other parts of the complex, it is open to the public, as it is from there that the reigning monarch can address the common people of the city. it also holds a dais with the common throne, where the king or queen sits while making pronouncements. it is there that pai chooses to write her denouncement of aesudan kholin. beggars' porch[edit] the beggars' porch is a small patio in the back of the palace gardens, so named because the city's homeless often come there, hoping for some charity from the royal family. during the time between evi and gavilar's deaths, dalinar kholin would visit it often to get alcohol from the beggars, as his family would hide it from him. it was also there that the herald jezrien could be found, under the nickname ahu. whether the porch still remains in this capacity after gavilar's death is unclear. the catacombs[edit] the catacombs are located in the depths of the palace. they can be reached through the eastern wing, by the same passage that leads into the kitchens and the beggars' porch. it's a stone structure composed of long corridors, with a central chamber spacious enough to hold several dozen people, lit with real fires rather than spherelight. funerals for the lighteyes of house kholin take place there, and their bodies, soulcast to stone, are placed upright along the walls of both the main chamber and the tunnels surrounding it. palace guard and queen's guard[edit] the kholinar palace has two forces tasked with protecting it: the palace guard and the queen's guard. the palace guard is responsible for protecting both the palace and the city of kholinar, while the queen's guard is responsible for protecting the queen and the royal heir, who in the current times are aesudan and gavinor kholin. due to the actions of queen aesudan, the queen's guard has been corrupted either during the siege of kholinar or shortly before that by the forces of odium. aesudan refers to them as her ""knights radiant"". history[edit] it is unclear when the palace was built. prior to the gavilar kholin's war of alethi unification, it was held by a different branch of his family. after he and his brother dalinar conquered it, it became their seat of power. after gavilar's crowning, the palace became the seat of the government of united alethkar. king gavilar was murdered in the palace by szeth during a peace celebration with the listeners. following that, his descendant, king elhokar, moved to the pinnacle on the shattered plains, so as to be closer to the fighting there. queen aesudan - and, later, prince gavinor - remained at the palace, along with the widowed queen navani kholin, as aesudan was managing the kingdom in her husband's absence. at some point after navani left for the shattered plains, the palace came under the influence of the unmade ashertmarn. this caused the queen to begin acting increasingly erratically, throwing food away to rot, hosting excessively lavish parties and losing interest in ruling alethkar. the situation came to a peak when ardent pai was executed for publicly denouncing this new lifestyle, causing wide-spread riots in the city. after the riots, the queen recalled her guard into the palace, and appears to have fallen fully under the influence of both ashertmarn and yelig-nar. anyone to enter the palace would never return, either killed by the queen's guard or subsumed by ashertmarn, while the spren of the oathgate beneath the monastery dais were subverted by sja-anat. during that period, the cult of moments held feasts in the monastery dais. a portion of the palace guard resisted the lure of the unmade and were locked in a room. after their release, they claimed that time seemed to pass differently for them, feeling it has only been a few days, not a few weeks, since the riots. the strike team led by elhokar kholin tried and failed to re-take the palace from the queen. after the king's death and kholinar's fall, the fused appear to have made the palace the centre of their operations in the city, and began to dig it out from under the rubble in search of the cryptic that was supposed to bond elhokar. its further fate is unknown so far. notes[edit]"
Kholinar Wall Guard,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kholinar_Wall_Guard,"""“ this wall guard, this is redemption. if you fight here, nobody will care what you did before. because they know if we fall, this city and this nation will be no more. ”- azure"" the kholinar wall guard is one of three military forces stationed in the alethi capital of kholinar, alongside the queen's guard and palace guard. they are responsible for patrolling the city wall and standing watch over its gates. it is composed entirely of lighteyes of lower dahn, organized into four battalions, and commanded by a highmarshal. history[edit] some members of the wall guard were present when taln arrived at kholinar to bring news of the true desolation. at the start of the siege of kholinar, the guard's commander died when trying to quell the riots, while their highborn patron went to speak with queen aesudan in the kholinar palace, never to be seen again. when the cult of moments attempted to storm one of the gates, azure stepped up and took charge. afterwards, she became the wall guard's new highmarshal, although her men pretended that she was a man to circumvent their vorin sensibilities. azure rallied the wall guard and led them to seize the city's emerald reserves, as well as to attack one of the city's monasteries to acquire a soulcaster. she cut out a chamber underneath the city and lined it with aluminum to prevent the voidspren from detecting the work done there, then placed ithi and her sister there to soulcast rock into grain. by the time kaladin and his team arrived in kholinar, the sisters were kholinar's only remaining food source. at that time, the wall guard was actively recruiting any lighteyes who could wield a weapon, regardless of whether they were deserters, or even criminals, using free meals as an incentive to join. when they attempted to recruit kaladin, he agreed, hoping to learn where the city's food was coming from. he eventually revealed himself to them as a shardbearer and informed them about king elhokar's presence in the city, then rallied them to join his group in an assault on the kholinar palace. during the fighting, the wall guard suffered tremendous losses, especially when they began to clash with the singers as they assaulted the city. after their attack failed, azure was dumped into shadesmar along with kaladin, shallan and adolin, while the surviving guard members were captured and imprisoned by the fused. members[edit] notes[edit]"

Rodge McCaffrey,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rodge,"rodge mccaffrey (rig, callsign: rigmarole) is a childhood friend of spensa who is accepted into ddf flight school with her. he drops out after their first battle, pursuing the engineering corps and getting a job there. appearance and personality[edit] rig is described as lanky and has red hair. his eyes are a clear, deep blue. he is often self-conscious, but through the designs he receives so much praise for at the engineering corps, he becomes much more confident. rig is very smart, and is good with machinery. history[edit] flight school[edit] rig has known spensa for a very long time. they studied for their flight school entrance exam together and rig received a perfect score. he trains with spensa at the flight school, but their flight is called into battle after only a short amount of training. in the course of the battle his ship gets struck by a krell destructor blast, though his shield holds and he makes it out of the battle unscathed. the next day he drops out of the program, realizing that it has only ever been spensa's dream. repairing m-bot[edit] rig received multiple offers for jobs after dropping out, then spensa showed him m-bot, a crashed, high-tech fighter which she found in a cave. rig was very excited, wanting to help repair it. because of this, he decides to accept a job with the engineering corps to acquire the parts and knowledge he will need to fix m-bot. as he learned more and more during his training as an engineer, he was able to help repair m-bot bit by bit. he managed to get most of the necessary supplies through his job with the engineering corps, though lacked a few items, mainly a booster. rodge wanted to share the designs some of m-bot’s features, though many of his features were too complicated for him to understand and explain. some of the features he managed to explain to his superiors, which quickly granted him favor and respect there. when spensa managed to get a booster from the wreckage of hurl’s ship, which allowed rodge to finish repairing m-bot. experiments with the taynix[edit] along with jorgen and fm, rig is assigned to help with the investigation of how to use the taynix as hyperdrives, after jorgen finds a colony of them in the caverns of detritus. he worked on the more technical side of the experiments, and created a metal box made of the same material as the one that they found inside m-bot. later rig was working in the platform prime control room, trying to find where the ftl communicator is located. he subtly tried to get her to leave, and fm asked him what he had against her. rig admitted that he liked her, and they awkwardly changed the subject. they found the ftl communicator, a metal box like the one in m-bot’s ship, and they realized that if they put a taynix in it, they could use it for hyperspeed communication. rig heped devise an experiment for jorgen, and he tries to teleport using a slug in the metal box. jorgen tried to teleport using a ship, and rig monitored the experiment from platform prime. when the superiority was alerted to jorgen’s cytonic abilities and they moved into position for bombardment, and jorgen told rig that he’d be in a fighter with fm. he told rig that they’d be attacking the planetary cannon, and would need someone with mechanical knowledge to know how to best destroy it once she got up there. he was reluctant to go back into combat again, but skyward flight was glad to have him back even for a short time. he and fm flew up to the battle, listening to fm’s music as they went. after jorgen teleported their ship up close to the superiority main battleship, rig analyzed the cannon and decided it was heavily protected. he told fm to target the controls, which were less shielded. they were soon swarmed by krell however and forced to retreat. cobb called the retreat as the cannon began firing at detritus, but the engineering corps managed to get the planetary shield up to block the shots. skyward flight regrouped a ways away while command figured out a plan, and gave the taynix time to recover. rig and fm cuddled with the slugs in fm’s ship while listening to music. they held hands, enjoying each other’s company and talking, and fm told rig that she is interested in him. once the slugs had relaxed, skyward flight and a few other ships touched wings, and jorgen teleported them inside the shield. after they landed on platform prime, rig went to meet with the engineering corps and afterward informed fm that they were going to try using fine to make the ftl communicator work. as they walked to the command room, rig and fm discussed what they feared most, and fm admitted that she’s afraid of dying in battle and ceasing to exist. they discussed their days in flight school as well as the taynix, and the topic turned to their experiments. rig proposed that they try different experiments, and him and fm kissed briefly. fm and rig worked on an experiment in the engineering bay, trying to teach the taynix to teleport to a familiar place. they showed chubs some caviar in a box, calling it “home”. fm put chubs in a separate box and told him to go to “home”. though he doesn’t initially, he eventually teleports into the box. they tried the same experiment with two more slugs, with varying results. they headed to the command room on platform prime, where fine had been loaded into the communicator. cobb called cuna, who responded. rig listened as cuna requested help, saying that they’re being besieged by twenty krell fighters at the station of sunreach. cobb ordered skyward flight to depart immediately, and rig said goodbye to fm as she left, fearing for her safety. after skyward flight returned with cuna and their staff, rig had a joyful reunion with fm. they talked a bit, then kissed. alanik’s return[edit] ""“are you coming with us? becuase if not, you should get back to engineering. you don’t want to be associated with what we’re about to do. ”-fm to rig before leaving"" when alanik came to detritus and requested aid, rig and other members of skyward flight came to chat with her while she awaited a decision. they chatted amiably, and cobb came in and told them that alanik’s request had been officially denied. he said his hands were tied, but heavily hinted that he wanted skyward flight to leave anyway. rig decided not to leave with skyward flight, reluctantly staying behind. helping alanik[edit] on redawn[edit] ""“i’ll help you. but you should know, there’s a lot going on here too. cobb and jeshua met with some representatives from the superiority. ”-rig to fm"" fm and alanik hyperjumped to deteritus to recruit rig, since they needed his help overeating wandering leaf and fixing alanik’s ship. he agreed to help, and filled them in on the national assembly’s dealings with the superiority. once on wandering leaf, rig examined the platform’s systems, findings a hyperdrive mechanism, a weapons system, and a shield system. ""“interesting. maybe it requires a hyperdrive to move? get me someting to stand on so i can get a look above the boxes and see how they’re interfaced with the platform.”-rig analyzing wandering leaf’s systems"" he helped jorgen figure out how to work the platform’s cytonic inhibitor, and spent the next few days hard at work, not getting much sleep. he repaired alanik’s ship, activated the platform’s shield, and helped figure out how to use boomslug in the weapons system. after the others came up with a plan, he used drape to hyperjump the platform outside the tree city of tower. while alanik and arturo went to rescue rinakin and skyward flight fought off unity ships, rig stayed on wandering leaf with jorgen and operated the platform. when a superiority battleship arrived to attack tower, rig hyperjumped wandering leaf up close to it, allowing the automatic turrets and mindblade weapons system to destroy it. a cytonic varvax soldier hyperjumped onto wandering leaf to try and seize the command room, and rig called for boomslug to help him. boomslug attacked the varvax, destroying its armor and causing it to flee. the unity forces retreated, and the independence faction and skyward flgiht won the battle. cobb called them, and told them to return to detritus with some of the urdail officials. rig and the others thought cobb was acting strangely, and determined that the man is actually an imposter posing as cobb, using holographic technology stolen from m-bot. they ended the conversation, and rig hyperjumped wandering leaf to a point outside detritus. back to detritus[edit] ""“the box is rigged to prevent tampering. i don’t know how it works, but i know that much. alanik, i’m sorry. i can’t fix it. we need to get off this ship immediately. ”-rig to alanik"" back outside detritus, alanik and jorgen went aboard a superiority ship to rescue gran-gran, cobb, jorgen’s parents, and members of the national assembly. alanik discovered a bomb on board, rigged to blow, and fetched rig from wandering leaf. rig examined the bomb, but didn’t know anything about how to stop it. he used drape to hyperjump back to wandering leaf while alanik and jorgen tried to get the others off the ship. they got gran-gran and cobb off, but the others died in the resulting explosion. afterward, rig partially blamed himself for their deaths, but alanik told him it wasn’t his fault. rig joined jorgen and the rest of the flight as jorgen yelled at vice admiral stoff, and went with fm to try and get one of the slugs to find cobb. when the rest of skyward flight left for evershore, rig worked on exploring detritus’ platforms with the engineering team. fm and jorgen returned to detritus during the battle for evershore, and met with rig. after being appraised of the situation, rig went with them to wake up stoff and give him a report. stoff gave them almost full autonomy, dumping the responsibility, and therefore possible blame for failure, on them. jorgen ordered rig to try and access the platform control center, to try and send some platforms to evershore to help. ""“um, i know i asked you for more slugs, but i really don’t know which boxes to put them in. i have no idea what some of these slugs would do, even if we could figure out where to put them.”-rig to jorgen"" some time later, jorgen hyperjumped to rig again, saying they needed to transport several platforms to evershore as soon as possible, since superiority reinforcements were arriving. rig showed jorgen that there were tons of empty taynix boxes in the control room, but that he didn’t know what many of them did, much less have enough slugs to power them all. jorgen and fine connected with the taynix beneath detritus, summoning hundreds of various slugs into the control room, startling rig. rig and several of the slugs started getting the new slugs into boxes, though rig still didn’t really know what he was doing. jorgen told him to just do his best to figure it out. when the superiority forces started targeting various evershore cities, rig was forced to hurry up. jorgen, with the help of fine, managed to hyperjump the entire planet of detritus to a point off evershore. rig found that the control platform had similar navigation controls to platform prime, which could direct the hyperslugs. detritus’ sudden appearance caused a massive tidal wave to form down below, and he and his engineers scrambled to enter coordinates into the navigation system. he moved detritus further away from evershore, while also sending out various platforms down to evershore to protect the kitsen cities from superiority ships. after the superiority retreated and evershore was saved, rig worked on optimally placing platforms around the planet to generate the shield. relationships[edit] spensa[edit] ""“we grew up together. she’s like my sister. not that i ever had a sister, but if i had one who was, like, terrifying, that’s how i think it would feel. ”-rodge to fm about spensa"" rodge and spensa have been friends since they were about eight, as they were both social outcasts. spensa's enthusiasm often catches rodge up and he is dragged along on many of her reckless adventures. rodge is resigned to this, though, and isn't surprised when spensa turns up late at night hanging upside-down at his window. when someone was trying to steal rodge's lunch when they were younger, she gave the offender a broken arm and black eye. when rodge realizes that flight school is not for him, spensa is upset, but comes to realize he will be happier elsewhere. rodge is worried about spensa when she infiltrates the superiority and gets trapped in the nowhere, but has confidence that she will make it out. fm[edit] ""“you will not tell her i said those things. she probably doesn’t even remember who i am....does she? ”-rodge talking to spensa after admitting he likes fm"" rodge has a crush on fm and thinks she is smart, cute, and has nice eyes. spensa, while playing matchmaker, asks fm about her dating preferences to see whether she would be interested in someone like rodge, although her attempts to find out information do not go very far. fm thinks rodge is cute, and wanted to get to know him better. because of his shyness, though, rodge felt very awkward around her and she thought he didn't like her, as he never looked her in the eye and rarely spoke to her. after she confronts him, asking what his problem is, he confesses that he has a crush on her, and apologizes for making her feel that he didn't like her. fm, though she finds rodge attractive, is worried about getting into a relationship because of the danger of her life as a pilot, knowing that any day, she could fly away and not come back. she tells rodge she doesn't know if she likes anyone, and he takes it as a gentle letdown. after this, rodge is able to talk to fm more and treats her more normally, and makes her heart skip when he smiles at her. when the superiority prepares to fire on detrius with planetary weapons, fm and rodge ride together in the dulo. when the planetary shield goes up, they, the rest of skyward flight, and a couple of other pilots are trapped outside until they rendezvous to hyperjump back inside. during the wait, fm tells rodge that she's more sure about her feelings now, and takes his hand, much to his delight. after the battle, fm is stressed and worrying about the taynix. rodge talks to her, and helps her feel better. she kisses him after he helps her up. they work together to experiment with the taynix, and rodge agrees with fm in that the slugs are alive and more than just tools. rodge is worried when fm leaves on missions, and fm is worried about hurting him if she doesn't come back, but she decides that there's little point in staying alive if one doesn't have much to live for. with this thought, she decides to continue her relationship with rodge despite the danger of her situation. fm and rodge used their taynix to meet quietly, because they weren't ready to tell everyone that they were dating yet. they are close, and fm enjoys helping rodge with his engineering projects, or at least watching him work. trivia[edit] - rodge’s last name is a nod to - , the writer of notes[edit]"

Evi Kholin,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Evi,"""“enjoy the moment. close your eyes and contemplate what the one has given you. seek the peace of oblivion, and bask in the joy of your own sensation. ”-evi"" evi kholin is dalinar kholin's first wife, and the mother of adolin and renarin. appearance and personality[edit] ""“must everything be fighting to you? ”-evi"" evi is exceptionally tall, almost as tall as an alethi. she is willowy and somewhat frail, with a small chest. her hair is pale blonde and her skin is light golden, though neither are true iriali gold, and she has matching light yellow eyes. evi is a calm woman, often shying away from conflict. she is a dedicated pacifist and often tries to convince her husband to behave more peacefully and reject the warlike ways of his kinsmen. she enjoys the moments of calm between the two of them, and could be truly happy then. though peaceful, evi is dedicated to her convictions. even shortly before the end of her life, she tries to convince dalinar that violence doesn't always need to be the answer. evi's time among the alethi has caused her to be jaded and critical. the contest of wittiness between the women makes her feel stupid; she critiques the alethi's supposed piety, noting that they are only ever devout when it suits their desire to wage war. she tries to assimilate into the vorin culture with mixed results, but does not let herself forget her origin. after her death, navani would claim that everyone loved her, but evi's own experiences run contrary to that observation. although she and dalinar are poorly matched, she nonetheless strives to make their relationship work. she refuses to let her frustration with dalinar's darker nature show to her children, having told them that their father is an excellent man and officer. eventually, she comes to truly care for him, although she is keenly aware that he does not reciprocate her feelings to the same extent. adolin likely inherited his emotional sensibility from her. she is a devout follower of iri religion and believes in the one. though she absorbs many vorin customs upon her marriage, including the worship of the heralds, she continues to treat the one as the highest deity. she also respects the nightwatcher as an aspect of the one and believes he can be contacted through dealings with the nightwatcher. attributes and abilities[edit] evi is a fluent speaker of the alethi language, although she has a habit of literally translating her native idioms into alethi, sometimes resulting in a loss of their context. she may be naturally left-handed, and likely re-trained herself to use her right hand upon marrying dalinar. she has some measure of artistic skill, having created the sketches of adolin's shardplate for the royal record. said shardplate was originally hers; it is one of the reasons why dalinar marries her in the first place. the queen of iri claims that the set belongs to her, although her claim appears weak, as she and evi aren't related. history[edit] early life and marriage[edit] evi was born in rira sometime around the year 1124. she grew up there with her brother, toh. at some point, possibly at birth, she was given a set of shardplate, although she would never use it herself. when she was roughly nineteen years old, evi and toh fled rira to alethkar and pursued an alliance with the alethi, offering a set of shardplate in exchange for their protection from their own people. it was torol sadeas who suggested that dalinar marry evi; dalinar agreed, knowing that navani was now beyond his reach. the two were betrothed soon thereafter, but only formally married three years later, as evi's culture required prolonged courtship. however, she accompanied him to his military campaigns throughout her betrothal. even then, she would often plead with dalinar to be more peaceful. sons[edit] by the year 1150, evi and dalinar were no longer at war, but rather at their home in kholin lands. it was in 1150 that she gave birth to her first son, adolin. shortly thereafter, dalinar would depart for the border wars with herdaz and jah keved, leaving evi to raise the boy on her own for the next five years. dalinar would visit several times; it was after one of those visits that evi gave birth to another child. as dalinar didn't answer her letters asking for a name, she eventually called the boy renarin, composing his name in an attempt to mimic alethi patterns. her intent was for it to mean ""re, born unto nar"" (as in dalinar), although it came out as ""one who is born unto himself"". evi told renarin the myth of parasaphi and nadris when he was young. war and death[edit] ""“no one actually cares about religion here. oh, they make sure to point out how superior their beliefs are to mine. but who actually ever worries about the heralds, other than to swear by their names? you bring ardents to battle merely to soulcast rocks into grain. that way, you don't have to stop killing each other long enough to find something to eat. ”-evi's frustration with the alethi"" when adolin was five years old, evi decided to join dalinar on his campaigns. this was motivated by several factors, chief among them the fact that all other alethi wives joined their husbands on the campaign trail, and that dalinar spent too little time with his children. although he tried to convince her that the battlefield was no place for her, she insisted on staying. from then on out, she would spend half of every year with dalinar -- and, later, adolin -- in his war camps, and the other half in kholinar with renarin, who was too sickly to take on the road. her riran accent began to fade at the time, though she would sometimes switch back to her native language. although outwardly it appeared that she and dalinar were a loving couple, by 1163 the two of them were more at odds than ever. evi wanted the killing to end, and for the family to return to alethkar and rest; dalinar sought to continue making war. this culminated in a major fight between them, which ended with evi breaking into tears. in an attempt to console her, dalinar promised that after quelling the new rebellion in rathalas, they would return to kholinar for at least a year. moreover, to respect her wishes to be more peaceful, he initially tried bargaining with tanalan. unfortunately, this was not to be. tanalan betrayed dalinar, attempting to kill him after sending him out to investigate rumors of a highprince that had betrayed gavilar. when dalinar returned after digging himself out of a deep pile of rubble, evi was already beginning to mourn him and grew even more distressed when he began his plan to take revenge, leading to him ordering his men to escort her out of the command tent to somewhere safe. unbeknownst to him, she snuck out and went to the city to plead with tanalan for peace. the young highprince detained her in his former safehouse, now turned city prison. when dalinar set flame to the rift, evi died in the flames, with dalinar finding out far too late to even attempt saving her. legacy[edit] ""“evi… he had never deserved her. ”-dalinar"" evi's body was recovered from the ruins to be given a proper burial. dalinar created a story to mitigate everyone's conjectures, claiming that she was kidnapped by tanalan's men and that the rift was burned in retribution for this. the story would later change, with torol sadeas, who was fighting alongside dalinar at the time, taking the blame for burning the city. both dalinar and sadeas were publicly censured by king gavilar for the loss of rathalas. dalinar would later begin to hear the voices of all those he had killed, with evi being the loudest among them. this drove him to drink heavily, withdrawing from public life. eventually, he visited the nightwatcher, following evi's stories of her, and asked her for forgiveness for his part in evi's death. as the nightwatcher was incapable of understanding his request, cultivation intervened and took away all of dalinar's memories of his wife. from then on out, dalinar remembered nothing of evi, even her name -- whenever someone else said it, he heard only the rushing of the wind, and sometimes he had trouble remembering that he had ever been married in the first place. those memories began to return shortly after the beginning of the true desolation. eventually, dalinar remembered rathalas as well, sending him back into a brief stint of alcoholism as evi's voice returned to haunt him. odium tried to use this to tempt him into becoming his champion, although dalinar failed to give in. at that point, he heard a voice that might belong to evi, telling him that she forgave him. this was the final push he needed to open honor's perpendicularity during the battle of thaylen field. after these events, as dalinar had more and more time to recall his rediscovered memories of his late wife, he realized that he needed the memories and even felt that the memories were ""comfortable"" to him. he also wrote and eventually began releasing portions of oathbringer, my glory and my shame, including in it an open confession of what he had done; many people were terribly shocked to learn what he had done. adolin, in contrast, had warm memories of his mother. he got his ""western sensibilities"", including his penchant for snuggling and his greater than usual emotional intelligence, from her. he also kept a memento of her, her chain, which he considered to be his lucky charm, always making sure to keep it in his pocket for important duels. when he discovered the truth behind the burning of rathalas, adolin tried to rationalize his father's actions by attributing them to the influence of the thrill and to dalinar being a different man in general at that time. however, he nursed a deep-seated fury towards his father on his mother's behalf despite these attempts. trivia[edit] - in - , dalenar (proto- - ) likewise has a dead wife, though she is called kalkanah rather than evi. very little is known about her, only that she would be furious if dalenar were to dirty their house, and dalenar did not forget her, nor did her death crush him as badly as evi's crushed dalinar. - if she had joined the - , she would most likely be an - or a - . notes[edit]"

War of Reckoning,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Vengeance_Pact,"the war of reckoning was a conflict on roshar between alethkar and the listeners. this name for the conflict was used by brightness hashal in reference to the alethi's goal of delivering justice upon the listeners for their role in the assassination of the alethi king gavilar kholin. background[edit] while exploring a forest south of the shattered plains, king gavilar's brother dalinar kholin encountered a society of non-slaveform singers who called themselves listeners. not knowing what they are, and seeing their similarity to parshmen, gavilar's stormwardens coined the term parshendi, meaning roughly parshmen who can think. ""parshendi"" became the official alethi term for the listeners, and it also spread to other countries on roshar. the listeners did not show any offense for the term. diplomatic relations were established, and eventually a treaty was made between the alethi and the so-called parshendi. the king invited a parshendi delegation to celebrate the signing of the treaty in kholinar. that night, gavilar revealed to eshonai, a member of the delegation who could speak alethi, his secret intention to bring back the old singer gods in order to also bring about the return of the heralds. he mistakenly believed that the parshendi would welcome this idea. in reality, the ancestors of the listeners had abandoned their gods in favor of freedom, and they did not want their gods to return. after hearing the news from eshonai and fearing gavilar's plans, the council of five decided to have the alethi king assassinated that very night. they assigned this task to their newly-acquired slave, a shin truthless named szeth who possessed jezrien's honorblade. after an intense fight, the man who would later be called the assassin in white succeeded in killing gavilar. while the rest of the listeners fled from kholinar, three members of the council of five-gangnah, klade, and varnali-remained to take credit for the assassination. the alethi had the three hanged. during gavilar's funeral service, his son and successor king elhokar made the alethi highprinces vow to avenge his father's death. this vengeance pact between the highprinces and the new king became alethkar's declaration of war against the parshendi. participants[edit] alethkar[edit] each princedom in alethkar had its own army. there were ten highprinces, namely roion, sadeas, aladar, kholin, vamah, ruthar, thanadal, hatham, bethab, and sebarial. each committed part of their armies into fulfilling their vengeance pact with king elhokar, and had set up warcamps on the leeward side of the shattered plains. each highprince had his own warcamp built on one of ten crater-like rock formations that were once inhabited by the listeners. the majority of the alethi armies were composed of darkeyed spearmen organized into battalions and led by lighteyed officers. darkeyed soldiers were only allowed spears, so alethi archers and swordsmen were all lighteyes. aside from regular weapons, the alethi also had around twenty shardblades. it is uncertain exactly how many of these were used in the war and how many remained in alethkar, but there were more than thirty official shardbearers in the warcamps, a few of whom had both plate and blade. the alethi also had fabrials, some of which, like grandbows, had military applications. listeners[edit] unlike the alethi, the listeners had a single unified army. their society was governed by the council of five, whose members each represented one of the five singer forms that the listeners used. the council member who used warform, which is the singer form used by listener warriors, served as the general of the army. at some point during the war, eshonai became the warform member among the five and started leading the fight for survival against the alethi. she also possessed the listeners' only remaining set of shardblade and shardplate, and used these in addition to warform during battle. warform gave listener warriors a carapace armor as well as increased strength. though not as strong or resilient as someone with shardplate, warform listeners were a real threat to regular human soldiers. their strength allowed them to use heavy weapons like battleaxes, hammers, and sometimes clubs and swords. they were also capable of jumping far enough to cross chasms, something that only those with shardplate could do on the alethi side. while they also used archers just like the alethi, the listeners' combat strategy also involved using warpairs, or pairs of warriors who fought side by side as partners. these listener warpairs would jump around the battlefield in coordinated maneuvers and attack enemy troops with heavy weapons from multiple directions. when the war started, the listeners moved to the ruins of stormseat, located at the center of the shattered plains. they called this central place narak, which in their language meant exile. it served as the base of operations for their army as well as refuge for the rest of their people. history[edit] beginning of the siege[edit] in order to fulfill the vengeance pact as quickly as possible, the alethi highprinces initially planned a full-scale attack on the parshendi. however, they were unable to immediately locate the enemy's center of operation, and upon arriving at the shattered plains, the highprinces realized that a full-scale attack on the plateau in the center of the plains would present huge risks because of highstorms. the shattered plains cover an enormous area, and armies must cross chasms to get between plateaus, making a campaign to the center of the shattered planes vulnerable to a highstorm while exposed on the plateaus. therefore, the highprinces decided upon a siege strategy. as the shattered plains are only accessible from the leeward side, the plan assumed the parshendi would leave their camp from hunger and face the alethi. the impact of gemhearts[edit] once the alethi settled on the border of the shattered plains, they discovered that chasmfiends live in the chasms between plateaus. chasmfiends contain gemhearts which hold enormous amounts of stormlight for use in soulcasting. this enabled the armies to soulcast metal for weapons, wood for bridges, barracks of stone and food for troops. the safest way to win a gemheart of a chasmfiend would be to wait for a chasmfiend to climb on a plateau, where it would pupate. once this happens, the chrysalis could be opened with a shardblade or more slowly with hammers and chisels. both the alethi and the listeners used these gems to sustain their armies, prolonging the siege and greatly extending the duration of the war. whenever a chrysalis is spotted on a plateau, a race between the listeners and alethi highprinces would occur. whoever arrived first would have to retrieve the gemheart from the chrysalis before the opposing army arrives, otherwise a battle would occur. for five years, the war was fought mostly through these skirmishes over gemhearts. loss of unity between highprinces[edit] since every highprince worked on his own, depending on where the chasmfiend was pupating, several alethi armies could attempt to get to the chasmfiend first. whenever an army arrived and another alethi army was already there, the second army turned back home. this led to rivalry between the highprinces because success in gaining gemhearts meant wealth and appreciation from king elhokar. over the years the result was that the alethi army lost its original purpose-to fulfil the vengeance pact-and their unity. the ten armies fought on their own instead of fighting united against the parshendi. the battle of the tower[edit] the tower plateau is a very large plateau not far from the center of the shattered plains. because of this, the listeners always arrived first whenever a chasmfiend pupated on the tower plateau, and they usually had enough time to arrange themselves into battle formation and prepare their defense. consequently, no alethi army had ever won a battle at the tower during the first six years of the war. when dalinar worked together with sadeas, a chasmfiend was spotted on the tower. according to their plan, sadeas, whose armies were faster than dalinar's, had to clear a space on the tower for dalinar's troops, who were better trained, to engage the parshendi. this worked as planned until sadeas abandoned dalinar, leaving dalinar trapped. dalinar and the remnants of his army were saved by bridge four led by kaladin. in the aftermath, dalinar made his nephew, king elhokar, declare him highprince of war. it was dalinar's goal to re-focus the alethi armies into finally fulfilling the vengeance pact and to unite them again. stormform and the failed peace talks[edit] seeing the steady decline of her people and becoming war-weary, eshonai was eager to find a way out of the protracted war. she had been planning to approach dalinar kholin and sue for peace. however her sister, the scholar venli, did not believe such a plan would work. instead, venli argued that they should use a form of power in order to defeat the alethi. secretly guided by the voidspren ulim, venli had previously captured a stormspren, a spren that granted stormform. this form of power was believed to allow the summoning and control of storms. eshonai initially protested the idea due to the form's connection to their hated gods. however, after the other leaders sided with venli, eshonai ended up volunteering to experiment with stormform to see what it does. prior to bonding the stormspren, and with the help of dalinar's son adolin and the listener warrior thude, eshonai was finally able to arrange a meeting with dalinar to discuss a possible end to the war. the plan was for the meeting to happen in seven days. having received confirmation of the arrangement, eshonai went out to experiment with stormform. stormform gave eshonai a different kind of armor and the ability to jump chasms more easily. she started attuning to a new set of rhythms that were more aggressive. more importantly, the new form changed eshonai's personality, making her more arrogant and belligerent. she abandoned her plan to negotiate. instead, she challenged the alethi to try and destroy her people if they could. she planned to lure the whole alethi army out far away from their warcamps and destroy them with a summoned highstorm. along with venli, eshonai organized the adoption of stormform for all of their people. a few of the listeners did not agree to this plan and managed to escape. rlain, a listener spy who infiltrated the alethi army and joined bridge four, returned from his espionage mission and discovered the new stormform army. he decided not to join them. the battle of narak[edit] after negotiations with eshonai fell through, dalinar proposed a joint assault on the parshendi camp in order to end the war and fulfill the vengeance pact once and for all. out of all the alethi highprinces, only aladar, roion, and sebarial joined him in the end. they set out near the start of the weeping, expecting no highstorm to impede their attack. along the way they met up with rlain, who reported to dalinar what had happened to his people. upon the arrival of the alethi armies in narak, a large number of the stormform listeners initiated the ritual song to summon a storm, while the rest prepared to fight the invaders. the battle was fought on three plateaus. aladar, roion, adolin each led soldiers on their own designated plateau while dalinar gave orders from the command tent on another plateau. sebarial's army reinforced aladar's and roion's, as sebarial himself did not fight. the stormform listeners showed the ability to shoot red lightning, which they successfully weaponized against the alethi. roion's army was eventually defeated, but adolin and aladar managed well enough on their plateaus. having been warned by rlain that the stormforms' song will bring destruction, dalinar instructed adolin to stop the singers. adolin found a way to get to the singers and killed many of them, but eshonai attacked before he could finish the task. in the end, even though he defeated eshonai, he was unable to prevent the song from being completed. the summoned storm turned out to be the everstorm, and it came towards them from the west, bringing red lightning. in addition, the stormfather sent an unexpected highstorm, coming from the east as highstorms usually do. szeth arrived on the battlefield on a mission from taravangian to assassinate dalinar, but was thwarted by kaladin. shallan davar managed to find and activate the ancient oathgate within the city, and the surviving alethi army was safely transported to urithiru before the combined everstorm and highstorm destroyed the whole city of narak. the surviving remnants of the stormform army eventually ended up as vessels for the fused, the immortal commanders of odium's army that returned through the everstorm. the exception was venli, whom odium spared for his own purposes. the non stormform listeners who escaped into the chasms survived with the help of a chasmfiend. warfare[edit] having to battle on the shattered plains, with its unique chasm-filled terrain, brought some notable characteristics to the war. the use of bridges between plateaus[edit] while warform listeners were able to jump the distance between plateaus, an alethi army could only cross a chasm with a wooden bridge from an adjacent plateau. there was no way to climb a plateau from a chasm. permanent bridges could only be constructed next to the warcamps because any permanent bridges built further on the plains were destroyed by listener raids. during a race for a gemheart, mobile bridges were used by the alethi armies. there were two main types of bridges. sadeas pioneered the technique of using the light bridges, advantageous for their mobility, manned by bridgemen who were left exposed for the purpose of attracting enemy fire that would otherwise have centered on his soldiers. that is also why bridgemen were neither armored nor trained. when others of the highprinces saw sadeas' success, they began using his system as well. dalinar did not use those bridges because he was convinced that officers shouldn't demand anything from their soldiers that they would not do themselves and reproached sadeas for wasting lives. later, though, sadeas and dalinar worked together. sadeas, who could reach a plateau faster than anyone else with his light bridges, went ahead with most of his force and secured a foothold; dalinar followed at the pace of his chull-drawn bridges, although he could reach the contested plateau twice as quickly because he crossed on some mobile bridges sadeas had lent him so he didn't need to stop and lower his own bridges at each chasm. at the final plateau, dalinar would put his own bridges forward so as not to waste bridgemen's lives. kaladin was the first to train a bridgecrew of a light bridge and had considerable success with it. not only did he manage to make them faster than other crews, he also devised the method of ""side carrying"" the bridge so that it could shield arrows from bridgemen. although this method significantly protected the bridgemen, it was a strategical failure to sadeas' army. the parshendi archers realized bridge four were too well protected and focused their arrows on the bulk of soldiers instead, causing heavy loss of trained soldiers instead of expendable bridgemen. other bridgecrew who awkwardly tried to imitate them failed to deliver the bridges and this resulted in a lost battle. as punishments, lamaril was executed and kaladin was left out for the highstorm. the use of shardbearers[edit] when an army arrived at a plateau and the enemy army was already formed up for battle, the only way for the attackers often was to send in shardbearers who could jump over the chasm and clear a space for the bridges to land. also, shardblades were a very effective way to cut open the chrysalis in order to get the gemheart. apart from that, shardbearers had the same use as in every other battle during that time on roshar. chasm duty[edit] during battles on the plateaus, falling into chasms was a real risk for both alethi soldiers and listener warriors, and many died in this manner. the dead who were left after a battle were also blown into the chasms during highstorms. there, the dead were flooded to the leeward end of the chasms, where they stayed until another flood pulled them elsewhere. search teams consisting of soldiers or bridgemen were periodically sent down into the chasms to gather weapons, armor, spheres, or anything of value from the dead. chasm duty was dangerous because of the risk of another highstorm flooding the chasms and because of chasmfiends who could come upon a search team. notes[edit]"
Mistborn Prime,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Mistborn_Prime,"mistborn prime is the eleventh novel written by brandon sanderson. allomancy was originally a part of mistborn prime, although only mistborn were included. mistings, as a concept, were only created when allomancy was added to mistborn: the final empire. another element that was added was emotional allomancy, zinc and bronze. mistwraiths also originally appeared here, where they play a more prominent role. they are more of a threat than the scavengers they become in the published works, and the hero fights one. oreseur orginated here and was the only character from this novel to make the move into the final empire. the prologue to the book is available on brandon's website. notes[edit]"
Gold,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Bloodmaker,"gold is the internal temporal pulling metal. an allomancer burning gold is able to see who they could have been in the past, had they made different choices. feruchemists can use gold to store health. when used as a hemalurgic spike, gold steals hybrid feruchemical powers. the paired alloy of gold used in the metallic arts is electrum. allomantic use[edit] a gold misting is known as a augur. an augur burning gold is able to see a hallucination of who the user could have been, known as a ""gold shadow."" while active, an augur can see through both pairs of eyes and think both sets of thoughts. due to the emotional stress associated with seeing one's alternate past, gold is not a very useful metal. furthermore, touching the gold shadow while burning gold causes unpleasant side effects. each time an augur burns gold, they see a different image, as it changes depending on their current situation. a gold shadow will also change if a person is stamped with an essence mark. feruchemical use[edit] a gold ferring is known as a bloodmaker. gold is used to store health. a goldmind can be tapped to both heal at an accelerated rate or to heal from wounds that would normally be fatal. it is hard to fill a goldmind, due to the fact that it requires the bloodmaker to spend time sickly and weak. gold does not heal diseases as efficiently as it heals wounds. gold healing works by aligning an individual's physical aspect to their ideal self as recorded in their spiritual aspect. this does not prevent them from aging or certain genetic diseases as those are considered part of the ideal. aluminum in a wound will make it impossible for the bloodmaker to heal the injury around the metal for as long as it remains in the body. gold healing would interact with organ transplants in an interesting way. this can be either beneficial or detrimental depending on the circumstances. bloodmakers' bones are particularly interesting due to the time they spend weak and sick, which creates distinctive oddities in the joints and bones. damage to the soul, such as that caused by hemalurgy, can be healed by bloodmakers, though it would take a lot of health, i.e. compounding, to regain the stolen ability. a bloodmaker would also be able to heal a wound from a shardblade, or being withered by a shade. compounding[edit] a gold compounder would be able to use gold to have a nearly infinite supply of health. when compounding, a bloodmaker can heal very rapidly, and can survive flaying, decapitations, and point-blank explosions. the recovery from injuries and wounds is almost instantaneous. if a gold compounder draws health constantly, this can have several impacts. the compounder would be immune to most sicknesses and would not experience sore muscles, headaches, or feelings of tiredness. even when there is nothing for the gold to heal, the compounder can still feel a faint sense of extra energy from the health they are drawing. by drawing even more additional health, they can eliminate the need to breathe, as they are constantly healing the damage done to their cells from hypoxia. despite this, a gold compounder cannot stop their heartbeat or reverse the process of aging. constantly healing from wounds can also leave the compounder invulnerable to pain. savantism[edit] if someone were to compound gold enough to become a feruchemical savant with the metal, they would be able to survive even longer than a normal compounder of the metal. hemalurgic use[edit] when used as a hemalurgic spike, gold steals hybrid feruchemical powers (cadmium, bendalloy, gold, and electrum). history[edit] during the final empire, gold was classified as a higher metal along with atium. the majority of the nobility did not know that gold mistings existed and believed gold was only accessible to mistborn, due to gold's high value and the lord ruler's intentional misinformation that high metals do not have mistings. after the catacendre, it was realized that the ""high metal"" classification was wrong, and gold is actually a temporal metal. gold mistings, or augurs, had also come to be known by people. notes[edit]"
Ithi,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ithi,"ithi is a soulcaster in kholinar on roshar. she and her sister are tasked by azure with secretly feeding the kholinar wall guard by soulcasting stone into food. appearance and personality[edit] ithi is a middle-aged or elderly woman. as a result of being a soulcasting savant, she has vines seemingly growing underneath her skin, out of her eyes, and down her face. she wears a soulcasting fabrial on her hand that is powered by stormlight contained in large emeralds. like most alethi soulcasters, she is an ardent of the vorin church. abilities[edit] ithi is skilled in the use of her soulcaster fabrial. although she and her sister are not powerful enough to feed the entire city, they are able to keep the entire wall guard supplied with plenty of food, with ""some to spare"". she shares the fabrial with her sister and they are therefore able to keep soulcasting ""nonstop"". history[edit] during the siege of kholinar, highmarshal azure led the kholinar wall guard in defending the city against the voidbringers. food was very scarce in the city during the siege; the voidbringers intentionally allowed refugees from the surrounding areas to enter the city and drain its resources. under normal circumstances, the city's soulcasters would have been able to make soulcast food to sustain the populace for quite some time, but the invading army controlled voidspren known as ""screamers"" that could detect most uses of stormlight, including fabrials, and alert the fused. kaladin noticed that azure seemed to control an unusual amount of food, and even used it to recruit people into her army. azure eventually revealed a hidden series of chambers in the walls of the city. azure entered the tunnels every night to cut out blocks of stone with her shardblade that ithi and her sister would soulcast into food. they avoided detection by the screamers by lining the room with aluminum panels given to azure by hoid. notes[edit]"
Glyphs,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Glyphpair,"glyphs are a writing system used on roshar for basic communication, artistic expression, and religious practices. individual glyphs represent specific ideas. they are typically symmetrical and can be rendered with varying degrees of stylization. two glyphs may be combined into a glyphpair, forming a word distinct from the constituent glyphs. glyphs and glyphpairs are often designed as pictographs so that literacy is not required for comprehension. the writing system is not structured to facilitate the composition of sentences or more complex communication. history[edit] the usage of glyphs may predate even the heraldic epochs, as they can be found inscribed, along with other patterns, on the honorblades themselves. they came into common usage among humans during the era of solitude; and are said to have been given to the rosharans by the dawnsingers. glyphs seem to have a common origin with thaylen script, due to the presence of many similar graphemes. though women's script became the primary writing system used in vorin nations, glyphs are still used in many contexts. glyphs are inexplicably tied to the heralds and knights radiant. the ""ten fundamental glyphs"" are derived from or related to the ""swordglyphs"" of the honorblades and the knights radiant orders.. these specific glyphs also appear on some shardblades, like sunraiser. upon speaking new oaths or taking certain actions, similar glyphs may naturally appear around a knight radiant, formed out of frost or mist. when shardplate was worn by radiants before the recreance, it had glowing glyphs etched into the plate that trailed vapor with color corresponding to the radiant's order. these have since vanished for unknown reasons. some of these glyphs were known in the era of solitude, and others were not.[citation needed] usage[edit] glyphs are used for both basic communication and religious or artistic expression. due to vorin cultural prohibitions, men are not permitted to learn women's script and become fully literate. they are, however, permitted to use glyphs for the purpose of simple written communication. lighteyed men, and some high nahn darkeyed men, may learn to read and write glyphs as part of their education, enabling them to identify glyphs that aren't portrayed pictographically and to interpret glyphpairs more readily. despite this, men writing or drawing glyphs is still considered unmasculine or even blasphemous to some, especially among the lower classes. educated women also learn to read and write glyphs, with greater emphasis than men on calligraphic ability. this is particularly important as women are traditionally responsible for religious activities which involve writing glyphs. practical and economic uses[edit] shops often use glyphs and glyphpairs to indicate which type of goods are available for sale. for example, bookstores may display the glyphpair for ""book"", stylized into the shape of a book so that even illiterate servants will recognize it as a bookstore. signs may also be used to indicate specific items for sale as well as associated prices. books, folios, and scrolls intended for men may use glyphs and glyphpairs, along with images. textbooks use glyphpairs to designate body parts in anatomical diagrams while a guide on shardblade stances may use glyphs to indicate specific movements. these will often be accompanied with women's script for further clarification. while official documents may make use of glyphs, they are typically written with women's script. highborn lighteyed families often have a distinct glyph and a glyphpair. for example, the kholin family uses the ""khokh linil"" glyphpair; stylized as a tower and a crown, this crest appears on the armor, clothing, and banners of dalinar's army and servants. maps of the shattered plains use these glyphs and glyphpairs to indicate ownership of camps and plateaus. slaves are branded on the forehead with a glyphpair of the district in which they were enslaved, to signify their new caste. the addition of a ""shash"" glyph brand, marking a dangerous slave, can make it difficult to get a good price for the slave. upon earning their freedom, slaves may opt to cover these brands with a tattoo, including glyphs that reference the record of their release. art and religion[edit] glyphs are also pervasive in decorations and religious practices, where they tend to be portrayed in a very stylized manner. greater value is placed on beauty and aesthetics than on making the symbol easily recognizable. glyphs are occasionally used on clothing for decorative purposes. for example, alethi women sometimes wear dresses patterned with glyphs. the doors into the palanaeum are adorned with a beautiful carving of intricate glyphs. when the freed members of bridge four chose tattoos to cover their slave brands, they opted for a purely decorative ""bridge four"" glyphpair to be added. even the parshendi have been known to occasionally carve strange, unfamiliar glyphs into their daggers. sometimes these decorative glyphs may also take on a religious nature. in vorinism, glyphs are often sewn into fabric or painted with a flammable ink. these ""glyphwards"" are then burned as a prayer. young women may wear a ""bride's prayer"" on their sleeves prior to engagement, and soldiers may wear glyphwards into battle for luck and safety. some even tattoo themselves with glyphs intended as a prayer. women are typically responsible for drawing glyphwards for their families, though they may also be purchased at luckmerches and apothecaries. while the practice of glyphwards is common in vorin nations, some consider the practice to be superstitious. more pagan beliefs also surround the use of glyphs. for example, some believe that extrapolations of the ""tenth glyphic paradigm"" can be used to determine one's personality. stormwarden script[edit] stormwardens must perform calculations and a great deal of research to determine the coming of future highstorms. as men are permitted to become stormwardens, their books and notes are written with glyphs. while this extensive writing and prediction is generally considered taboo in vorin nations, the skill is too valuable for the practice to be forbidden. few are aware of how this system of writing works because of the secretive nature of the stormwardens and the surrounding controversy. when no suitable glyphs exist to convey a certain word, stormwarden script combines the pronunciation of multiple glyphs to phonetically reproduce the desired word. this phonetic usage is indicated by underlining the component glyphs. appearance and design[edit] glyphs can be seen written in three different ways: a standard, block form that highly resembles thaylen script; a calligraphic form, in which the glyph may be altered significantly for heightened aesthetics; or a radial form, where the glyph is drawn repeatedly with radial symmetry about some point. they typically have bilateral symmetry, matching the symmetrical pronunciation of the sounds they represent. in some cases, glyphs are composed of distinct graphemes representing consonants.. there are two styles of graphemes: standard and calligraphic. the standard set of graphemes are illustrated in a letter from nazh concerning his investigation of the calligraphers guild. while these graphemes are used in the design of new glyphs, many liberties may be taken in how they are utilized. as glyphs evolve in usage over time, these graphemes are often distorted, combined, or lost such that they are no longer identifiable. the graphemes often bear resemblance to the characters of thaylen script. when garphemes are apparent, they appear to be pronounced outward and down from the center and top of the glyph. the component graphemes are not always readily discernible. glyphs are often drawn in complicated ways that make it difficult to identify what they are unless a person knows what they are looking for. lines are often added, removed, or contorted. in order to draw glyphs, one must have a deep understanding of how the glyph may be expressed without overly obscuring the meaning. additionally, glyphs are often drawn as pictographs--visually depicting the word it represents. this is done so those who cannot read glyphs may still understand what they mean. evolution[edit] a glyph's appearance and design can change over time. because glyphs are typically memorized rather than read, a particular glyph's original graphemic roots might even get lost as it evolves. for example, this is how the glyph for ""storm"" (zeras) developed throughout alethi history: glyphpairs[edit] it is slightly more common to find pairs of glyphs being displayed together than individual ones. such ""glyphpairs"" can symbolize a variety of entities and concepts. - - - glyphpair, in the shape of a tower and crown for most of house kholin, - but in the shape of a sword and crown for king - . - - - glyphpair, drawn in the shape of a - - slave brand, glyphpair of a highlord's district - - slave brand, possible glyphpair for amaram's district - - highprince - glyphpair, in the shape of a deep gold - on a black field. - - - glyphpair - tower & hammer - highprince - glyphpair numbers[edit] glyphs may also be used to represent numbers. a base ten number system with a semblance of positional notation is used. numerals are written with bilateral symmetry and may be stylized for artistic or aesthetic purposes. it is unclear whether these glyphs are used only in vorin nations or throughout roshar. the names used for the numbers does vary, even among the vorin nations. in vorin usage, the words for numbers one through ten are derived from the names of the ten heralds. each is also assigned a suffix, and the names of larger numbers are created by combining these suffixes. thus the number ""1173"" is ""jesesabach"", using jes (1), -es (1), -ab (7), -ach (3). place value is read from top to bottom. different glyphs are sometimes used to represent numbers depending on place value. for example, the symbol ""2"" in the number ""20"" is not the same symbol used in the number ""2"". in the example to the right using ""1173"", the light blue represents ""3"", the green represents ""70"", the red represents ""100"", and the dark blue represents ""1000"". note that the blue ""3"" and red ""1"" differ from their basic configuration. trivia[edit] - glyphs were inspired by arabic word art. notes[edit]"
Thaylen Gemstone Reserve,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Thaylen_Gemstone_Reserve,"the thaylen gemstone reserve is the national bank of thaylenah located in thaylen city just outside the ancient ward by the wall. the reserve acts as a protector of wealth so that gemstones do not need to be moved from one location to the next thus exposing them to the risk of theft. many of the gems never leave the vault and are left uncharged. management[edit] while the whole structure of the gemstone reserve is unknown, rysn is working there taking care of queen fen's personal finances, and that position comes with an office in the gemstone reserve. part of her duties involve keeping the queen's personal vault. vaults[edit] the reserve has several vaults each with greater and greater levels of security. the inner vaults contain many large gems that are never removed from within the vault. each of these gems have individual id numbers placed under them for identification purposes. inside of this vault is queen fen's personal vault. notable gemstones include the king's drop, a large ruby that has stayed infused with stormlight for centuries, as well as the benval diamond, once owned by vstim. battle of thaylen field[edit] before the battle began the reserve was attacked by a single fused using the surge of illumination. the fused having taken the form of one of the guards joined the inspection of the vaults and upon finding the king's drop attacked and attempted to steal the gem. after the failed theft odium sent a thunderclast into the city and it destroyed the gemstone reserve in an attempt to locate the king's drop, scattering the contents of the reserve across the city. notes[edit]"
Pinnacle,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Pinnacle,"""“the palace was both finer and more mundane than she might have expected. ”-shallan"" the pinnacle is king elhokar kholin's palace on the shattered plains. layout[edit] the pinnacle stands on a hill above all the other warcamps, about an hour's march from the kholin warcamp. it is surrounded by a sheer drop of approximately a hundred feet. one road leads to the main entrance, while a smaller side route goes down to the stables at the feet of the hill. likewise, the feasting basin sits beneath the palace, with a short climb between it and the pinnacle gates. the outer market is also located nearby. the palace is made of sculpted, soulcast stone. a broad gateway leads inside, though there is also a back entrance atop a flight of steps. within, the pinnacle has several floors containing vast, cavernous halls, and numerous rooms serving a variety of purposes. a large part of it is dug straight into the hill, with windows cut out facing leeward. there are shutters on the windows to keep them closed during bad weather, though they tend to rattle and leak. notable rooms[edit] history[edit] the palace was constructed by the royal soulcasters during the war of reckoning. elhokar eventually dubbed it the pinnacle, and the name stuck. during its existence, the place served as elhokar's home, as well as the place where strategy and planning meetings were conducted, making it effectively the centre of alethi government. in addition, the pinnacle saw several failed attempts to assassinate the king - once by the diagram, through a sliced railing in the royal quarters, once by the assassin in white, and once directly by moash and graves. following that last attempt, kaladin temporarily relocated elhokar to little herdaz. after the battle of narak, most alethi relocated to urithiru. as with the other structures on the shattered plains, the pinnacle was all but abandoned. notes[edit]"

Torio City,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Torio_City,"torio city is the capital of the kingdom of torio on komashi, in the era before the activation of the father machine. the queen of torio resides in the city. torio city is also the home of a renowned university (including the institute of mechanical solutions) which is known around the countryside of torio for the aid they offer to the villages. the city holds an annual festival called the festival of reveals, which is focused at the exhibition hall and courtyard in the center of the city. most structures within the city are made of stone and have red roofs. the city is also full of trees, fountains, and sculptures of dragons. after the father machine is activated and the people of torio were consumed, torio city fell into disrepair. the ruins the city are located in the vicinity of kilahito, to the west, and take up a round area of comparable size. the people of nagadan located plants in the ruins of torio city which were useful in creating new strains of crops that could grow on the planet following the loss of the shroud. notes[edit]"
Tanalan,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tanalan,"tanalan is the lord of rathalas (also known as the rift). he has violet eyes and a nasally accent that is typical for the region. tanalan holds an intense hatred for dalinar due to the death of his father. history[edit] childhood[edit] ""“you can't have my daddy. daddy said... we fight monsters. and with faith, we will win... ”-child tanalan"" at the age of seven tanalan witnessed his father die at the hands of dalinar kholin. at the arrival of gavilar kholin's and torol sadeas' armies, tanalan and his mother were sent to hide within a secret room, set within the rock and hidden behind a crem-covered door. after tanalan's father was gravely injured during battle with dalinar, his guards attempted to hide him within the same hidden chamber; however, they were pursued by the blackthorn. when dalinar arrived, he found tanalan's father dead and tanalan attempting to defend his parents using the shardblade oathbringer. despite orders to kill tanalan, dalinar allowed him and his mother to escape. return of the heir and rathalas rebellion[edit] nine years later, tanalan returned to rathalas to take his place as city lord and demanded the return of his father's shardblade. his return threw the region into chaos, though open rebellion did not occur for at least another year. gavilar responded not with force but with diplomacy, hoping to nip the issue in the bud with politics. during that time, tanalan gained support and began working in secret with at least one of the other highprinces. battle at the rift (1163)[edit] after failing to secure rathalas through political means, gavilar ordered dalinar and sadeas to return to the rift and confront tanalan directly to quell the rebellion. the kholin army arrived before that of sadeas, and shortly before dalinar's arrival on the battlefield, an armed convoy left the city heading southeast. presumed to be from a highprince turned traitor, the convoy was tailed but not initially pursued. dalinar, at his wife's request for mercy, met tanalan on the battlefield, offering him a final chance to submit to the king and save his city from destruction. tanalan seemingly accepted dalinar's offer, choosing to pretend he was working with dalinar and the king from the beginning in order to root out betrayal among the highprinces. he named sadeas as the traitor. however, when dalinar pursued the escaping caravan, he found he had been betrayed not by sadeas, but by tanalan, who had hoped to draw dalinar away from the city and assassinate him. consumed by rage and the thrill, dalinar returned to the camp to find the newly arrived sadeas preparing to blockade the city. tanalan sent an envoy to negotiate with the armies after evi kholin stole into the city to attempt to convince him to surrender. the messengers were killed before they arrived at the camp, and dalinar ordered the gates breached and the city burned to the ground. tanalan was pulled from the burning city by dalinar's men as he attempted to reach his trapped family, who shortly afterwards were killed when the palace collapsed. tanalan died by asphyxiation after telling dalinar that evi had been imprisoned in the hidden room that had housed him and his mother all those years ago; dalinar thus realized that she was dead by his own hand. notes[edit]"
Rathalas,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rathalas,"rathalas, also known as the rift, was a city in the northern part of the eastern crownlands near central alethkar. the city was burnt to the ground in 1163 and has not since been rebuilt. the people of rathalas are sometimes referred to as rifters and have a distinct nasally accent. rathalas was large enough to house tens of thousands of people. geography[edit] rathalas was a tiered city built on struts up the side of chasm walls. it could be accessed from both the plains above and the canyon mouth below the city. rathalas is on the eastern shore of the sea of spears, and is near the thanadal and kholin princedoms. it is situated close to the spren city of celebrant within the cognitive realm. somewhere to the south-east is the waystop vedelliar, however it is unknown whether this town is within the eastern crownlands or unclaimed hills. the city resided within a deep chasm that narrows at one end and opens onto the sea of spears at the other. the canyon that held the city is at least 150 feet deep and v shaped in nature. the area above the canyon is flat and rocky and the city was difficult to spot when approached from above. a wall enclosed the opening to the rift on all sides except the western. the riverbed near to the city does not retain water, only filling during storms. this is due to the rockbuds surrounding the riverbed consuming large quantities of water. the rockbuds grow to exceptional sizes with trunks growing as tall as a man's waist and vines as thick as a man's wrist. history[edit] unification of alethkar (1141)[edit] rathalas was besieged by gavilar kholin during his campaign to unite the princedoms of alethkar. during the attack, dalinar kholin sought out and killed brightlord tanalan, winning himself the shardblade oathbringer. although he had instructions to kill tanalan's heir, dalinar spared the boy's life and he and his mother fled. rebellion of rathalas (~1151-1163)[edit] years later, tanalan's son (with whom he shared a name), returned to rathalas and demanded the return of his father's blade. the reappearance of tanalan destabilized the area, leading to the threat of rebellion within the entire region of the eastern crownlands. gavilar attempted to quell the region through political means but was ultimately unsuccessful, due in part to support of the rebellion from at least one of the other highprinces. destruction of rathalas (1163)[edit] after twelve years of failed negotiations between gavilar and tanalan, dalinar and sadeas returned to the rift to end the rebellion. against his nature but at the behest of his wife, dalinar offered tanalan a final chance to submit to the king and save his city. tanalan seemingly accepted dalinar's truce, offering him information about the highprince who had supported the rebellion and naming sadeas as traitor. dalinar, believing that one of sadeas' shardbearers had recently left the city, followed in pursuit only to fall into a trap set by tanalan, who hoped to separate dalinar from the kholin army and kill him. dalinar returned to rathalas after the attempt on his life failed and ordered the city razed to the ground and its people slaughtered in order to set an example. during the battle, tanalan was killed by dalinar after he watched his family die. evi kholin was killed during the battle after secretly travelling to the city to plead with them to surrender. in order to hide the true nature of her death and as well to justify the destruction of the city, a narrative was constructed that claimed that evi's assassination prompted the ensuing slaughter. notable citizens[edit] - brightlord - (son) - brightlord - (father) notes[edit]"
Rira (country),https://coppermind.net/wiki/Riran,"rira is a kingdom in northwestern roshar, bordering iri and babatharnam. formerly a part of the silver kingdom of iri, the people of rira have a distinct appearance, with blond hair and light skin. their culture is also unique, and incorporates certain aspects of both iriali and vorin tradition. geography and ecology[edit] rira is located in northwest roshar, a warm area of the continent. rira primarily borders babatharnam to the south; it also has a very small border with the misted mountains. to the west, a large lake separates rira from iri, with land borders to the north and south of the lake. the northeastern portion of rira is mountainous and surrounded by the reshi sea. notable locations[edit] rira contains an area known as the ""sunken forests"". it also controls the island that contains the city of kurth. rianal, drehy's birthplace, is in the west; based on drehy's blond hair, it may be located in rira, but it does not appear on available maps. history[edit] in the silver kingdoms era, almost all of rira's territory was a part of iri. at some point, the riran people that occupied the eastern portion of iri formed their own nation. rira also took control of a small island near its coast that contained the city of kurth, previously held by the silver kingdom of rishir. iri continued to claim rira as a vassal state, but this claim was disputed, and rira was recognized as a sovereign kingdom by other nations. ""“soulcasters. we have not these things in rira or iri. fascinating, fascinating ... and so many shards here. perhaps half the world's wealth of blades and plates, all contained in vorin kingdoms. the heralds themselves favor you.”-toh"" by the end of the era of solitude, rira was not a military power and it did not possess soulcasters. it did have at least one set of shardplate, which belonged to a teenager named evi. evi and her brother toh ""stole"" the shardplate by taking it out of rira; they used the plate as a bargaining chip to gain asylum in alethkar and convince dalinar kholin to marry evi. the other rirans were enraged that the plate had been taken, and exiled toh and evi. toh was very worried about retribution; he and evi intentionally sought out the alethi seeking protection through their military might. during the true desolation, the riran government did not respond to dalinar's overtures to form an alliance to fight the voidbringers. the monarchy of iri claimed to speak for rira; they considered dalinar a thief due to the history of evi's shardplate, despite the fact that the iriali may not have had a valid claim to the plate. dalinar actually considered giving the iriali the plate, now worn by adolin, if it would bring them to his side, but the talks quickly broke off. as the war progressed, the iriali invaded rira and reclaimed its territory. rira was then incorporated into odium's stronghold in northwestern roshar, and their armies fought against dalinar's coalition. politics[edit] rira is referred to as a ""kingdom"", implying that it has a monarchy of some kind, but the structure of their government is not known. even though iri's claim on rira as a vassal state is disputed, iri is thought to have significant sway over rira, at least from a diplomatic standpoint. because rira and iri lack soulcasters and shards, they are not thought of as a threat in the east. rira becomes a strategically significant location during the true desolation because of the oathgate located in kurth. because rira is deep in the territory controlled by odium, dalinar's coalition has not made an attempt to capture kurth. culture[edit] peoples[edit] ""“[zu] had bronze skin that seemed metallic to adolin, and her hair wasn't like his own blond-it was too golden. though his mother had been from rira, near iri, the two peoples were distinct. ”-adolin's thoughts on zu's appearance"" riran people superficially share some physical traits with the iriali. they are tall, and have light skin and blond hair. however, rirans do not have the iriali trait of a metallic tinge to their skin and hair. rirans have a mixed ancestry and there are genetic differences between the two peoples. adolin and renarin, who are half riran, have different amounts of blond hair mixed in with the black hair from their alethi father. ialai sadeas claimed that rirans and iriali wear very little clothing, similar to the reshi, although she may have been exaggerating in order to tempt dalinar. evi does wear a ""filmy"" dress when she first meets the alethi, and is not used to covering her safehand. their attitude towards sex and affection is less conservative than the vorin nations of the east; some alethi blame adolin's flirtatious nature on his riran heritage. religion[edit] rira seems to be ideologically and religiously distinct from both the iriali and the vorin nations to the east. some rirans have a belief system that incorporates parts of each of these religions, while others feel that neither doctrine applies to their people. evi believes in the iri concept of the one but also seems to worship the heralds. however, she uses unique names for the heralds such as yaysi and kellai, and she does not pray to the almighty. she burns glyphwards, but she is careful to use fragrant paper that also serves as incense. she also refers to an unknown entity named shishi. rirans have superstitions surrounding bad memories being stored in their skin, requiring one to rub them off with a stone once a month. language[edit] ""“viim cachi eko! ”-evi kholin"" rira has its own language that is linguistically related to the iri and reshi languages. the ""re"" in renarin's name comes from the riran language, although it has no specific meaning. toh and evi speak alethi with a thick accent, lengthening their ""oh"" and ""ah"" sounds. riran idioms do not translate well into alethi. notes[edit]"
Lamaril,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lamaril,"brightlord lamaril was a captain in the sadeas army on the shattered plains on roshar. he oversaw torol sadeas's bridge crews. appearance and personality[edit] lamaril is a tall, slim lighteyes. although he is not a large man, his angular body implies that he is not weak. he wears a beard with a square cut. his clothing includes a forest-green cloak, one of the colors of house sadeas. he is a cruel person who casually threatens his inferiors and causes them to fear him. he has no regard for the lives of darkeyed soldiers. his primary concerns during his tenure as a captain appear to be enriching himself and staying in sadeas's good graces. sylphrena does not like him. attributes and abilities[edit] lamaril is a landless lighteyes of a very low dahn; he is referred to as a ""near-darkeyes"" by brightlady hashal. he acted as gaz's immediate superior and blackmailed gaz for an unknown reason. gaz paid lamaril as much as he could but was not able to satisfy his debt. history[edit] after kaladin's arrival at the shattered plains in 1173, he quickly noticed that lamaril did not pay much attention to the bridge crews. this allowed bridge four to rescue their wounded after a battle instead of taking the mandatory approach of leaving them for dead. however, lamaril found out about kaladin's actions and asked sadeas to execute him. sadeas instead decided to let the wounded men stay, but withhold their pay and food to demonstrate why they were not a good use of the army's resources. lamaril soon recognized that kaladin's ambition was dangerous to his army's status quo, and told gaz that he needed to eliminate kaladin. gaz was hesitant, as kaladin had been giving him small bribes that he used towards his debt to lamaril, but suggested assassinating him. lamaril told him that he could not make a martyr of kaladin and that he needed to die in battle instead. prior to the army's next plateau assault, lamaril and gaz were seen speaking on the battlefield. gaz gave the other bridge crews new members despite bridge four's dwindling numbers, leaving them barely enough men to carry their bridge. bridge four was then placed at the head of a sadeas army assault on the tower, a large plateau that was particularly well-defended by the parshendi. kaladin successfully led bridge four in a new ""side carry"" technique to block the parshendi arrows, but their actions unwittingly caused the assault to fail. the parshendi simply targeted the other bridge crews instead, who disastrously attempted to copy the new technique without any practice. lamaril was angry, but kaladin convinced him that if he were executed, it would look like lamaril was trying to hide his endorsement of the failed side carry technique, since the soldiers saw him speaking to gaz immediately before the battle. lamaril instead had kaladin severely beaten, and he and gaz stole the spheres from his pouch. sadeas did not accept lamaril's attempts to blame the debacle on kaladin and gaz, and held lamaril accountable since he was the ranking lighteyes involved. sadeas personally executed him in the first hour after returning to the warcamp. he was replaced by brightlord matal; matal's wife, brightlady hashal, had a very low opinion of lamaril and his performance running the bridge crews. notes[edit]"
Thude,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Thude,"thude is a parshendi warrior in narak during the war of reckoning. he is part of a warpair with bila under the command of eshonai, in her personal division. eshonai believed that he was the best candidate to inherit her shards should she be incapacitated. he was friends with rlain as well. he meets with the alethi to arrange a parley to discuss peace. he shows concern about the new stormform when eshonai returns to narak after bonding the captive stormspren. he objects to rounding up those who refuse to take stormform, and escapes with the group of dissenters before they can be harmed.. they survived the highstorm and the everstorm, leaving the shattered plains and going to the floodplains on the east side. notes[edit]"
Essence Mark,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Essence_Mark,"an essence mark is a particular type of soulstamp that is designed to forge a person's memories, history, and soul for a brief period of time. essence marks are among the most powerful and most complex soulstamps a forger can create. in realmatic terms, an essence mark reforges the spiritual aspect of an individual to match the new history. essence marks are considered blasphemy by a number of cultures, including the grands of the rose empire, the mulla'dil strikers, and the dzhamarians. construction & use[edit] essence marks are the most difficult type of soulstamps to create, typically requiring years worth of development and construction, and are required to be attuned to a specific individual in order to function. when a human is soulstamped, the transformation lasts a relatively short period of time, and the best crafted stamps last approximately a day. this is due to the fact that the identity of a person, as opposed to an object, is constantly growing, changing and shifting. it may also be due to the fact that all humans are naturally invested with a small amount of investiture, and investiture resists change by other investiture. however, through large amounts of practice and research, it is possible to make essence marks that last far longer. if used continuously for years, the person may no longer need the essence mark to maintain the transformation. to create an essence mark, one must make hundreds of stamps, each one representing a small portion of the history or personality which you would wish to change. these stamps must be tested individually to make sure that each will take, and then networked together into a lattice on some external object. the lattice will be connected to the final stamp, which will act as a keystone for the other stamps, and will be the only one necessary to stamp. the lattice must maintain in contact with the skin of an individual to maintain its effects. a deep knowledge of the individual and the new history you wish to write is necessary to create the stamps for an essence mark. an augur would find their allomantic powers ""useful"" for making essence marks for themselves. known essence marks[edit] notes[edit]"
Regal,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Stormform,"""“forms of power, yes, but also forms of obedience. the gods commanded, and we did obey, always. always. ”-jaxlim"" regals are singers who bond with voidspren, granting them a transformation called a form of power. in the voidbringer hierarchy, they are ranked above common singers, and below the fused. singers sometimes formally refer to regals as chosen. mechanics[edit] formation and appearance[edit] to become a regal, a singer has to bond a voidspren; a non-sapient variety is used for this purpose. the form is assumed much like any other, by stepping into the storm with the mindset to bond an appropriate spren. unlike a fused possession, a form of power can be taken on both in highstorm and the everstorm. in some cases, odium may force a regal form upon a singer personally while the latter is in the everstorm. during the false desolation, ba-ado-mishram was able to connect to all singers on roshar and grant a large portion of them forms of power as well as voidlight. this is no longer possible since that unmade is now imprisoned in a gemstone. the forms of power come in many different shapes; their precise number is unknown, though higher than ten. regardless, they can always be recognized by having red eyes, as opposed to typical singer black. historically, they were associated with voidlight and ba-ado-mishram, though neither is necessary for their functioning. abilities[edit] unlike ordinary forms, regals possess powers that are explicitly supernatural, from shooting lightning from one's hands to understanding and speaking every language in the world (as such, a kandra wouldn't be able to mimic a regal). these powers do not seem to require any sort of external investiture input, but at least some are powered by voidlight. they are also generally stronger than normal singers or humans, including forms not intended for fighting. moreover, in contrast to fused possession, taking on a form of power does not strip the host of their personality, though it can alter their way of thinking. on the other hand, the regal form can be directly spoken to by odium, though this seems to only occur if the singer is caught in the everstorm. odium is also able to exert a significant amount of control over regals, in a manner similar to the influence ruin has over those with hemalurgic spikes. most notably, they tend to become more aggressive and have an exceptionally difficult time hearing ordinary rhythms, instead hearing those related to odium. it is possible that odium can force regals to obey him. despite their ties to odium, regals are not immune to effects tied to another shard, such as being pulled into one of honor's visions by the stormfather. known forms of power[edit] most forms of power are only known through listener songs; several were recorded in the song of secrets, the song of histories, and the song of winds. there are more than ten total. stormform[edit] ""“ stormform is said to causea tempest of wind and showersbeware its powers, beware its powers.though its coming brings the gods their night,it obliges a bloodred spren.beware its end, beware its end. ”- fourth stanza of the song of winds"" a singer bonded to a stormspren is granted stormform, a form of power that is commonly used for frontline soldiers and a fearsome foe on the battlefield. this form was the first used by the listeners, allowing them to call the everstorm into the physical realm and freeing the other singers from their captivity. with the return of the everstorms, stormforms are often used as elite troops, capable of reinforcing standard soldiers or serving in special units that carry out important tasks, such as the company that seized the sibling's crystal pillar in urithiru. appearance instead of the bulky external carapace armor granted by warform, a singer in stormform is protected by a more subtle armor that is nearly as effective. the singer's skin is covered in rows of durable protective ridges that poke out through the skin, which stretches tightly in some places. stormforms also have hairstrands are often absent in more martial forms, more prominent physical differences between the sexes than other forms, and barbed carapace on the backs of their hands. their face is protected by a carapace mask beneath the stormform's skin with ridges on the nose and cheeks, capable of deflecting a blade away from the face without causing too much damage. the ridged carapace breaks the skin above the cheeks and along the sides of the head, with a carapace gorget at the neck. the spiking armor plates present under their skin elsewhere on their bodies makes grappling with them difficult, jabbing attackers and preventing them from getting a decent hold. a stormform often has flashes of energy appear around them, such as sometimes flashing across their eyes or tiny nearly invisible lines of lighting flaring from their hands when they form a fist quickly. when they are preparing to summon their lightning their skin begins to crackle with energy. as they fight they cause flashes of light, sometimes emanating from their weapons when they connect with enemies. abilities and weaknesses despite looking comparatively lithe, a stormform regal is in fact significantly stronger than a warform singer, and even other forms of power. they are able to leap across the chasms of the shattered plains without a running start and posses a grip strength that allows them to easily hold the chasm walls when climbing them. the most overt power that stormform grants a singer is the ability to create and manipulate a red lightning in a variety of useful ways. stormforms are capable of unleashing grand bolts of lightning that electrocute and burn their enemies, cooking them alive in their armor. it is also capable of doing great damage to fortifications, with bolts used to destroy stone structures. it takes a moment for a stormform to summon a bolt of lightning and those nearby can sense the power building, as the stormform's skin begins to crackle with the red lightning. this ability to throw lightning is most deadly in close range. the lightning itself is difficult to control and moves unpredictably, sometimes moving the wrong direction or channeling directly into the ground. the flash of lightning is blindingly bright and creates a loud clap of thunder that is sometimes used as a signal and intimidates enemies. this thunderclap can be permanently deafening in close quarters, but as it is quieter than normal thunder, those shielded from the noise usually suffer no permanent hearing loss. when a stormform is killed, if their power has not been expended it can escape from their corpse and kill those nearby, particularly those standing in puddles. stormform regals are also capable of directly channeling the lightning into another person directly through physical contact, sending constant jolts of power through them, which creates an immensely painful burning sensation in the victim. their opponents are unable to withstand the power of this attack without stormlight healing to aid them. unleashing lightning into a person still generates a great deal of heat, burning through clothes, with the shock causing the victim's hair to stand on end. even when they are not intending to do harm, touching a stormform may cause the feeling of a little jolt of power. stormforms have also experimented with their powers in less directly martial ways. they have discovered that they can rewrite the polarity of a magnet with their lightning and use it to ignite the contents of pressurized vessels. this lightning power is not limitless though, subsequent blasts of lightning are often weaker than the first and after their voidlight has been expended, it is slow to renew and its absence may leave the stormform feeling limp. another weakness of stormform is ironically water, which makes their ability to throw bolts of lightning even less reliable. if a stormform is sufficiently drenched in water their power will be ruined and unable to renew properly until they are dry, slipping away from the stormform every time it starts to return. their lightning may also be counteracted by intentionally placing lightning rods to draw the bolts of power themselves to protect soldiers fighting stormform regals. their powers may also be fully dampened by a suppression fabrial, which causes their lightning to vanish. another ability granted by stormform is some immunity to the effects of the storms, allowing them to move through the winds and darknesss of a storm with relative ease, although they are not immune to the dangers the storms present. according to legend they were able to control and summon the storms themselves, it is uncertain if this refers to the power to summon the everstorm from shadesmar. prior to its arrival in the physical realm, a stormform regal was capable of summoning a small portion of the everstorm themselves. they could cause a small tempest of wind, lightning and dark mist to appear briefly between their hands, although it is unknown if they maintain this power following the arrival of the everstorm. it is uncertain whether summoning the everstorm was a task only the stormforms could complete or whether they were simply chosen as the form best suited for the task. envoyform[edit] while not described in any known listener songs, envoyforms are an important non-combatant form of power available to the singers, often employed by the fused as voices or interpreters. a singer in envoyform is extremely tall but not particularly muscular, with long arms and legs. envoyform regals stand above tall alethi humans, common singers, and even some forms of power such as stormform, though still shorter than some brands of fused. the form grants no carapace armor, but much in the way of decoration, inspiring awe among common singers and fear in humans that see an envoyform. an envoyform's body is not extensively covered in carapace, and the carapace that is present on their body is primarily ornamental and fragile. it is present in places such as along the cheeks and in ridges on the back of an envoyform's hands. this light carapace is not as useful for insulating an envoyform from the wind or the cold as the more extensive carapace of other forms. an envoyform also possesses long hairstrands and more pronounced sexual characteristics, such as small breasts for femalen singers. an envoyform voice is often dressed in striking fashions designed to augment their forms and skin patterns as well as inspire more attention in a crowded room. envoyform grants a host of supernatural abilities primarily related to translation and interpretation. the most notable power is the ability to speak, read, and understand any language, whether human or singer. the ability presumably involves some manipulation of the power of connection. after hearing several sentences in an unknown language, an envoyform feels as though the words blur in their mind before shifting into something understandable and they gain the ability to speak and understand that language. while this power is capable of allowing a envoyform to understand the meaning of a name, it cannot give them any context or additional information beyond that. there are also times that this translation power may fail. odium himself may prevent an envoyform from interpreting certain conversations or songs, leaving envoyforms with a feeling that they can almost understand but that their powers shy back from comprehending, and there are other times it seems to fail an envoyform. in order to properly interpret the meaning of writing, an envoyform must first know that the symbols they look at are writing before their translation powers activate. given more time and practice holding this form, its abilities grow even grander, allowing an envoyform to intuit instructions from merely a hum, or a simple gesture, a talent particularly useful when serving a fused master. this makes serving as the voice of an important fused one possible position for an envoyform singer, because of its ability to speak the ancient fused language. additionally, as many fused do not bother to learn modern languages, envoyforms are necessary as interpreters, allowing fused to communicate their will to common singers. they are also useful as propagandists, such as when venli is used by odium to help craft a foundation myth for the common singers of the voidbringer forces. this form is somewhat fragile and not as physically powerful or athletic as other forms of power, but in it, an envoyform regal is incredibly nimble and remains noticeably stronger than the average human. decayform[edit] ""“decayform destroys the souls of dreams. / a form of gods, to avoid it seems. / seek not its touch, nor beckon its screams, deny it. / watch where you walk, your toes to tread. / o'er hill or rocky riverbed / hold dear to fears that fill your head, defy it. ”-27th stanza of the song of secrets"" nothing is known of decayform beyond its mentions in the songs of the listeners. there are no known singers bearing this form in the true desolation as of yet. it is not attained using decayspren, as they are not voidspren. direform[edit] direform is a form of power that has a crest of spikes on its head and neck. the abilities of this form are unknown. during the singer occupation of urithiru, some regals serving as the head jailer or guards in the tower are in direform. nightform[edit] ""“nightform predicting what will be, / the form of shadows, mind to foresee. / as the gods did leave, the nightform whispered. / a new storm will come, someday to break. / a new storm a new world to make. / a new storm a new path to take, the nightform listens. ”-17th stanza of the song of secrets"" little is known of nightform beyond its mentions in the songs of the listeners. the song of secrets implies that nightform regals have precognitive abilities, perhaps related to fortune or the spiritual realm. the songs indicate that at some point in the past the nightforms may have seen visions of the everstorm and the contest of champions. during the singer occupation of urithiru lezian posted nightform regals to guard lirin and hesina in urithiru, likely at raboniel's suggestion. relayform[edit] relayform is a form of power with a sleek appearance that is often taken by scouts. there are no other known details about this form's abilities. during the occuptation of urithiru, some regals in relayform served raboniel, scouting the tower and delivering reports to venli, raboniel's voice. smokeform[edit] ""“smokeform for hiding and slipping between men. / a form of power, like human surges. / bring it 'round again. / though crafted of gods, / it was by unmade hand. / leaves its force to be but one of foe or friend. ”-127th stanza of the song of histories"" ""“smokeform for hiding and slipping 'tween men. / a form of power-like surges of spren / do we dare to wear this form again? it spies. / crafted of gods, this form we fear. / by unmade touch its curse to bear, / formed from shadow-and death is near. it lies. ”-51st stanza of the song of secrets"" nothing is known of smokeform beyond its mentions in the songs of the listeners, which imply that this form may grant some sort of ability to hide or move nimbly. there are no known singers bearing this form in the true desolation as of yet. unknown[edit] axindweth suggests to venli

Sheler,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sheler,"brightlord sheler is a commander in meridas amaram's army from alethkar on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] he is a lighteyes of the fifth dahn. he is very arrogant and self-righteous, even as a prisoner. history[edit] in 1168, sheler commanded a company fighting for sadeas princedom in amaram's army during a battle with hallaw's forces. a group of his soldiers became outnumbered while defending a hilltop and were suffering heavy casualties, but sheler ordered them to stand their ground. one of his squadleaders, varth, sacrificed several messenger boys as a distraction, including tien. sheler was presumably acting on orders from amaram, who wanted hallaw's forces to bunch up so that he could ride in with his cavalry and rout them; he placed his own glory above the lives of his men. ""“you must contact my highprince and accept payment based on my rank!”-sheler, demanding the right of ransom from dieno"" sheler later moved to the border to fight the herdazians, and he learned their language over time. using the invasion of his homeland by singers as an excuse, he robbed and murdered herdazian civilians and abused their women. when he was taken captive by the herdazian general dieno enne calah (aka the mink), he demanded the ""right of ransom"", but dieno told him that he had forfeited that right by committing war crimes. instead, sheler was given three options for punishment: beheading by the women that he abused, being tortured with a hammer and hung from a cliff with no protection from the highstorm, or wrestling ""the hog"". he chose to fight the hog, assuming it was a pig, and began to formulate plans to seek vengeance on the herdazians for humiliating him. he was doused in a foul-smelling oil and left shackled on the beach as the herdazians used a horn to summon the hog, which was actually a huge sea creature with enormous claws. sheler saw the creature break the surface of the ocean while the herdazians placed wagers on how long he would survive; his ultimate fate is unknown. trivia[edit] - sheler's company uses a black - with shesh and lerel. - sheler states that he is cousin to the highlord, presumably referring to meridas amaram. - the description of the hog is similar to that of large - such as the - . notes[edit]"

Avarak Matal,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Matal,"brightlord avarak matal is a lighteyed officer in the sadeas warcamp on the shattered plains of roshar. he is the captain of the sadeas bridge crews, although his wife hashal seems to exert more authority than he does. appearance and personality[edit] he is nearly as tall as kaladin, but he is spindly with delicate hands. he wears a sword at his side, but kaladin believes that it is mostly there for fashion. he and hashal consider themselves close associates of torol sadeas, and are presumably of a fairly high dahn. history[edit] becoming captain of the bridge crews, kakab 1173[edit] matal was made captain of the sadeas bridge crews after lamaril's execution following the disastrous ""side carry"" battle. matal's wife hashal claimed that he had asked to be assigned the captaincy of the bridge crews in order to see to it that they were run smoothly and efficiently; kaladin assumed this was a fabrication since the position was not prestigious. matal rarely addressed the crews directly, instead allowing hashal to deal with them using his authority. he rarely spoke when hashal was present, and only took personal command on the battlefield where women were not allowed; for example, he would give the bridge crews orders to form up and run before a plateau assault. success on the battlefield, tanatev 1174[edit] during a sadeas plateau run, kaladin attempted to divert the attention of the parshendi from the bridge crews by dressing in singer remains and using himself as bait. matal screamed loudly at kaladin when he realized something unexpected was happening since kaladin's previous attempt at innovation had resulted in lamaril's execution. kaladin's covert use of surgebinding allowed the risky strategy to succeed, and the crews suffered almost no casualties. torol sadeas approached after the battle and matal assumed he would be angry; to his credit, he took responsibility for kaladin's actions. however, sadeas assumed that matal had approved the plan beforehand and was pleased that his risk paid off, stating that he would likely be compelled to give matal a promotion. matal was extremely angry at kaladin for putting his life on the line, but did not discipline him since he knew he could not afford to lose him. matal later gave kaladin and bridge four permission to leave shen behind on bridge runs due to his foul temper and behavior after he saw how they were treating the corpses of the parshendi. battle of the tower, tanatash 1174[edit] matal was later seen shouting orders when the horns sounded before the battle of the tower. during the battle, matal stayed back from the fighting. kaladin saw him speaking to the rear guard across the chasm from bridge four's position. confused by matal's actions, kaladin realized that sadeas planned to betray dalinar and the kholin army by retreating and abandoning them. after retreating from the battle, matal directed the bridge crews back towards the sadeas warcamp. kaladin and bridge four lagged at the rear of the army, drawing matal's ire. kaladin told matal that his men were tired, and convinced him to allow them to follow at their own pace since they had their own bridge to cross with; he secretly hoped to desert the army. matal agreed, thinking that their slow pace would cause them to be hunted down by parshendi and he would be rid of kaladin. bridge four was ultimately able to rescue dalinar and many of his men. after the battle concluded, kaladin observed matal furiously focusing on bridge four while the highprinces debriefed. kaladin assumed that sadeas would have matal executed, based on lamaril's fate. notes[edit]"

Skeletal,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Skeletal,"a skeletal is a construct created by bloodsealing that magically brings the bones of a person or other creature back to life. skeletals are terrifyingly effective, they are skilled warriors that ruthlessly pursue their targets and never tire. characteristics[edit] creation and appearance[edit] skeletals are created from the bones of the dead, using a process known as bloodsealing. this magic originates in the nation of dzhamar and is similar to forgery. a version of a soulstamp (typically made from bone) is inked in fresh blood and pressed into the forehead of a skeleton's skull; the blood reanimates the bones and gives the creature life. human skeletons are highly preferred; animal skeletons can also be used, but the resulting skeletals will not be as adept at following commands from the bloodsealer. the bones do not have to originate in dzhamar. functioning[edit] the magic of animating a skeletal is quite similar to a lifeless. the skeleton is ""tricked"" into thinking it is alive through the use of investiture. however, unlike the lifeless, the corpse does not retain any of its original soul. the skeletal instead becomes attuned to the person whose blood was used to ink the seal, and can sense them from anywhere. when a bloodsealer stamps the skeletal's skull, the source of the blood may feel pain in the their open wound. the stamps must be periodically renewed with fresh blood. it is not strictly necessary to renew them as often as other types of bloodsealing stamps, but their ability to track the source of the blood wanes after twenty-four hours. once reanimated, the bones do not have muscles or connecting tissue, and are presumably able to move through the magic of the dor. skeletals can be reanimated multiple times, but the skeleton must remain whole for the animation process to function. if bones are removed or broken, particularly critical bones like the skull or vertebrae, the creature will collapse and not move until it is repaired. if any bones are broken beyond repair or lost, wooden carvings of the bones can take their place. weedfingers sharpens the bones of his skeletals to make removing them difficult. the bloodsealer maintains a connection to the skeletals while they are active, and is able to somehow give commands to them. bloodsealers can animate at least five skeletals simultaneously. if the connections to their skeletals are suddenly severed, a bloodsealer may go into shock. abilities and uses[edit] skeletals can receive different types of commands, but their primary use is in battle. it is unclear whether skeletals are truly sapient. they are able to perform very complex tasks and seem to act independently, but they only do so in service of the command given by the bloodsealer. they are skilled fighters, and are capable of working in teams and wielding weapons. they are nearly impossible for normal people to defeat in melee combat; they cannot be stabbed, they have unlimited stamina, and their bones are difficult to remove or break. if directed, they will relentlessly track the source of their seal's blood without any known limitations; they can track someone through walls and over a great distance. their tracking ability is not affected by the use of essence marks. cultural perception[edit] bloodsealing is seen as an abomination outside of dzhamar. strikers are rivals of dzhamarians and have contempt for their ""unnatural"" magic, but people from other nations also view bloodsealing as horrible and frightening. skeletals are often referred to pejoratively as a bloodsealer's ""pets""; most people are terrified by them and will flee if they believe that any are nearby. people are so afraid of skeletals that even the threat of their use is often sufficient to intimidate or coerce someone into complying with the bloodsealer's demands. history[edit] weedfingers was hired by the heritage faction to ensure that wan shailu did not escape the rose palace while she worked on ashravan's essence mark. this included the use of skeletals; weedfingers asked for shai's bones as payment. when shai did attempt to escape, zu drew her blood with his sword, allowing weedfingers to send five skeletals to track her down. however, shai transformed into shaizan and defeated all of them. she then found a stupefied weedfingers hiding in a closet and informed him that she would be taking the skulls so he could not send the skeletals after her again. notes[edit]"

Yu-nerig,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Yu-nerig,"yu-nerig are a species of marine greatshell native to the seas near marabethia on roshar. they are known for their succulent flavor. appearance and anatomy[edit] like all greatshell species, yu-nerig contain gemhearts - smaller than those of larger species like chasmfiends, but still of respectable size. the chrysalises they make when they pupate are similar in shape and texture to those of chasmfiends. ecology[edit] yu-nerig normally live in the sea depths, and only come onto land to pupate. they also form symbiotic bonds with spren, like most creatures on roshar. this is one of the factors that allow them, like all greatshells, to grow to such large sizes. lore[edit] marabethian criminal code allows the prisoners condemned to capital punishment to be used as a bait for the yu-nerig in order to be pardoned. the criminals are dangled over a seaside cliff when the water is at high tide with a cut sliced in each of their cheeks, and told their crimes will be pardoned if they hang there for a week and are not eaten by the yu-nerig. they are usually attacked within the first day, however most prisoners still opt to take the chance. the marabethian saying of ""you have eyes of red and blue"" is a reference to this, as they say the prisoners can see only two things: red for the blood dripping from their wounds and blue for the sea. notes[edit]"
Tien,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tien,"""“it’s not as bad as it seems, kaladin... things are never as bad as they seem. you’ll see. ”-tien to kaladin"" tien is the second son of lirin and hesina and brother to kaladin and oroden. tien is two years kaladin’s junior and eighteen years older than oroden. he is pressed into highmarshal amaram’s army, where he is killed during battle. appearance and personality[edit] ""“it's just hard to be gloomy when he’s around. ”-kaladin about tien"" he has a mix of unruly brown and black hair, and is small for his age. he has a slight build and round cheeks that are often flushed. due to his size and childlike features, tien is often mistaken for being younger than his actual age. this has led to him being mocked on occasion by the other children in hearthstone. despite roshone's treatment of his family and the towns ostracism, tien liked living in hearthstone and had not considered moving away before being conscripted. tien has a fixation with rocks, of which he owns a large catalogued collection. some of the rocks in tien’s collection show off hidden strata if doused with water or change color under certain lights. due to his aversion with blood, tien is unable to apprentice to his father and instead works for ral, the town carpenter. ral finds his apprentice frustrating as tien is easily distracted and will work on his own projects instead of those set by his master. tien is an excitable person and always seems to find beauty in things that others would consider mundane. he is an optimist and tries to please those around him as well as brighten their day. he shares similar traits with shallan davar, a fellow lightweaver, both of whom are artistically talented and work to raise the spirits of those around them. tien was seen as a burst of sunshine by those around him, particularly kaladin, and did not want people to see him differently, implying some self-esteem issues. attributes and abilities[edit] before he died, tien bonded a cryptic and swore at least the first oath. as a lightweaver, he could access the surges of illumination and transformation, had enhanced mnemonic abilities and experienced color and light differently to those around him. tien's perception of someone could also cause slight alterations to their mood. tien attracted a cryptic due to his hiding belief that he was not a good person, as he knew people saw him as a burst of sunshine and he didn't want them to see differently. the skybreakers knew tien was bonded to a cryptic while he served in amaram's army, and believed him to be the only surgebinder within amaram's forces. through their spying on the group, the ghostbloods are aware that there was at least one manifested radiant within amaram's army, who had been killed. this information is passed on to shallan, from mraize. the whereabouts of tien's spren are unknown. history[edit] childhood[edit] ""“tien smiled, then set a rock on the ground... tien had a habit of finding those and thinking they were incredibly precious. ”-kaladin about tien's rock collection."" as a young boy, tien often spent time with his brother kaladin. the pair were friends with laral, the daughter of brightlord wistiow, and also spent time around the other children in the town; when he was eight, he and his brother hung out with jam, one of the other boys in the town. jam’s father had been teaching him how to use a quarterstaff and the other children of the town were intrigued to find out what he had learnt. tien’s father, lirin, did not approve of his sons spending time with the older children in the town, particularly if it interfered with kaladin’s duties as surgeon’s assistant. tien often played with kaladin and laral, climbing rocks and searching the area for wildlife. on the day of wistiow’s death, tien spent time collecting rocks and looking for lurgs with his two friends. he presented his brother with one of the rocks he had found; a weathered stone that contained a hidden pattern of colored strata. tien showed his older brother how the pattern would reveal itself when water was applied to the rock face. kaladin attempted to return the stone to tien, however, his brother insisted that he keep it. tien often found rocks that he would pass along to kaladin, in the hopes that they would help to lift his mood. they began looking for lurgs, quickly finding one amongst the boulders. after laral joined them, they dissolved the lurg's cocoon to watch it jump around, looking for food. when the creature settled down to respin its cocoon, kaladin manipulated it onto a rock so that it could be moved around without being further disturbed. he gave the lurg to tien, who then moved off to search for more of the amphibians. while he searched, tien’s brother and laral moved down the hill to speak with some of the other children in the town and a fight broke out. after the other boys had left, tien gifted his brother another stone that he had found while lurg hunting. roshone[edit] when tien was eleven years old, the governance of hearthstone was taken over by brightlord roshone. on the day of roshone’s arrival, tien was waiting for his family in the square, having saved them places near the water barrels. despite tien’s father’s attempts to welcome the new citylord, the initial introduction of roshone went poorly. roshone's animosity towards tien's father, led him to target the family, cutting off their means of income and pushing them towards poverty. much of roshone's grudge against lirin stemed from his inheritance of the late brightlord wisitow's wealth. eighteen months after the arrival of roshone, tien’s father met with the brightlord. hesina was tasked with distracting her two sons, to keep them away from the meeting. tien had found a new rock, that he shared with his mother and brother while the three prepared the evening meal. he found the rock fascinating as it changed color when viewed from different angles. hesina, suggested that the change was caused by the spren of the rock and the three spoke further about spren and souls. tien disagreed with his mother, explaining that he thought the change was caused by light instead of spren. during the conversation, kaladin snuck away to join his father at roshone’s manor. after the dinner, lirin admitted to kaladin that the spheres had been stolen, and requested that kaladin did not inform his brother of what he had learnt. life for the family continued to get worse after tien’s father had been unable to save the life of roshone’s son, rillir. when rillir was brought to lirin after being attacked by a whitespine, tien was pulled away from the surgery room by his mother, due to his aversion to blood. the weeping[edit] six months later, tien found his brother on the roof of their house. knowing kaladin often struggled during the weeping, tien did what he could to support his brother, sitting with him and giving him an intricately carving of a horse. unable to work as a surgeon’s assistant, tien had been taken on by the town’s carpenter, ral. tien had a natural talent for carving, however often got distracted, to the displeasure of his master. ral often got frustrated at tien, though did admit that the boy had a talent for woodcarving. hesina joins her sons after a time, and they discussed the family’s situation. despite their predicament, tien liked living in hearthstone and did not wish to move with kaladin to kharbranth, though he was excited at the opportunities presented to his brother. during the conversation, kaladin realised that though his father had begun to spend wistiow’s spheres, he did so to deceive roshone, and make him believe their situation was worse than it seemed. lirin found his family on the roof and they relocated to the town square to greet highmarshal amaram, who had been passing through the region. while he visited roshone, amaram engaged in recruiting several members of the town to his army. when not enough men volunteered, tien, along with four other men, were pressed into the army to expand its ranks. unlike his father or brother, tien was not immune from enlistment due to his profession. lirin attempted to prevent tien’s recruitment, however was stopped by the highmarshal before he could cause a scene. amaram promised to make the boy a messenger to keep him out of danger and away from the fighting. the thought of joining the army terrified tien. unable to let the matter lie, kaladin offered to take his brother’s place, however roshone was insistent. kaladin enlisted along side his brother, in the hopes of keeping him safe and they both moved away from hearthstone. the army[edit] ""“gotta do what you can to stay alive, son. turn a liability into an advantage whenever you can. remember that, if you live. ”-varth talking to kaladin about tien"" tien and kaladin were separated after being drafted, despite kaladin's belief that they were meant to be assigned to the same squad. kaladin searched for his brother after their separation, enlisting the help of his squad leader tukks, who eventually located tien in squad seven. while in squad seven, tien was given rudimentary training with a spear, and then shifted into a deep reserve unit. tien hoped that he would be able to travel to the shattered plains to join the king's army. less than four months after being drafted, tien was killed during battle against brightlord hallaw. during the encounter, two other undertrained messenger boys were assigned to varth's squad, and tien volunteered to join them, in order to help them out. unable to use the boys effectively in combat, varth positioned the three at the front of the lines, to act as a distraction for the enemy. he saw the three messengers as liabilities due to their lack of training. tien and the two other messengers were killed by an enemy lighteyes, after varth pulled his squad pulled back, leaving the three of them exposed to the enemy. kaladin, who had been looking for his brother during the battle, arrived moments before tien was struck down and killed. he lay on the battlefield with his brother’s corpse for hours, not returning to camp until long after the battle had ended. tien’s parents received notice of his death from kaladin, shortly after the incident. relationships[edit] kaladin[edit] ""“how is it you can always smile?... it’s dreadful outside, your master treats you like crem, and your family is slowly being strangled by the citylord. and yet you smile. how, tien? and why is it that you make me want to smile too? ”-kaladin about tien"" tien is almost always able to lift his brother's mood and helps kaladin during his bouts of depression. he often gifts kaladin rocks, as a way to try and help him feel better, but is also a good judge of when kaladin needs company rather than support. despite kaladin’s request of his brother, tien always called him by his full name instead of his childhood nickname of kal. tien and kaladin often spend time together as children and play pranks on the other members of their family. during their childhoods, they would wrestle for fun as well as play catch and climb rocks with laral. of the three of them, laral was always the better climber. tien's death greatly affected kaladin, for which he still feels immense guilt and anger over. after his brothers death, kaladin began to recruit young boys to his army unit, who had been put in similar positions to tien, in the hopes of saving them. he also threw himself into training to distract himself from his brothers death, until he was eventually pulled out of his single mindedness by tarah. he continued to carry around tien's rocks while in the army, though rarely brought them out, and mistook others to be his brother both before and after he was made a slave. unable to face his parents and his broken promises, kaladin intended to re-enlist at the end of his four year tour, and continued to carry his guilt after being forced into slavery. after amaram's betrayal, kaladin began blaming the brightlord, along with himself, for breaking the promises he had made. even after being freed from slavery, kaladin still refused to contact his parents because of his brother's death. many years later, when kaladin is attempting suicide after teft's death, dalinar uses his bondsmith abilities to connect kaladin to a ""memory"" of tien, showing kaladin a vision similar to ones dalinar has seen. in the vision, tien manages to convince kaladin that his friends' deaths aren't his fault, and that kaladin was able to help them in their difficult times, and that's what matters. this leads kaladin to speak his fourth ideal. it is unclear if this is actually tien's soul, or if it is simply a memory of him. trivia[edit] - there was no specific inspiration for the relationship between kaladin and tien; instead it grew naturally out of kaladin's characterization. - brandon has also said he has a preference away from family relationships that cause isolation, as he finds the dynamics within families interesting and important to readers. - it is mostly a coincidence that tien, a surgeon's son, has a name that contains the - . notes[edit]"

"" khen: ""if it means they can't take us again? yes, i'd kill him. i won't go back, ton. "" ―discussing kaladin"" khen was a slave in sadeas's princedom but escaped after the first everstorm. she became part of a group of singers, including sah and ton, and they traveled to revolar under the guidance of yixli, a voidspren. while travelling, she and sah played a card game. along the way, the group took kaladin captive when he submitted willingly. kaladin freed himself from his bonds a few days later but stayed with the group and taught them how to survive while on the run. khen cut herself with kaladin's knife while cutting firewood, and kaladin cleaned the cut and taught her how best to care for the wound to prevent attracting rotspren and infection. during an unexpected highstorm, khen and her group took shelter in a lighteyes' stormbunker after kaladin struck a deal with the man. when inside, khen promised kaladin that she would speak for him when they reached the gathering. ""“he is not our captive. he was one of the humans' slaves, like us. he wishes to join and fight.”-khen speaking for kaladin"" once she reached revolar, the group joined the voidbringer army gathering to attack kholinar. khen spoke on kaladin's behalf, but he left upon seeing the fused, revealing himself as a human spy. khen's group was punished for harboring him and put to work hauling lumber, where she met moash. an overseer informed them they were building siege equipment for the assault on kholinar and that khen, moash, and her group of singers would be fighting on the front line. khen, angry with their situation, argued with sah, stating that they were being unfairly treated by their own gods. she began to feel helpless, with no idea what to do. after moash failed to convinced leshwi to treat the group more favorably, he began training them in combat skills in preparation for the attack on kholinar. khen witnessed sah's death by noromin during the battle in kholinar and killed him in turn. she watched moash kill elhokar. after the voidbringers won the battle, she was granted her freedom, but she decided to stay and help rebuild the city alongside moash. ten months later, khen told moash she was leaving kholinar, as she wanted to really live with her own mind and passions and instead felt as if she'd just woken up and started killing. they discuss becoming ""unchained"" by giving negative emotions to odium, but khen saw that moash was still chained to his emotions by kaladin. moash invited her to return and fight alongside him again if she ever did become unchained, ending their conversation. relationships[edit] moash[edit] ""“ we heard something. made us want to be near you. ”- khen speaking to moash"" moash travels with khen and her group from revolar to kholinar as slaves, where he earns some respect from them. when the alethi man hears khen's frustration at their treatment at the hands of the fused, moash speaks with leshwi on their behalf, disappointed that the singers are not kinder to their own than the humans. afterward, he trains them to fight with spears so that they will not be defenseless in the coming battle at kholinar. they fight side by side in kholinar palace, and when khen is granted freedom after their victory, she decided to stay and help rebuild in order to stay close to moash. later moash receives the name ""vyre"" from leshwi, and khen explains the meaning of the name to him. she doesn't approve of moash's treating jezrien's honorblade with inferiority. when she decides to leave kholinar, she feels she owes moash an explanation, even though he does not expect one. sah[edit] ""“don't you care what our own gods are doing to us? ”-khen to sah"" among the group of singers that khen travels with after escaping, her closest relationship is with sah. khen often includes sah in her decision making, and expresses her frustrations to him regarding their treatment under the fused. she is angered by sah's lack of emotional response regarding their situation. when sah is killed by noromin, khen avenges his death. kaladin[edit] ""“no matter what you are told, know this: i do not wish to be your enemy. ”-kaladin to khen"" when khen's party first captures kaladin, she votes to kill him in fear that he would escape and lead other humans to them; she emphasizes that she would do the act herself if necessary. after kaladin escapes and begins assisting her people, khen's attitude towards kaladin softens. as they weather the first highstorm in a bunker secured by the human, she promises that she will speak in his favor upon reaching revolar. when they arrive, she insists that kaladin is not their captive and explains that he wants to fight with the singers. despite kaladin's betrayal, khen seems to harbor little anger towards him. notes[edit]"

Leshwi,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Leshwi,"""“what is your passionate fury, moash, the man with an ancient singer's name? ”-leshwi to moash"" lady leshwi is a singer and high ranking member of the shanay-im, a type of fused. she is instrumental in bringing moash to odium's side. appearance and personality[edit] leshwi has the seemingly rare physical trait of black, white, and red marbling on her face. her eyes are ruby like and colored deep red. little more can be said about her appearance since she, like all fused, possesses another singer's body. while flying, leshwi wears a long red robe. she is a field commander, and one of the leaders of the singers during the siege of kholinar. in her view, this is because she is one of the few fused that are still sane. leshwi chooses her station carefully. she's a fused of high enough station that the leaders defer to her but not high enough that she is required to stay out of fights. passion is an important virtue to leshwi. this likely is related to the fact that odium believes 'passion' to be his intent. leshwi requires those who serve her to have passion and will not hire those who do not demonstrate it. she is not afraid to speak her mind, even in the presence of people ranked more highly than her and even if it goes against social conventions. she is also more open-minded than some of the other fused. during the last desolation, she was reincarnated into a malen body, but has her beard shaved by a barber, and keeps her hair long. she actively hates the whiskers that grow upon her, even when soft and faint. it is not known if she feels general dysphoria at her malen body, or if it is specific to her facial hair. abilities and attributes[edit] leshwi is able to use voidlight and is skilled with the surge of gravitation. like all fused, while she heals from most wounds as long as she has voidlight, damage to her gemheart is instantly fatal. when leshwi fights moash she uses a long, curved parshendi sword. when she fights kaladin, she prefers a spear. she is considered one of the better fighters among the fused. history[edit] mortal[edit] little is known of leshwi's previous life, except that she was friends with an honorspren named riah, and at some point, presumably during the first desolation she died and was reborn as one of the fused. recruiting moash[edit] when moash, graves, febrth and fia set up a camp, leshwi and three other fused attacked them. only moash was able to fight back effectively; his companions were dead within seconds. moash used his shardblade to fight leshwi, but when she realized that moash isn't well practiced with the sword she attacked more fiercely. she was surprised when moash dismissed his shardblade, dashed away, and picked up a spear. she then lashed moash into the air, but he pulled her with him and killed leshwi midair by ramming a knife in her chest. leshwi's companions took moash captive after that. later, during the siege of kholinar, moash demanded to speak to a fused in charge, and he was brought to leshwi. while hovering in the sky, the two of them had a long conversation. leshwi said that 'moash' is a singer name and reveals to moash that she is the one whom he killed before. because leshwi was impressed by moash's passion, she explained to him why the fused are at war with mankind. after this conversation, she let moash go as a free man, but moash chose not to leave. in the aftermath of the battle of kholinar leshwi visited moash during his work clearing rubble. she knew that he was curious about why they were destroying the kholinar palace even more, but said that he will get to know why in due time. they were probably looking for elhokar's cryptic. leshwi was pleased that moash was content with that answer, and ordered him to come up to the palace because hnanan had a request for him. after moash killed jezrien at hnanan's request leshwi and eight other fused came to him again. they offered him jezrien's honorblade, but leshwi warned him that 'moash' will be no more. moash accepted this fate, and leshwi gave him a new name: vyre, which means ""he who quiets."" evacuation of hearthstone[edit] during the evacuation of hearthstone, leshwi was among the three flights of heavenly ones, and she dueled kaladin. during the battle, she wielded a raysium spear with a gemstone at its base, capable of drawing in a knights radiant's stormlight. leshwi stabbed sigzil with this spear but spared his life as a sign of respect to kaladin for sparing a heavenly one earlier in the battle. after another exchange with kaladin that left them both wounded, leshwi accepted a draw and allowed kaladin to defend a group of civilians under attack by lezian. after returning to kholinar, leshwi attended a meeting of the nine, where she, with her voice, venli, described the fourth bridge to the nine and explained how it seemed to operate. during the meeting she claimed the right to battle kaladin over lezian, enraging him. she also showed disapproval of raboniel's plan to besiege urithiru. occupation of urithiru[edit] leshwi offered up all of her servants save two to raboniel, including venli, and gave venli orders to bring her reports on raboniel's actions. once urithiru was taken by the fused, leshwi took custody of lirin, hesina, and oroden to protect them from lezian. leshwi accepted another duel with kaladin but showed mercy to him when she discovered he didn't have access to all his surges. the duel ended when kaladin escaped to destroy a node of the sibling. later, venli revealed that she is a radiant and leshwi was overjoyed, proclaiming that the spren have forgiven the singers. leshwi asked venli whether her spren knew her old friend, an honorspren named riah. venli says she does not but, that there are spren willing to bond singers again. leshwi replied that her soul has been too long owned by someone else for that. lezian's soldiers then attacked the unarmed humans protecting the unconscious knights radiant; venli whispered that she was caught between two worlds and didn't know what to do. leshwi responded, ""it's all right, voice. i know the answer."" she then unsheathed her sword, flew directly to the fight, and commanded the singer troops to halt. when they didn't, leshwi attacked them, and her troops joined her. singer fought singer; on one side were leshwi, five heavenly ones, about twenty regals, and the human civilians. on the other side were lezian's singer troops. lezian's troops were afraid of the fused and soon fled, leaving their dead behind. leshwi insisted that the humans she had fought alongside submit so that leshwi could explain the situation to raboniel and not seem in rebellion. the humans refused, and violence seemed inevitable, until rlain took command of the situation. he told leshwi that she had defied odium and so would be punished unless she and her troops escaped with him. leshwi reluctantly agreed. before they could depart, deepest ones and hundreds of stormforms arrived to exterminate them; they attacked, killing, among others, one of the heavenly ones. leshwi's group of heavenly ones, regals, and humans would have been overwhelmed, but kaladin arrived in his new shardplate, which he sent out to protect those about to be killed, including adin, dabbid, and leshwi herself. she had speared a stormform that had released a flash of lightning that enveloped her, but was saved by kaladin's plate. simultaneously, the sibling bonded with navani and the defenses of urithiru were fully restored. the fused, including leshwi, collapsed unconscious. afterwards, once they had been brought to the oathgate, leshwi and the four surviving heavenly ones regained consciousness. they, along with rlain, venli, dul, mazish, and the others that venli had recruited, were transported to narak via the oathgate, where leshwi helped find the free group of listeners. relationships[edit] moash[edit] leshwi initially was angered at moash because he managed to kill her so unexpectedly, but over time this anger was converted into admiration for moash's passion. leshwi is intrigued by moash's motives, and he impresses her so much that she releases him. however, just before releasing him leshwi told moash to prove himself, and when he recalled this he voluntary returned to his parshmen crew, what seemed to be what leshwi hoped he would do. moash's assassinations of elhokar and jezrien seem to have boosted his and leshwi's reputation among the fused, and hnanan expresses pride at leshwi for picking out moash. eventually the fused hold moash in such high regard that they give him jezrien's honorblade. kaladin[edit] ""“it is rare to find a human who can fight in the skies well enough to be a challenge for me. ”-leshwi about kaladin"" leshwi and kaladin seem to have a mutual respect. leshwi sees him as a rare challenge to battle in the skies. they have multiple duels, none of which end with a clear winner. when kaladin's powers are suppressed by corruption of the sibling, leshwi does not take the advantage and kill the windrunner, instead she shows honor in not wanting to beat him in an unfair fight. kaladin also values her opinion of him, making sure she understood he hadn't technically accepted a duel and wasn't fleeing when he left. after the events in urithiru and the fighting between the singers and the humans, kaladin offers leshwi aid and a place to stay in narak, but she declines. venli[edit] venli serves as the voice of lady leshwi, expressing leshwi's desires to others. initially leshwi values venli for her unique envoyform talents, however treats her coldly due to her position as a servant. after her voice's actions in urithiru, spying on raboniel and helping leshwi protect kaladin's family, leshwi begins to warm to her. when venli reveals she has bonded a radiant spren leshwi is overjoyed. notes[edit]"

Ornery Chull,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ornery_Chull,"the ornery chull is a bar in the kholin warcamp on the shattered plains of roshar. it is a wooden structure constructed on the leeward side of a larger stone building. it uses fire for light due to concerns over intoxicated patrons stealing spheres. the main room tends to be crowded, smoky, and loud; the tavern also has private dining rooms off of a hallway in the back that are usually used by wealthy merchants. popular drinks include wines and lavis ale; it does not serve horneater lager, as it melts their cups. history[edit] after bridge four was freed during the war of reckoning, they often patronized the ornery chull; it was a favorite of moash and particularly peet, as he was enamored with a barmaid named ka. lunamor preferred other taverns that served horneater lager. one of the private rooms at the tavern was used by graves and other members of the diagram to host their meeting with moash and kaladin regarding elhokar kholin. notes[edit]"
Ialai Sadeas,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ialai,"brightlady ialai sadeas is a noble alethi lighteyes on roshar. she was formerly married to highprince torol sadeas and was associated with the sons of honor. appearance and personality[edit] she is short, squat, and curvaceous, with a large bust and a slender neck. she has a wide mouth, thick lips, and green eyes. she has black hair, although she reportedly has partial foreign ancestry and dyes her hair black to appear fully alethi. she wears dresses in the latest alethi fashions. towards the end of her life, after several stressful events, she takes on a gaunt, haggard appearance. ialai has been known to be underhanded since her youth. she is constantly assessing every person and situation, looking for weaknesses to exploit. jasnah kholin believes that ialai is as shrewd as torol, and the pair constantly scheme against their political rivals. ialai and torol are so self-serving and unprincipled that mraize believes them to be wholly unpredictable. attributes and abilities[edit] ialai runs the best network of spies and informants in the warcamps at the shattered plains, and is able to keep it a closely-guarded secret. her network also includes assassins. as the wife of a highprince, she regularly attends notable events in alethkar such as duels, feasts, and even military meetings, giving her personal access to a wide range of information and members of the nobility. she is generally a perfect alethi woman in public, but likes to lounge in private. she can write using women's script and is knowledgeable about wine. unlike most brightladies, she enjoys food typically served to men. her name is considered mildly blasphemous by the vorin church, which holds perfect symmetry holy. after torol's death, ialai continued to run a spy network in urithiru and then the shattered plains, even learning bits and pieces about the activities of the ghostbloods; she is among the few rosharans at the time that are aware of shadesmar and civilizations on other planets. she remains adept at seizing power when it is available for the taking. history[edit] ialai married highprince torol sadeas prior to the unification of alethkar and immediately became involved in alethi politics. at a feast in 1143, ialai tried to persuade dalinar to enter into a political marriage with evi, despite her assessment of evi as ""vapid"". after dalinar and evi were married, ialai and navani often tried to convince evi to be more assertive. as the wives of two influential highprinces who were often away in battle, ialai and navani often worked together in kholinar during this time in order to maintain a stable kingdom. gavilar had no issues leveraging ialai's schemes to eliminate political rivals. ialai was also present when torol won a king's boon from gavilar and subsequently defeated yenev in a duel. the shattered plains[edit] during the war of reckoning, ialai lived in the sadeas warcamp on the shattered plains. when shallan davar arrived to the warcamps with news of jasnah's presumed death, ialai haughtily asked her about the succession in jah keved. ialai and torol spent much of their time on the shattered plains conspiring against the other highprinces and currying elhokar's favor while simultaneously defying the authority of the throne. dalinar had become a longtime rival of torol's, and he and his son adolin were often the target of their plots. they became uneasy when dalinar nearly executed a plan that would have allowed adolin to challenge torol to a duel, and they vowed to destroy dalinar by any means necessary. using her spy network, ialai uncovered navani's notes on dalinar's visions. she altered the notes in a way that was intended to defame dalinar and released them at a lighteyed feast. however, dalinar embraced the release of the visions and was able to maintain his credibility. an unsuccessful attempt was then made on dalinar's life when a carpenter in the sadeas's employ intentionally collapsed a bridge while dalinar was crossing it. ialai felt that she had failed when dalinar survived. the pair then considered a coup, but decided it was not necessary since dalinar would likely be killed during his assault on the parshendi. however, they did not anticipate aladar shifting his allegiance to dalinar's cause. the addition of aladar's army to the combined alethi forces during the battle of narak allowed dalinar to hold off the parshendi long enough to unlock the oathgate to urithiru. urithiru[edit] ""“did you know that after whitespines make a kill, they will eat, then hide near the carcass? i used to wonder at this behavior until i realized the kill will attract scavengers, and the whitespine is not picky. the ones that come to feast on its leavings become another meal themselves.”-ialai to adolin during his ""investigation"" of torol's murder"" ialai moved to urithiru after the battle of narak and the advent of the everstorm. torol was murdered a few days after their arrival to urithiru. ialai initially threatened to move back to the warcamps, although in reality she would not leave the seat of power. she was genuinely upset by torol's death, and believed that someone in the kholin army killed him; she lashed out at adolin when he asked her some questions about the murder. she was also angry at dalinar, although she did not think he was the killer. she enlisted meridas amaram to investigate torol's murder. amaram was not able to discover that adolin was the culprit. during this time, the ghostbloods revealed that they were actively watching ialai. mraize personally posed as a sadeas soldier in order to get closer to her. he believed that she was exceptionally unpredictable since she would always approach any situation with her own motives ahead of all others. after torol's death, ialai was no longer openly adversarial with dalinar, which worried him since it meant she was likely undermining him behind his back instead. she named amaram the new highprince of house sadeas, in an affront to dalinar's authority. she attended the meeting of monarchs when dalinar was trying to unite roshar, defying tradition by refusing to carry her own chair. she tried to sabotage the kholin's efforts by suggesting an invasion of shinovar and insulting queen fen. at a later meeting of the remaining coalition, she and ruthar verbally sparred with jasnah, indirectly causing dalinar to have a revelation that the voidbringers were likely to attack thaylen city instead of jah keved. amaram and the sadeas army joined odium's forces during the battle of thaylen field, but were ultimately defeated by the knights radiant and their allies. amaram was killed, and ialai left urithiru in disgrace. return to the shattered plains and death[edit] after amaram's death, ialai returned to the warcamps at the shattered plains; mraize did not accompany her there. soon after her arrival, thanadal was assassinated and vamah fled, leaving her in control of the local economy. she also became the leader of the sons of honor, learning some secrets that she had not previously been privy to. however, due to the loss of both gavilar and amaram, there was little she could do to help them recover their previous influence. she retained some followers who referred to her as the true queen of alethkar, but the group operated more like a cult. still, dalinar had some concerns about letting ialai operate unchecked with an oathgate nearby. the other alethi assumed that ialai was also behind thanadal's death. shallan was sent to infiltrate ialai's group, using her powers to disguise herself as a merchant named chanasha. she was eventually able to trick ialai's followers into taking her through a secret tunnel to a fortress near the former sadeas lumberyards where ialai was living. she was sleeping in a small closet-like room and refused to leave the fortress. ""“i've fought so long. and now i’m alone … sometimes it seems the very shadows work against me.”-ialai, to a disguised shallan"" a noticeably frail and paranoid ialai assumed shallan to be a ghostblood agent, offering her wine and engaging in some wordplay. ialai revealed that thanadal and vamah had been assassinated by the ghostbloods despite their attempts to negotiate and flee. although ialai was angry with jasnah and dalinar, she had no designs on being queen herself, believing gavinor to be the rightful alethi monarch. she feared assassination and decided to bunker down hoping to be left alone. she believed that the ghostbloods were eliminating the sons of honor due to their knowledge of the gods on roshar and possibly beyond. shallan's three personas were conflicted; although veil wanted to kill ialai, radiant did not agree. even when shallan summoned a shardblade, ialai seemed ready to accept death. as she was apprehended, ialai suddenly died of poisoning; evidence pointed to foul play, but officially she was said to have killed herself. before she died, ialai gave shallan a clue to search her quarters; shallan then discovered her notes, in which ialai recorded numerous attempts to contact restares. she also displayed some limited knowledge of shadesmar and other planets in the cosmere, along with some theories about thaidakar and ba-ado-mishram. ialai's death confused shallan, and she assumed that a spy among her team, possibly another ghostblood, had killed her. her attempts to find the spy were fruitless, and radiant later admitted that she had taken over shallan's psyche and administered the poison in an attempt to protect shallan's mental health. shallan subsequently regained her memories of killing ialai. relationships[edit] torol sadeas[edit] torol was intrigued by ialai's blasphemous name when he first met her. it is likely that she and torol were very young when they were married; at a feast around the year 1143 when torol was approximately twenty years old, he and ialai were already husband and wife. he notes that she has never been considered a beauty and is not aging particularly gracefully, but he has always been attracted to her ""dangerous"" personality. the couple often fondly scratch each other's backs. ialai and torol are like-minded and regularly share information about the politics, personalities, and happenings of alethkar. they collaborate on schemes to increase their personal wealth and influence, typically with little regard for the welfare of others. ialai was distraught when torol was murdered. kholin family[edit] dalinar[edit] ialai and dalinar seemed to have a cordial relationship in their youth, during gavilar's unification war. ialai served as a matchmaker of sorts for dalinar's political marriage to evi and she even joked with dalinar on occasion. however, the sadeas's thirst for power eventually turned them against dalinar. this led to them plotting against him and eventually becoming outright enemies; they attempted to defame and even assassinate him. after torol was killed, ialai redoubled her efforts to plot against dalinar. she did not believe that dalinar killed torol, but she defied his authority and sabotaged his coalition. she continued to undermine him at every opportunity. evi[edit] ialai did not have a good first impression of evi, calling her ""vapid"". she and navani counseled evi to be more assertive during her marriage to dalinar. evi thought ialai was clever and admired her wit. navani[edit] although ialai had worked closely with navani in their youth to further their common goals, any vestiges of friendship seemed to be gone by the time navani got together with dalinar. adolin[edit] ialai did not think highly of adolin, and he was sometimes targeted by her schemes to get at dalinar. she seemed suspicious of adolin after torol's death. jasnah[edit] ialai and jasnah dislike each other, but ialai knows better than to verbally spar with her. she does not acknowledge jasnah as the legitimate queen of alethkar. mraize[edit] after the battle of narak, mraize and the ghostbloods keep a close eye on ialai because of her unpredictable nature. mraize infiltrated her inner circle through unknown means and was present for some of her important meetings in urithiru. mraize did not accompany ialai back to the shattered plains after she left urithiru in disgrace. ialai apparently realized mraize's true nature at some point, and subsequently lived in fear of the ghostbloods until her death. trivia[edit] - brandon noted that the rise and fall of ialai's mini-empire when she returned to the shattered plains could have been a major thread in a stormlight archive novel, but by the time it occurred in the overall story arc, he wanted to move on from the earlier group of antagonists that ialai represented (and whom had already been defeated). ialai's story had the potential for exciting political intrigue, but it did not fit into the narrative of an expanding war epic. notes[edit]"
Salinor Eved,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Salinor_Eved,"brightlord salinor eved is a shardbearer from the princedom of thanadal on roshar. attributes and abilities[edit] salinor is a duelist who fights in flamestance. he has a shardblade, but no shardplate. while salinor is skilled, he often boasts that he is a better duelist than the rankings show. history[edit] adolin and his father dalinar hoped to embarrass torol sadeas and the others in his faction by gaining all of their shards through duels. adolin's friend jakamav suggested salinor as a target, due to his boasting about his skill. in order to get salinor to agree to the duel, adolin had to wager both his blade and his plate for salinor's blade alone, a proposal that demeaned adolin. when adolin and salinor fought in their duel, salinor borrowed a set of the king's plate. adolin abandoned his traditional windstance to fight in ironstance in a brutal display of strength and skill. while adolin broke tradition in his conduct during the duel, he did not violate any rules, so highlady istow was forced to award the victory to adolin. salinor initially refused to give up his blade, but after adolin threatened him, he broke the bond and gave it to adolin. adolin bestowed the blade upon his brother, renarin kholin, so that he could have a complete set of shards. notes[edit]"
Resi,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Resi,"brightlord resi is a shardbearer from thanadal princedom in alethkar on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] he is lighteyed and his shardplate is painted yellow. he is referred to as thanadal's ""star"" shardbearer, and becomes quite frustrated when he loses a duel. attributes and abilities[edit] he holds the title of royal defender, a traditional post entitling the bearer to a full set of highprince thanadal's shards. the royal defender is the only full shardbearer in thanadal's warcamp. he is a competent duelist. history[edit] in 1173, adolin challenged resi to a ""friendly"" duel after thanadal had criticized dalinar. despite the seemingly low stakes, the dueling arena was full of spectators due to the political implications of the bout. resi favored stonestance, but his relatively slow movements left him open to adolin's counterattacks using windstance. adolin increased the pressure on resi, forcing him to take a defensive posture. resi became unnerved by adolin's rapid blows, and attempted another heavy strike, but adolin blocked it with his vambrace and destroyed resi's thigh plate, leaving him immobile and ending the duel. resi could be heard swearing audibly after losing. resi was one of the many shardbearers that guarded a meeting of the highprinces after the assassin in white's attempt on dalinar's life. notes[edit]"
Ishar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ishar,"""“i… have seen ishar. he curses me at night, even as he names himself a god. he seeks death. his own. perhaps that of every man. ”-the stormfather"" ishar, also known as ishi'elin, tashi, and tezim, is one of the ten heralds of the almighty on roshar. he's known as the herald of luck, and serves as the patron of the order of bondsmiths. in the present times, he rules over the country of tukar under the guise of its god-priest. he is the current bearer of his own honorblade. appearance and personality[edit] ""“none are radiant but him. his fury is ignited by your pitiful claims, and your unlawful capture of his holy city is an act of rebellion, depravity, and wickedness. ”-ishar, writing as tezim"" ishar is a strong-looking man with the look of a warrior, outfitted in robes and wearing an ardent's beard. rosharan artwork typically presents him as looking much older than other heralds, with a full beard and grey hair. modern rosharans would consider him to look shin, suggesting he's pale-skinned and lacks the epicanthic folds common to most people on the planet. he is known to be incredibly charismatic, capable of swaying entire nations to follow him, as well as to convince the other heralds of his opinions and his sanity. he also seems to be scholarly, and deeply interested in the inner working of the oathpact and the mechanics surrounding it. in addition, ishar is an excellent duelist, easily defeating five windrunners of the third ideal with minimal use of surgebinding. the stormfather notes that among the heralds he was only average in skill, though he was not a warrior at the beginning of the oathpact. in the present day ishar, like other heralds, is insane. his particular brand of madness seems to reflect his nature as a spiritual leader. he alternately believes himself to be above all other men, and hates who he is and wishes to die. the latter does not stop him from presenting himself as the ultimate authority and demanding utter respect as the god-priest of tukar. ishar tells dalinar that his insanity could be temporarily cured by a radiant swearing an ideal near him. this megalomania and charisma together make for a highly dangerous combination, as even now the other heralds hold ishar in particularly high esteem. nale claims that ishar has always been the wisest of them all, and shalash believes that he would know how to cure taln's madness. additionally, shalash presents him as a confident, eager man; energetic, and more of a battlefield commander than a wise scholar. he is bold rather than crafty, a man who pulled others after him on seemingly crazed ideas that ended up working. attributes and abilities[edit] herald of the almighty[edit] as a herald, ishar is immortal. when he dies, he travels to braize and can return to roshar, though at the cost of triggering a desolation. he wields an honorblade, having retrieved it from the shin after abandoning it at the aharietiam. it grants him surgebinding of the bondsmiths, namely the surges of adhesion and tension. ishar has mastered his fighting skills throughout the ages, and is capable of fighting multiple shardbearers with ease. he is capable of summoning honor's perpendicularity, draining stormlight from radiants by bonding them to the earth and even stealing away a radiant bond. the stormfather implies that without honor to restrict him, the extent of his abilities is unknown. binder of gods[edit] ""“but take care; ishar’s skill as a duelist is a lesser danger. he has recovered his honorblade. he is a bondsmith unchained. ”-the stormfather to dalinar"" unlike other heralds, ishar is sometimes described as having powers even before he became known as a herald, although whether this means he had them before becoming a herald is uncertain. his particular powers are seemingly tied to the cosmere-wide phenomenon of connection. he is often described as the founder of the oathpact, and is believed to have been the founder of the knights radiant, forcing them to organize and adopt precepts to live by, likely to prevent another ashyn-like catastrophe. even among the other heralds, the radiants were sometimes known as ""ishar's knights"". perhaps due to his abilities, he appears to have been the heralds' expert on connection and bonds. he studied the oathpact, and was the one who realized that one herald was enough to keep it working. he also sought a way to preserve information between the desolations, and in the present day, convinced nale to hunt down budding surgebinders, claiming it would prevent a new invasion. when he was visited by dalinar after the end of the emuli campaign, in his duel against five windrunners, he used his powers to connect them to the ground, causing their stormlight to drain away. he also demonstrated the ability to steal dalinar's bond with the stormfather, against both dalinar's and the stormfather's wills, as well as take dalinar's connection as odium's opponent in the contest of champions, although neither taking was completed. god-priest tezim[edit] ""“tezim the great, last and first man, herald of heralds and bearer of the oathpact. his grandness, immortality, and power be praised. ”-ishar's letter to dalinar"" in the current era, ishar acts as the leader of tukar, calling himself the god-priest tezim. the tukari are zealously religious, and indeed seem to believe him to be a god. for the past six years, they've been at war with the neighboring emul over the port city of sesemalex dar, in the conflict known as eighty's war. ishar's reasons for leading the tukari on sesemalex dar are unclear, though the two countries have always been embroiled in conflict. it's also uncertain how long ishar's been influencing tukari politics, though his official rise to power occurred somewhere around the start of eighty's war. as tezim, ishar refuses to participate in dalinar's alliance and demands that the alethi turn urithiru over to him. whether he has the power to back up his claim remains to be seen. history[edit] herald of the almighty[edit] ""“before he was herald of luck, they called him binder of gods. ”-the stormfather"" like most of the heralds, ishar was born prior to mankind's arrival on roshar, and was the first to be tricked by odium into experimenting with the surges that eventually forced the population of ashyn to flee to roshar. he was also the first human on ashyn to discover how to worldhop, enabling humanity to leave the planet when they needed to flee. when relations with the native rosharan singers broke down and the fused started to appear, ishar, along with nine other people, was raised to a herald by honor, creating the oathpact. ishar's part in the oathpact appears to have been larger than that of the other heralds, as he is called its founder. the oathpact demanded that to stop the desolations, the heralds had to travel to braize after each one ended. this led to them being tortured until at least one broke, sending them all -- and a desolation -- back to roshar. it was during one of those cycles that surgebinders began appearing. ishar was instrumental in transforming this scattered group into the knights radiant, although what precisely he used, other than threats of death and destruction upon those who wouldn't obey, is unknown. during that time, he also sought a way to preserve information between the desolations. eventually, however, the heralds had had enough of their endless torture. after a desolation in which only taln died in battle, ishar suggested that one person may be enough to keep the following desolations at bay. and so, the nine agreed to abandon the oathpact, leaving taln to suffer alone for over four and a half thousand years. post-aharietiam[edit] ""“tashi doesn't care much for what you do here. in fact, i’d pray that he doesn’t reach your city, as i doubt you’d like the consequences. ”-nale"" ishar's activities after the aharietiam are largely unknown. at some point, he met with nale and convinced him to hunt down and destroy all nascent surgebinders, believing that the return of the knights radiant would unleash a new desolation. during that time, he also insinuated himself into the politics of tukar and became its leader, the god-priest, under the assumed identity of tezim. as tezim, he waged eighty's war against emul. after the true desolation began, dalinar contacted tukar, hoping for it to join the fledgling alliance. ishar refused, and instead demanded ownership of urithiru and fealty from the newly refounded knights radiant. he was denied. shortly after, nale visited him again, hoping to gain more understanding as to why the everstorm still happened, despite his efforts. what they talked about is unknown, but nale later decided to abandon mankind and side with the singers. during the coalition of monarchs' campaign in emul, dalinar had a crew of windrunners fly himself, szeth, and nightblood to ishar's camp in an attempt to learn more about his own bondsmith abilities. while still in the air, dalinar noted that he already had a connection to the herald, allowing him to identify him on sight. ishar accused dalinar of being odium's champion, and refused his pleas for aid, though he did acknowledge that his ""lies"" were reasonable. he summoned his own honorblade, which he claimed to have received from szeth's father before he thanked ishar for letting him die. ishar attacked dalinar, easily defeating the five windrunners. as dalinar opened a perpendicularity, ishar approached him and created a connection with dalinar, meaning to steal his bond with the stormfather as well as dalinar's connection to odium, in which he sensed odium's and dalinar's opposition to each other. at the last moment, szeth used nightblood to sever ishar's new connection and then collapse the perpendicularity, which ishar had been holding open against dalinar's will. nightblood was then able to chip a piece from ishar's honorblade. shocked by the damage to his blade, ishar opened his own perpendicularity, which the stormfather was unable to sense, and fled into shadesmar with his men. once ishar was gone, dalinar heard the herald's voice through the perpendicularity. sounding much more sane, he informed dalinar that he could be restored temporarily if a radiant swore an oath near him. ishar claimed to know a way of resetting the oathpact, and asked dalinar to meet him in shinovar, before reverting to madness. ishar had been experimenting on radiant spren, somehow bringing their cognitive forms into the physical realm and measuring how long they were able to survive-usually mere seconds-and then performing autopsies. the stormfather was extremely distraught at this revelation and called it an abomination. culture[edit] as one of the heralds, ishar is venerated throughout roshar. in the vorin tradition, he is known as ishi'elin, and associated with number 10 (ishi), the essence of sinew, and the divine attributes of pious and guiding. he is often listed alongside jezrien and kelek as one of the most important heralds. ""ishi be praised"" is a common phrase. however, unlike with most heralds, ishar's true name remained in use among the vorins, with places like ishar's field, and the curse of ""ishar's soul"". names such as ishal, ishnah and ishikk are likely derived from his. unlike in the east, where jezrien is placed as the most important, in the west ishar is often considered the leader of the heralds. in makabaki nations, he's called tashi, and is titled the god of gods and the binder of the world. the people of tashikk in particular -- which itself may be named after tashi -- place him as equal, though opposed to odium, or nun raylisi, and believe that as long as they stay in their homeland, tashi protects them from evil. in yeddaw, the tenth of the traditional ten pancakes of the weeping is dedicated to tashi, and is imagined rather than actually made. tashi's light orphanage is named after him, and ""tashi above"" is a commonly-used phrase. further west, in shinovar, he's known as ishu-son-god. quotes[edit] ""“a warning, from tezim the great, last and first man, herald of heralds and bearer of the oathpact. his grandness, immortality, and power be praised. lift up your heads and hear, men of the east, of your god’s proclamation. none are radiant but him. his fury is ignited by your pitiful claims, and your unlawful capture of his holy city is an act of rebellion, depravity, and wickedness. open your gates, men of the east, to his righteous soldiers and deliver unto him your spoils. renounce your foolish claims and swear yourselves to him. the judgment of the final storm has come to destroy all men, and only his path will lead to deliverance. he deigns to send you this single mandate, and will not speak it again. even this is far above what your carnal natures deserve. ”-ishar's reply to dalinar's request for a coalition."" trivia[edit] - ishar is featured as one of the - endpapers. - the phrase ""ishar's soul"" has so far only been used by - . - ishar's portrait used in the chapter arches is called the priest by the - staff. notes[edit]"
Rlain,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Shen,"""“did they know what it was like to be of an entirely different species? a species they were currently at war with-a species whose people had all been either murdered or corrupted? ”-rlain reflecting on the loneliness of his situation"" rlain is a listener and member of bridge four, as well as the second-ever enlightened truthwatcher. he is sent by the listeners to the warcamps to spy on the alethi and is given the name ""shen"" while running bridges with bridge four. he reveals himself after discovering that eshonai and the other listeners have transformed into stormform, and he later takes a place as a soldier in bridge four's new incarnation as a military unit. in recognition of his heroism during the occupation of urithiru, he is offered a bond by the mistspren tumi, who names him bridger of minds. appearance and personality[edit] ""“i have no interest in taking 'what i can get.’ ”-rlain"" appearance[edit] rlain has the marbling characteristic of singers; his skin and beard (when he has one) are a unique pattern of red and black, regardless of which form he takes. after bridge four is freed by dalinar, rlain gets the glyphs for ""freedom"" and ""bridge four"" tattooed on his forehead with the rest of the crew. this carries over to his other forms, blending into his skullplate in warform. while in dullform, rlain looks very much like a singer in slaveform (a ""parshman""): his face is round, plump, and hairless, and the parts of his body are generally thicker and stouter than those of humans. he is taller than the typical parshman, but not conspicuously so, and still short by alethi standards. dullform is characterized by low intelligence and low capacity, though rlain is on the higher end of this bell curve. he is capable enough at mental math to solve a problem that stumps his human overseer, responding before the man's wife can furnish an answer, though taking too long to register that he shouldn't have responded at all. despite the need to preserve his cover, he gradually chances riskier behavior with certain members of bridge four. he becomes secure enough to request seconds on stew from rock, and he eventually gathers the courage to ask kaladin if he is truly bridge four, and if so, why he isn't allowed to have a spear. when denied, he shakes kaladin to the core by asking if he is bridge four's slave. dullforms also have a harder time hearing the rhythms and rarely speak, a trait rlain exaggerates to better imitate a parshman. he largely communicates simple thoughts through physicality. on the rare occasions rlain does speak in this form, every word carries purpose and meaning. in warform, he becomes as tall as and more muscular than an alethi, and also gains an orange-red skullplate and armored carapace growing out of his body at the chest, thighs, and outer arms. he becomes able to think with normal intelligence, he displays a very soldierly attitude toward dalinar. from his earliest times taking warform, he displays unusual adeptness at resisting its inclinations to violence and taking risks, preferring a more cautious and pacifistic approach. he avoids engaging in physical violence in his resistance of odium’s forces, and it concerns him that he hears the rhythms more loudly in this form. personality[edit] like the rest of his people, he considers touching the bodies of his fallen kinsmen to be a major taboo, a holdover from the ancient days when humans hacked apart singer corpses, searching for gemhearts. in urithiru, he pretends not to notice humans' discomfort in his presence, and he habitually exaggerates his facial expressions and de-emphasizes the rhythms in his speech to put them at ease. sometime between the battle of thaylen field and the alethi campaign to emul, he takes workform in hopes of looking less like the enemy. however, workform's vague visual similarity to slaveform causes humans to treat him like a parshman, which he finds intolerable, so he returns to warform. he struggles with reductive stereotypes and discrimination in general, no matter how much he tried to change for others. he is fully aware of how people around him stare at him and fear him, to the extent of many simply making up stories about him to try to justify their prejudice. he is also aware of how people on both sides of the war distrust him. he has experienced various people trying to feel his carapace or look underneath it, and this leaves him very uncomfortable and irritated. he hates how he is seen as a symbol, a representation of his entire people, and wants to instead just be seen as a person. all of this makes him feel like an outsider, and he feels that as the war goes on, he is only becoming more and more of an outsider. he hates it when people use racial slurs to describe the singers and listeners, though he doesn't speak up for them or for himself, simply saying ""it's all right,"" when they apologize to him, as that is what they expect him to say. he sometimes accidently attunes the rhythm of irritation when he says it, betraying his true feelings on the matter. for a long time, he struggled with feelings of being a traitor to his people, not just to the listeners, but also to bridge four. over time, he grew to love himself more and get over these feelings. he wants to be recognized for his own abilities, enough so to turn down an honorspren that chose to bond with him due to being forced to. he was overjoyed upon tumi picking him of his own free will, based on being in awe of him for his actions and personal attributes. this can be seen as an extension of his general desire to be seen as who he is. he enjoys playing cards--particularly towers and runaround--and he's quite good, as his spy training and the listeners' cultural de-emphasis on facial expression make him excellent at bluffing. he is gay, exclusively being attracted to other men, he described this as not being what he was expecting. attributes and abilities[edit] as a singer, rlain can take on different physical forms by bonding with certain spren. he uses dullform for a time, which hampers his physical and mental abilities but allows him to hide among parshmen to infiltrate the alethi warcamps. he later changes to warform, gaining the ability to think normally, a much stronger body, and natural skill in combat. like all singers, rlain is asexual when in a non-procreative malen form, though he is surprised to discover the first times he takes mateform that he is exclusively attracted to men. he is trained in basic field medicine, like the other original members of bridge four. spycraft[edit] he is adept in spycraft, going undetected among the warcamps for three years. much of this skill is rooted in his ability to blend into anonymous groups and use his acting skills to make people think he is where he is supposed to be. however, his notoriety among the humans (and later the invading singers) of urithiru hamper his efforts. additionally, while warform singers are typically terrible at art, rlain has the skill to use soot or makeup to paint out his tattoo, integrating it into his pattern. from his long experience as a spy, he is accustomed to going unnoticed, and he finds the attention he garners from his unique situation in urithiru deeply uncomfortable. surgebinding[edit] after bonding an enlightened mistspren, rlain develops the same basic abilities as renarin kholin, including future-sight, although his deeper connection to the rhythms as a singer will likely affect his radiant abilities somewhat. history[edit] early life and the war of reckoning (1166-1173)[edit] ""“attuning joy, eshonai ran after him. together the three of them chased and dashed, climbed and soared-spanning chasms, climbing up and over rock formations, sprinting across plateaus. the shattered plains felt like a playground. ”-eshonai, thude, and rlain exulting in the return to warform"" it is not confirmed which of the ten families rlain belongs to, but given his early friendship with eshonai, which predated the reunification of the listeners at the beginning of the war of reckoning, it is likely he is of the first rhythms family. if so, he would have grown up in the forested wilds near the shattered plains, then conquered and inhabited one of the ten cities for two years, before the listeners retreated to narak en masse and the alethi claimed the cities to establish their warcamps. this knowledge of the warcamps likely would have aided in his later infiltration. rlain and his friend thude were among the early adopters of warform, though they returned to workform for a time in the years between its invention and the commencement of the war of reckoning, only taking warform again when alethi troops begin to arrive at the shattered plains. he was given the best spy training his people could offer, and he infiltrated the alethi about 2 1/2 years into the war, wearing dullform to masquerade as a parshman slave. in his three years as a spy, he worked in various warcamps, and his final owner before being sent to bridge four was a mid-dahn lighteyed overseer among sadeas’ quartermasters. but when the overseer called out an addition question to his wife and rlain thoughtlessly responded with the answer, the overseer feared his parshman was too intelligent to risk breeding, and he offered rlain up to the bridge crews. back home in narak, the listeners believed the humans had discovered rlain in the warcamps and executed him. bridge four (1173)[edit] ""“no. shen is one of us now. i don't care what he was before. i don't care what any of you were. we're bridge four. so is he. ”-kaladin accepting rlain (as shen) into bridge four"" rlain was placed in bridge four as an experiment by hashal to see if parshmen could be trusted to run bridges, since human bridgemen were becoming difficult to find. this fate was particularly devastating for rlain, as he knew his people had been ordered to fire on any parshmen bridgemen, should the humans ever start using them for runs. the archers could not distinguish his pattern from a distance, so he could only watch as his friends did their best to kill him. despite the horrors, he never broke character. most members of bridge four vociferously distrusted him from the beginning, suspecting that he would refuse to run against the parshendi or even turn on the other bridgemen. however, kaladin insisted that he was to be treated fairly and would not be used to soak up arrows in place of the human runners. when rlain didn't volunteer his name, kaladin dubbed him ""shen,"" which rlain later compared to naming a child ""human."" the other bridgemen grudgingly obeyed kaladin's orders, but continued to be suspicious. ""“he’s protective of the parshendi bodies, gancho. like he’d stab you a hundred times for moving one, sure.”-lopen"" teft in particular was inclined to worry about his loyalties, as rlain's addition to bridge four occurred in the middle of their secret plan to train in spear fighting and escape from the warcamps. even kaladin, despite his relative acceptance of rlain, didn't feel comfortable giving him a spear. instead, he assigned rlain and the other non-combatants (rock, lopen, and dabbid) to scavenge through the chasms with syl's aid while everyone else trained. rlain went on bridge runs and chasm duty several times without issue, just as kaladin had expected, even joining the other bridgemen standing at parade rest as sadeas' armies crossed the chasms. however, teft, and likely much of the crew, continued to distrust him. during one chasm duty session, kaladin began to scavenge from a listener corpse, and rlain's attempt to stop him prompted teft and moash to restrain him in a chokehold. curious, kaladin ordered him freed, and rlain gently but firmly pushed kaladin away and took up a defensive position over the corpse. rock and lopen reported that he had done similarly before during their scavenging efforts. ""“he was sitting on the rocks, distant, staring forward. kaladin approached with the others. the parshman looked up at him, face a mask of pain, tears streaking his cheeks. he looked at kaladin and shuddered visibly, turning away, closing his eyes.”-aftermath of kaladin's experiment with the parshendi armor"" rlain's passion inspired kaladin to harvest listener carapace and bones and fashion it into armor and a shield to draw the fire of the enemy archers from the other bridgemen. when kaladin put his plan into action, rlain became distraught to the point of tears and couldn't bear to look at kaladin. with matal's permission, rlain was left behind on subsequent runs, including the fateful battle of the tower. after being freed, rlain went with the rest of the bridgemen from sadeas's warcamp to dalinar's. by that time, he was relatively accepted by the rest of bridge four. when the tattooist who had given the rest of bridge four their markers of freedom refused to work on him, saying he was property, many of the bridgemen--teft at their lead--jumped in to defend his status as a free man and part of the squad. perhaps as a result of that incident, rlain started feeling more comfortable with the rest of the bridge crew and didn't tend to hide in the back of the group as much as before. rock was delighted when rlain began asking for second helpings of stew. ""“i think that i am not bridge four. i am bridge four's slave.”-rlain confronting kaladin about not receiving a spear"" kaladin still resisted the thought of arming a parshman, fearing it would not be tolerated by the lighteyes and threaten the status of all of bridge four. instead, he assigned rlain and dabbid to help lopen assist rock, helping with the supplies, the cooking, and the training of other cooks to feed the other squads of bridgemen-turned-soldiers, as well as other miscellaneous tasks for bridge four officers. eventually, after admiring the practice swords in the training area earlier in the day, rlain risked compromising his cover by pressing the issue, asking kaladin why he had not been given a spear like the others. he forced kaladin to confront the fact that despite the other bridge four members' claims of his equal standing, rlain was functionally still a slave. kaladin takes this like a punch to the gut, having heard perhaps a dozen words from the parshman in his time on the crew, but he rejected the request, explaining that the lighteyes barely accepted them already. ""“i’ve spent my life being judged for my eyes, shen. i won't do something similar to you because of your skin.”-kaladin empathizing with rlain"" after four more weeks of navigating lighteyed society, kaladin's conscience got the better of him, and he asked dalinar for permission to arm rlain and add him to the guard rotation. dalinar asked if kaladin trusted him, and upon kaladin's affirmation that he did, dalinar allowed it out of curiosity. kaladin apologized for being frightened before. reverently holding the spear, rlain told kaladin he is a good man, and he began to say more, but was interrupted by moash's arrival and declined to say more. rlain's first day as a guardsman, he was given basic spear training with natam and leyten, then later that day, he was part of renarin and dalinar’s guard when renarin’s ""thirty-two days, seek the center"" warning message was found. his second day, rlain was part of adolin's guard during the meeting with eshonai, rlain's former commander, out on the shattered plains. he noticed that something was very wrong with eshonai's voice--she had changed into stormform--and he left the warcamps that night to try to warn his people of the danger. on his way out, he notified kaladin that he was leaving, thanked kaladin for teaching him, and revealed his true name for the first time. the battle of narak (1173)[edit] ""“i have reason to believe that everyone i know . . . everyone i loved . . . has been destroyed, monsters left in their place. the listeners, the parshendi, may be no more. i have nothing left . . .”-rlain regarding the lost listeners"" rlain approached narak and observed the army of ten thousand stormforms that had been made out of the listener population. by then, thude had already escaped with the defectors, elderly, and children, explaining why rlain did not see any during his surveillance. rlain left them again, realizing that the change in eshonai had corrupted his people and effectively killed everyone he knew. he retook warform in his first opportunity, two weeks after his departure from the warcamps, and made his way back to the alethi armies shortly before the battle of narak, a few weeks after his departure. his warform appearance led to a tense standoff with the alethi troops, but rlain spotted skar among them, who vouched for his identity. rlain was peacefully taken into custody, though dalinar charges teleb and his personal guard with watching him, as dalinar worried about how defensive the bridgemen were of him. ""skar: ""you’re bridge four. "" rlain: ""i'm a traitor. "" rock: ""ha! is little problem. can be fixed. "" ―support during rlain's interrogation"" dalinar questioned rlain, wanting to find out more about his infiltration of the warcamps and the future plans of the listener army. although rlain didn't know anything about the army's specific plans, he described his fears around stormform and the return of their gods, the fused, ""the souls of those ancient, those who gave of themselves to destroy."" he agreed to help lead the army to narak as quickly as possible for the sake of any remaining listeners. he expressed a deep-seated resentment at the way parshmen were treated, and he was nearly overcome with grief at thoughts of the lost listeners, but was strengthened by firm orders from dalinar and affirmations of acceptance from rock and skar. after the interrogation, dalinar released rlain into the custody of bridge four. ""“you have to stop it, please. even if you have to kill them. do not let them finish that song.”-rlain's plea to dalinar"" leading up to the battle, he worked with shallan to draw maps and plan a route to narak across the plateaus. once the battle began and the stormform listeners started singing to summon the everstorm, he recognized the dangerous tone of the song, though he wasn't sure about its exact purpose, and urged dalinar to prevent it from being completed at all costs, even if it meant killing everyone he had ever loved. he continued to advise dalinar about the song and the battle, though he was kept under guard and did not participate in the fighting. dalinar pardoned rlain for being a spy for a people who no longer exist. after shallan activated the oathgate to transfer the army to urithiru, rlain was among the bridgemen who returned to narak and encountered kaladin after his fight against szeth. urithiru (1174)[edit] ""“how could rlain be so fond of these men, yet at the same time want to slap them? ”-rlain on his place in bridge four"" rlain stayed with bridge four as they moved into urithiru along with much of the alethi army. he continued training and working with them, but the gulf between him and the other soldiers persisted. when he was on duty and guarding dalinar, other kholin soldiers viewed him with active suspicion. most members of bridge four often forgot his presence and effectively ignored him, acculturated to treating parshmen as invisible. when they did acknowledge him, many made an effort to make him feel included and appreciated, but this warmth was too often spoiled by demonstrations of ignorance and unconscious prejudice, like yake and drehy expecting him to have insight into the enemy's plans, eth casually using slurs in his presence, and many feeling relief that rlain was unable to breathe in stormlight, imagining it might turn him into a monster. he was not given encouragement as the other bridgemen gained windrunner abilities, unlike the humans with the same problem, and he became envious the newcomers to bridge four who were quickly able to become squires and assimilate with the group. despite his frustrations, rlain appreciated that most of bridge four made an effort to extend kindness and understanding, and made it clear their affection for him was genuine. rock and renarin were particularly consistent in their outreach and their friendship. alongside those external problems, he continued to deal with his grief over the genocide of the listeners. after the mass transformation into stormform, the casualties from the war of reckoning, and the transformation of the survivors into hosts for the fused, rlain believed he was the last of his people, which weighed heavily on him. after one particularly difficult day, kaladin engaged rlain in conversation, inviting him to explain his feelings, so he and bridge four could help shoulder his burdens. rlain resolved to try. it is unknown what rlain was doing during the battle of thaylen field. he was not seen or referenced on page in the entire second half of oathbringer. over time, as bridge four became more synonymous with a windrunner division, rlain sought other ways of making himself useful, often assisting with projects for navani. he offered a singer's perceptions on the feeling of being near voidlight versus anti-voidlight, and he confirmed details about gavilar's interactions with eshonai the night of his assassination. six months prior to the events of rhythm of war, he found great purpose in taking the lead on navani's initiative to speed crop production. he entrusted human farmers with the listeners' secret of using stormlight and rhythmic drumming to draw lifespren and stimulate growth. however, despite this gift, most humans of urithiru still treated him with distrust, believing him a ""savage"" dalinar or kaladin had somehow ""tamed"" or making superstitious gestures around him. others saw him as a noble warrior and mystical representative of a lost people--ostensibly kinder, but equally stereotypical and reductive. rlain experimented with returning to workform, hoping to look less like the humans' enemy, but that made people treat him like a parshman, which he hated even more, so he returned to warform. occupation of urithiru (1175)[edit] ""“in the face of it all -- the frightened humans, the mistrusting regals, the occasionally awed ordinary singers -- he wished he could simply be rlain. he hated that to every one of them, he was some kind of representation of an entire people. he wanted to be seen as a person, not a symbol. ”-rlain on his struggle against reductive stereotypes"" rlain was initially overjoyed at the news kaladin had found him an honorspren, but upon learning yunfah had to be coerced into considering him, rlain refused, choosing to wait for a spren who would choose him for the honor he represented. his disappointment likely played a role in his decision not to join the rest of bridge four on the campaign in emul. with the other windrunners gone, he joined kaladin and teft for drinks at jez's duty. despite kaladin's change in rank, rlain still addressed him as ""sir,"" and when no server would take rlain's order, teft ordered for him. at teft's prompting, rlain explained his experience running bridges against his friends, and kaladin finally apologized for desecrating the bodies of fallen listeners. ""“i’m not going to join them, kal. i am a spy. that is my training--as best my kind could offer. i’ll find a way to help from the inside. remember that the first people odium destroyed when he returned were not human, but listener.”-rlain on his role in the occupation"" when odium's forces invaded and the sibling's defenses were inverted against the radiants, rlain reported that the rhythms were ""going crazy,"" and he heard new ones similar to those perceptable during an everstorm. he assisted kaladin in hauling the unconscious teft to the edgedancer clinic, then lirin's clinic, where they discovered the scope of the invasion. kaladin sent rlain to hide in the living quarters, but rlain recognized that urithiru faced an extended occupation, and his best chance at surviving and helping his friends was to hide amongst the enemy in the initial chaos and use his spycraft to try to help from the inside. he improvised a mixture of black ash and water to paint over his tattoo, merging it into his pattern, and assumed an air of purpose to grant him free movement throughout the tower. he considered several options of undermining the occupation, but all risked danger to innocents, so he settled with stealing the only existing complete set of maps of the tower. his attitude of resolve let him walk straight through a checkpoint with stolen property in tow, with a claim that he was sent on a search detail to collect any form of human writing. however, within a day, he was outed during another routine stop when he failed to identify which fused he served beneath. rlain claimed he’d been held by the humans against his will, but the invaders quickly determined he had stayed on his own volition, believing he wanted to continue being the radiants' slave. they labeled him an essai (""human-lover"") and jailed him in the cell that had formerly housed szeth. ""“he kept his head high -- he hadn’t lived through bridge four to be intimidated by a quiet room and staring eyes -- but he couldn’t help feeling like he was the one gemstone in the pile that didn’t glow. somehow, with the singers invading urithiru, he’d become more of an outsider.”-rlain's tension with the humans of urithiru"" mazish informed venli of rlain's imprisonment, which came as a great surprise, as she and the listeners had believed he'd been discovered and killed over a year prior. venli visited rlain the next day and spoke with him alone, though noting that they were being watched by a voidspren hidden in the body of a cremling--tumi, evaluating rlain's fitness for a bond. venli informed rlain of odium's eradication of all other surviving listeners, and revealed that while she'd recruited a dozen singers to guard the fallen radiants and spared the lives of several humans that turned out to be kaladin's family, she was not interested in allying with the humans in general. rlain urged venli to stop being selfish, free him, and join him in his defiance of odium. venli demanded raboniel release rlain to her custody, claiming he was precious to her as the last of her kin, and put him in the infirmary with lirin and hesina to care for the fallen radiants. over the next four days, rlain developed a close, comfortable relationship with kaladin's family, including a wry rapport with hesina and the curious affections of oroden. then pretending to be venli's servant, he retrieved the stolen maps and pored over them with venli and hesina, hoping they might be of use to kaladin. venli identified a tunnel complex she and her followers could use to escape. ""“i thought you should know something about me. i figured maybe if you did, you would stop making things up.”-rlain to the whispering women in the laundry room"" rlain continued to run errands for venli, including a trip to the laundry facility, where he was met with suspicion and harassment from human captives and singer guards alike. he confronted one man who characterized him as a gloating oppressor by asserting, ""i come from an entirely different country. i’m as much one of them as you are an iriali."" he countered a trio of gossiping women by telling them about his enjoyment of card games, hoping to silence their speculation with a little truth about himself, but they only used it as fodder for further speculation. the awakened singers viewed rlain with the same level of reductive stereotype as the humans. some saw him as a traitor and descendant of traitors, while others revered him, viewing the listeners as a brave frontrunner group who had prepared for odium's return. rlain returned to the infirmary, where he, hesina, and lirin continued to plot the next move in their resistance. while idly considering a map of the shattered plains, rlain noted the scout report that they later discovered is thude's settlement of escaped listeners. soon, dabbid appeared, hoping to recruit rlain's aid for a dying, comatose kaladin. this put rlain at odds with lirin, who feared what might happen to his remaining family if he openly defied the fused. fortunately, venli had a better solution. with rlain's help, she hatched a plot to free lift, and along the way, she gave rlain a highly edited version of the extermination of the remaining listeners, tailored to win rlain's sympathy. when lift was out, rlain apologized for calling her selfish, instead calling her a hero. they parted ways, and rlain ushered dabbid up the tower to meet lift and kaladin, easily talking his way past the patrol guards. lift healed and awakened kaladin and teft, though rlain chafed at her lackadaisical attitude, and they spent some time brainstorming the next phase in their resistance. rlain believed he could disguise himself and get to navani, to get her perspective on waking the radiants and escaping. ""“you know, all those months running bridges -- then training with kal and the others -- i wondered. i wondered deep down if i was a traitor. i now realize i didn’t have the first notes of understanding what it meant to be a traitor.”-rlain to venli"" when rlain went to inform lirin and hesina of the developments, he found venli weeping, and she revealed that thousands of listeners survived the coup, and--to rlain's increasing horror--gave him the raw truth of her role in events. he warned her not to try to seek out the other listeners, as she would be playing into raboniel's hands. when the sibling woke kaladin and beseeched him to send them rlain, kaladin believed they were urging him to put his plan in motion. rlain and dabbid approached as water carriers, but a guard recognizes rlain, and the two were intercepted to clear their presence near the queen with a superior. upon reaching the atrium and discovering a civil war in progress, the guards flee, leaving rlain and dabbid, who established a triage to organize care for the wounded. then they discovered teft's body, and rlain mourned him with the song of the fallen, a listener song for honoring fallen heroes. ""“you all, you know me. i’m bridge four. i know you don’t like me, but are you willing to trust me?”-rlain unites humans and leshwi's forces with his teft impersonation"" rlain channeled his inner teft and found the sense of authority to organize the humans and leshwi's traitorous heavenly ones behind a common purpose, moving the injured and the unconscious radiants to safety. he used his status as an outsider to gain an air of neutrality, and offered leshwi the two surviving listeners' guidance on escaping odium's control. he was rankled to discover venli had bonded a spren, but he sublimated his frustration in the face of more pressing priorities. he gave the humans the opportunity to flee or retrieve their families, then they all made their way toward the exit, only to be surrounded by enemy fused. he and leshwi resolved to fight, and he asked venli if she knows of any other spren willing to bond singers. venli explained that she sent the other lightspren away for their protection, then--confused--reports that timbre says rlain is spoken for. tumi sent rlain a vision of kaladin in gleaming radiant plate and the tower coming alight and urged him to speak the first oath. ""“keep fighting. salvation will be, rlain, listener. bridger of minds. i have been sent to you by my mother, at the request of renarin, son of thorns. i have watched you and seen your worthiness. speak the words, and do not despair.”-tumi's first words to rlain"" he found deep satisfaction in the knowledge he was chosen for his actions and his personal qualities, and that his spren was ""awed by him"" and honored to bond him, as opposed to yunfah having to be coerced and the sibling wanting him solely because of his species. in the aftermath, he befriended dul, mazish, and venli's other singer recruits, and accompanied them to narak via oathgate, where they united with leshwi and her defecting heavenly ones. rlain invited them to stay in narak and join the war against odium, but leshwi had little interest in fighting her own kind, and resolved to find ""a third option, outside this war. the path of the listeners."" kaladin relayed navani's promise to offer refuge should they need it, which they greatly appreciated. rlain reminded venli to write him by spanreed once she found the others, and to give his best to thude and harvo, if they survived. he promised to come to them soon, though he first needed to speak to renarin. rlain also worried he needed to be present in the event humans attempted to repeat the past and defeat the singers by taking their minds. venli and her group set off toward the eastern flats, where the listener survivors had been spotted, and kaladin and rlain returned to the tower for teft's funeral. relationships[edit] kaladin[edit] ""kaladin: ""scavenge from the parshendi. teft, you’ll probably have to hold shen the whole time. i can’t have him trying to stop us. and men, be respectful of the dead. "" leyten: ""they’re parshendi! "" kaladin: ""i know. but it bothers shen. he’s one of us, so let’s keep his irritation to a minimum. "" ―chasm duty"" as rlain's bridgeleader within bridge four, kaladin readily accepts him into the crew, names him ""shen,"" and refuses to allow the other bridgemen to mistreat him. however, kaladin maintains some private reservations, refusing to arm him or train him in the spear. in the desperate days in sadeas' crews, kaladin is also forced to prioritize his people's lives over rlain's wellbeing, and he creates armor from listener carapace and bones for himself, and then the entire bridge crew of 27, despite knowing how it will distress rlain. rlain continues to serve under kaladin after the bridge crews are transformed into a military unit for the kholin army. kaladin defends rlain's right to a bridge four tattoo and its signifiers of freedom, but he persists in his reluctance to allow him a spear, to rlain's deep disappointment. this gnaws at kaladin's conscience, as in his experience, he had not tolerated being a well-treated slave. weeks later, kaladin eventually overcomes his reservations and presents a spear to rlain, and rlain often describes him as a good man from then on. when rlain's feelings of isolation and loss are particularly acute, kaladin is one of the rare people to step up and make a concerted effort to understand what he is going through. ""“kaladin was a good man. for all his faults, he tried even more than the rest of them.”-rlain appreciating kaladin's efforts to listen"" though kaladin still struggles to overcome deep-seated biases, including thinking ""shen"" looks like an evil spren from stories when sitting in the shadows and feeling discomfort at seeing warform rlain giving humans orders as they implement his system to accelerate crop growth, kaladin makes a concerted effort to listen to him, trust his judgment, and see him for who he is. this determination is put to the test when odium's forces invaded urithiru, and rlain elects to fight the resistance from within, rather than remain hidden at kaladin's recommendation. however, kaladin gives rlain his trust. renarin[edit] ""“rlain sipped his drink and wished renarin were here; the quiet, lighteyed man usually made a point of speaking with rlain. the others jabbered excitedly, but didn’t think to include him. parshmen were invisible to them -- they’d been brought up that way. ”-rlain's musings while watching the others train"" months after renarin joins bridge four, he still feels like an oddity among their number. he voices these insecurities to rock, who helps him realize that rlain feels the same way, but to a far greater extent, often isolated within their number due to his nature and history. from then on, renarin makes a special point of sitting and talking with him frequently, being a friend to him, and making him feel like one of their number in truth. rlain greatly appreciates this and misses renarin when he is not around. in the weeks that follow, rlain became fiercely defensive of his friend, and when kaladin encourages the others to be tolerant of renarin's choice to learn to read, rlain reiterates to himself his appreciation for kaladin's attempts at understanding. ""“she creates in us a faction loved by neither men nor odium. no home. no allies. she might be destroyed by either. we will need more. like you and like me. together.”-glys, on the liminal status of enlightened radiants"" eventually, when sja-anat asks renarin for any potential candidates for bonds, renarin immediately suggests rlain. with that vote of confidence, the enlightened mistspren tumi, sent to evaluate mraize for a bond, also spends several weeks observing rlain's heroic qualities during the occupation of urithiru, though he must be careful to avoid coming to odium's attention. in the chaos of the uprising, in recognition of rlain enjoining the humans and singers in shared purpose, tumi names rlain bridger of minds, rejects mraize, and bonds him, making him the second-ever enlightened truthwatcher. rlain wishes to seek out the surviving listeners with venli, leshwi, and their people, but he establishes that he needs to stay, at least until renarin returns. rlain and renarin share the capacity for future sight through their sprens' connections with sja-anat, and rlain's abilities are likely to hew close to renarin's, though there may be some variance due to his species and connection to the rhythms. renarin develops romantic feelings towards rlain, and it is possible rlain returns these feelings. sanderson explains that the characters have not yet reached the same conclusions that their emotions have. he wrote scenes further developing renarin's and rlain's chemistry in rhythm of war, but removed them for pacing reasons. other members of bridge four[edit] ""“people in the tower watched him with outright hatred. his friends didn’t, but they sure did like to pat themselves on the back for that fact. ”-rlain on bridge four's inadvertent prejudice"" when ""shen"" is first assigned to bridge four, he is met with immediate suspicion and hostility. most want to send him to the deadliest position in the front of the bridge, with skar, teft, and moash being most firmly in favor. however, kaladin demands he be given equal treatment, and the other bridgemen eventually fall in line. gradually, they become accustomed to rlain's presence, and he comes to be more or less accepted as a member of bridge four. despite his second class status among the bridgemen, rlain's bond with the crew is so profound that when freed, rlain makes the commitment to get a forehead tattoo. when the tattooist objects, the others rally behind him, insisting he has been freed like the rest of them and threatening not to pay her if she doesn't comply. ""“they often seemed surprised to find him there, as if they'd forgotten he was around. but when teft did notice him, the man's smile was genuine. they were his friends.”-rlain"" however, bridge four's support proves to be inconsistent. most can be relied upon to defend him from threats outside bridge four, but many fall short at making him feel included among themselves, both as ""shen"" and as himself. he is rarely noticed, as rlain rationalizes that the other bridgemen were brought up to consider parshmen invisible. none voice any objections when someone mounts several sets of carapace armor on the wall of their kholin warcamp barracks, despite knowing how much they distress shen, but when his true identity is revealed, skar, rock, and others are quick to vouch for him and defend him from nervous kholin troops. bridge four is so protective of their fellow bridgeman that dalinar puts teleb's men in charge of guarding him, for fear they cannot be impartial. their advocacy helps him earn a pardon from dalinar. ""“but for all their faults, they had succeeded in giving him a home. because they’d been willing to try to see him for himself.”-rlain on his bridge four family"" further, he is treated very differently from bridge four's human members, due to biases they had difficulty shaking. when only he, skar, and dabbid are unable to draw in stormlight after weeks of practice, the other bridgemen encourage skar to keep trying, but say nothing to rlain, fearing that use of stormlight will cause him to become a monster, despite his explanations that he would have to voluntarily choose to do so. some conflate him with the fused and assume that he can understand the enemy's motivations, forcing rlain to remind them that the fused are more the listeners' enemies than theirs. however, despite feeling invisible and something of an outsider to bridge four, rlain still views its members as his family and understands that they mean well. rock[edit] as non-combatants, rock, dabbid, and lopen spend the most time with ""shen"" as they gather salvage during chasm duty under sadeas, then the team becomes rock's assistants under dalinar. rock is consistently kind to rlain, from delighting when his assistant musters the nerve to request seconds on stew, to encouraging renarin to recognize the ways rlain relates to his experience of being ostracized. teft[edit] rlain’s relationship with teft is one of great extremes. when rlain first joins bridge four, teft is not shy about voicing his suspicions that the parshman could spoil or sabotage their plans to escape. later, when rlain tries to stop kaladin from scavenging from a listener corpse, teft grabs rlain in a choke hold to protect his bridge leader, and kaladin orders teft and moash to restrain him while the bodies are looted for valuables. teft repeatedly advocates putting shen in the deathline at the front of the bridge to absorb enemy arrows. this attitude changes around the time kaladin wears listener carapace into battle, and teft sees rlain's immediate reaction and his very relatable emotional agony. he advises kaladin that rlain may not be good for bridge runs any more. when the bridgemen are liberated from sadeas' crews, teft is the first of many to speak up for shen, defending his right to get his tattoos of freedom like the rest of bridge four. like most of the other bridgemen socialized not to notice parshmen, teft often overlooks rlain, though he offers him genuine smiles when he acknowledges his presence, and rlain considers teft a friend. later, when teft, kaladin, and rlain meet at a winehouse after the rest of bridge four departs for emul, teft is far more attentive to rlain's needs. he notices the listener's difficulty flagging down a server and orders rlain's drink for him, then asks rlain about his experience running bridges against his own people. ""“he bowed his head for teft, then left him there. let the dead rest. it was their way, and he wished to be able to give the man a proper sky burial. teft had been a good person. one of the best.”-rlain mourns teft"" when teft is knocked unconscious by raboniel's inversion of the sibling's defenses, rlain is deeply concerned, and assists kaladin in getting him help. when teft wakes weeks later, rlain's joy at seeing teft restored is a great source of strength for the older man. they plan their next course of action, then part ways to put it into effect, and the next time rlain encounters teft, he is dead, murdered by moash. while only a year and a half before, teft forcibly prevents rlain from showing respect to a listener corpse, here rlain mourns him as a hero, singing the song of the fallen, and wishing he could give the man a proper sky burial. he and dabbid draw anguishspren. in a timely tribute, rlain channels his best teft impersonation to unite the humans and the rebellious singers in defense of the radiants. dabbid[edit] rlain is very protective of dabbid. during their time as the only two members of bridge four who haven't gained radiant abilities, they are often set to work together. rlain is greatly relieved to discover dabbid is safe, and feels hurt when he discovers dabbid can talk, claiming ""bridge four doesn't lie to one another."" ironic, given rlain's months hiding the truth of his identity. dalinar[edit] ""“amazingly, he seemed to want to obey -- as if he needed something to lend him strength. ”-dalinar on rlain after his return to the alethi"" dalinar and rlain do not have a close personal relationship, but dalinar is the one who makes the choice to allow rlain to be armed, and rlain considers dalinar to be his military commander, since he sees himself very much as part of bridge four and, by extension, the kholin army. when rlain returns to the alethi and surrenders himself to dalinar, he demonstrates full obedience to him and even finds strength in following his orders. in turn, dalinar, though he remains wary of rlain and keeps him under guard for some time, vows to help the listeners as much as possible and follows rlain's advice during the battle of narak. dalinar pardons rlain after the battle, and rlain is allowed to move around normally in urithiru on his duties with bridge four, which include guarding dalinar. trivia[edit] - rlain is entirely absent from the second half of - , which may appear to be an error but is in fact intentional and significant. - though feeling an outcast, rlain was considered for four different bonds in rhythm of war: the honorspren - (encouraged by kaladin), the sibling (suggested by navani), one of venli's lightspren (though timbre reports rlain is ""spoken for""), and finally, the enlightened mistspren tumi (recommended by renarin). - in a delightful bit of foreshadowing, the nickname ""shen"" makes more sense as a shortening of ""parshendi"" (the listeners, his true identity) than ""parshman"" (his disguise). notes[edit]"
Polestone,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Gemstone,"the polestones are the ten varieties of gemstone that naturally hold light. they also serve as the basis of spheres, the basic rosharan money system. attributes[edit] composition[edit] some polestones are the same type of crystal but with different color and chemical signatures. sapphire and ruby are both types of corundum. smokestone and amethyst are both types of quartz. emerald and heliodor are both types of beryl. much like how iron and steel, despite being very similar chemically, are different metals in the metallic arts, the exact color and chemical signatures are enough to differentiate the polestones. as a result, an off-color polestone acts much like an impure alloy in allomancy. if a polestone was drained of its color by an awakener, it would still hold stormlight but would have the properties of a dusty or cloudy quartz. if a spren was trapped inside, they would be released. if sung to, while holding light, polestones will break. light and surgebinding[edit] all lights can be stored in gems. how long a given quantity of light will remain in a specific gem depends on the type of light and the quality of the gem. the rate at which a light leaks from gemstones is not constant either - it appears slow at first, but accelerates rapidly near the end, making gems that begin to dim, dim fast. regardless of the type of light, perfect gems are said to be able to hold it indefinitely, but they are extremely rare. although the type of polestone stormlight is stored in is irrelevant for most surgebinding, polestones do have an important impact on soulcasting. namely, they determine what kind of substances a soulcaster can transmute objects into. it is believed to be impossible to create polestones via soulcasting. spren[edit] in addition to the ability to hold stormlight, polestones are able to trap spren. the type of spren that can be trapped depends on the polestone used and its cut. this quality serves as the basis for fabrials. each polestone is associated with one of the ten essences and with an order of knights radiant. however, there appears to be no functional difference between polestones apart from soulcasting and fabrial creation. if a polestone is set in the pommel of a deceased shardblade it allows the blade to be bonded, whereby it can be summoned and dismissed. synthetic versions of the polestones could also be used in fabrials. the ten polestones[edit] sapphire[edit] sapphire is associated with the essence of zephyr. they are used to soulcast translucent gases, like air. sapphire spheres are given the ""sky-"" prefix. it is associated with the order of windrunners smokestone[edit] smokestone is associated with the essence of vapor. they are used to soulcast opaque gases, like smoke and fog. smokestones are used in a type of fabrial clock. it is associated with the order of skybreakers. smokestone is a chemically impure version of quartz.[fn 1] ruby[edit] ruby is associated with the essence of spark. they are used to soulcast fire. rubies are used in the production of conjoiner fabrials, where a single infused ruby is split in two. once activated the two halves will mirror each others movements, lift one and the other will also rise. spanreeds are a common application of this phenomenon. rubies are also used in a kind of heat producing fabrial. they are also used in the construction of a painrial, a pain reducing fabrial, designed by longshadow and adapted by navani kholin. a ruby was also part of the oathgate at the center of the shattered plains. ruby spheres are given the ""fire-"" prefix. it is associated with the order of dustbringers diamond[edit] diamond is associated with the essence of lucentia. they are used to soulcast crystals, like quartz and glass. diamonds are used in a kind of light producing fabrial. diamond spheres are given the ""clear-"" prefix. it is associated with the order of edgedancers emerald[edit] emerald is associated with the essence of pulp. they are used to soulcast plant material, like wood, moss, and grain. emeralds can be used to capture flamespren. they can be found in chasmfiends. it is associated with the order of truthwatchers garnet[edit] garnet is associated with the essence of blood. they are used to soulcast the eight types of blood and all other non-oil liquids. garnets are used in a type of water attracting fabrial. garnet spheres are given the ""blood-"" prefix. it is associated with the order of lightweavers zircon[edit] zircon is associated with the essence of tallow. they are used to soulcast oils. it is associated with the order of elsecallers amethyst[edit] amethyst is associated with the essence of foil. they are used to soulcast metals. amethysts are used in the production of reverser fabrials, where a single infused amethyst is split in two. once activated the two halves will inversely mirror each other's movements, lift one and the other will be lowered. it is associated with the order of willshapers topaz[edit] topaz is associated with the essence of talus. they are used to soulcast rock and stone. a topaz was observed as part of a fabrial replicating regrowth, an application of the surge of progression. it is associated with the order of stonewards heliodor[edit] heliodor is associated with the essence of sinew. they are used to soulcast animal material, like meat and flesh. heliodors are used in the production of alerter fabrials. these fabrials can be used to detect a variety of stimuli, such as people and emotions, and give notice to its user. the larger the heliodor, and as a result the more stormlight that can be infused in it, the wider the fabrial's range is. a heliodor was observed as part of a fabrial replicating regrowth, an application of the surge of progression. it is associated with the order of bondsmiths they can be found in gumfrems. obtaining[edit] while polestones are produced via mining, a significant source of them on roshar is the harvesting of the gemhearts that grow inside greatshells. larger species of greatshell, like chasmfiends, produce gemhearts of great size, which are incredibly useful in soulcasting as a larger stone is less likely to break from the strain. this trait however has led to many species of greatshells, such as the lanceryn, to go extinct. the exact method by which gemhearts are grown is not understood, though it is known to be caused by a leak from the spiritual realm into the physical, and is analogous, though not identical, to the production of atium in the pits of hathsin on scadrial. although they may have flaws, gemheart polestones have virtually no impurities, unlike their conventionally mined counterparts. perfect gemstones[edit] perfect gemstones occur when one of the polestones forms without any flaws or imperfections which allows them to hold light indefinitely. the money exchangers living in major cities of shadesmar use perfect stones to store the stormlight they use for currency. the king's drop is a perfect gemstone that has been held in the thaylen gemstone reserve for over two hundred years without being renewed or losing stormlight. in addition to not leaking, a perfect gemstone can hold far more stormlight than a normal gemstone of the same size could. the elsecallers were tasked with protecting perfect gems, including a ruby named honor's drop. the honorspren have gathered many perfect gemstones in their stronghold lasting integrity. jasnah kholin believes that there are far fewer perfect gemstones around in the physical realm than there should be, suggesting that someone may have been gathering them up before their value was more widely known; possibly the ghostbloods as they are experimenting with transporting stormlight off-world. perfect gemstones have the capacity to hold cognitive shadows in addition to spren, the latter of which they have a far larger capacity than normal gemstones--they can hold heralds, the unmade, and even fused. they could also capture some of the dor or the sunlight from taldain. transfer[edit] it is possible to transfer light from a filled, small gemstone to a large and empty gemstone of its type by holding the filled gemstone to the empty one. this method of transfer is slow and inefficient; however, the thaylens have discovered a more efficient way of transferring stormlight from one gemstone to another. by using a tuning fork of a specific frequency, a person can touch an infused gemstone and then touch the fork to the empty gemstone for a rapid mode of transfer. with the thaylen method, the type of polestone does not matter, and light can be transferred from any type to any type. the decay rate is unknown, as is the distance the tuning fork can be brought before transfer is impossible. surgebinders are also able to infuse polestones regardless of the type, and can do so very quickly. roshar economy[edit] gemstones form the basis for the roshar economy. gemstone weight is measured in kivs. when used as currency, the gems are encased in glass spheres. although the spheres are of uniform size, the gemstones inside are of three sizes. in descending order of size (and value), these gem sizes are broam, mark, and chip. in addition, the value of the “sphere” is determined by the type of gemstone, which have different values as determined by their utility rather than their rarity.. their relative value in descending order is as follows: emerald, sapphire, ruby, diamond, and garnet. in addition, amethyst is one of the more valuable gemstones; topaz and zircon are amongst the least valuable. notes[edit]"
Wan ShaiLu,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Shaizan,"wan shailu, known as shai, is a maipon woman from sel. she has a reputation throughout the rose empire as being one of the best forgers alive. she was imprisoned in her homeland, but escapes after restoring ashravan's health. she becomes a worldhopper and leaves sel, and is unable to return. appearance and personality[edit] shai is small of stature like the rest of the maipon people. she has black hair that lays straight and long. she wears spectacles because of her bad eyesight. she is implied to have epicanthic folds, and has prominent cheekbones. her arms are layered with shallow cuts from the bloodsealer weedfingers, who needs her blood to keep her imprisoned. her voice is on the deeper end for a woman, and she uses the expression ""nights!"" as a curse word. she loves the thrill, the accomplishment and the wonder of forgery. however, at times, she is tempted by a simple life where she doesn't have to hide or lie. she constantly quotes her uncle won and aunt sol although they don't really exist. they are figments of her imagination created for one of her essence marks. she believes her forgeries are works of art and she gets angry when contradicted on that. she worships the unknown god. she holds a deep hatred for autonomy, and by extension bavadin, due to her ideals and actions. this hatred is enough that it can sometimes cloud her judgement. elantrian[edit] as an elantrian, she has a very high opinion of herself, seeing herself as a divinity worthy of praise and offerings. in this form, she has the glowing skin of an elantrian and wears her hair up in a bun. attributes and abilities[edit] shai is a very talented artist, but generally uses her ability to make forgeries of paintings. she reads people very well and is a master manipulator. she has good control of her emotions. she is very knowledgeable in art history and has a very good understanding of realmatic theory. shai is one of the best forgers ever to live, especially in soul forgery. flesh forgery is one of the few branches of forgery she hasn't studied in depth because getting a flesh forgery wrong usually means the subject dying. essence marks[edit] during her time on sel, shai has five essence marks which took her over eight years to create. as of her time on scadrial, she has created at least one more. in the decades to centuries between her escape from the rose empire, and her work against the set alongside marasi, she gained a lot of skill in her use of essence marks. she is now able to create essence marks that last far longer than the mere day that her old ones last for, enough so that she believes they could be potentially permanent, even without hemerine reapplication. therefore bypassing, through unknown means, the limitations posed by the shifting identity of sentient beings. these are not necessarily permanent, and might wear off some day. universal stamps[edit] shai carries two soulstamps that are designed to work on any object for a limited time. one creates a doorway, and the other repairs broken objects. this is still limited by the feasibility of a forgery, to a degree. if a forgery with a universal stamp is completely infeasible, the stamp would not properly take. history[edit] shai first started inquiring about being a forger when she was eight years old. han shuxen, an old painter who had tutored shai as a child, asked her to destroy his masterpiece lily of the spring pond. shuxen hated the rose empire and didn't want his painting, which he had painted for a woman he once loved, in their hands. he helped shai create a counterfeit. shai managed to destroy the original painting in the arbiter frava's office near the imperial gallery, replaced it with a fake and planted another lower-quality counterfeit in her room in order to hide the theft. with the help of the imperial fool, she also broke into the rose palace's imperial gallery by impersonating a noblewoman to steal the moon scepter. however the fool betrayed her. he stole shai's copy of the moon scepter, swapped it for the original, then escaped after giving shai up to the palace guards. shai was captured and charged with public execution for theft. the emperor's soul[edit] a day before her execution, she is asked by the council of five arbiters to forge a soul in exchange for her freedom. shai doesn't think it is possible to create a soulstamp for an entire person's soul in the hundred days they give her at first, but accepts their offer in the hope that it will give her time to escape. she is taken before the emperor ashravan and told that he took a crossbow bolt in the head from the assassins sent by the glory faction and despite surgeons resealing the wound, he is in a vegetative state. she is told to replace the emperor's soul with a forgery. she is given a room barely better than a cell which, over time, she transforms into the finest room in the whole palace with forgery. she receives her forgery tools except for her essence marks. gaotona volunteers to being her test subject for the soulstamps she creates for emperor ashravan. the arbiters hire a bloodsealer to make sure of her cooperation. as they work together, gaotona and shai grow fond of each other and eventually become friends. shai starts to collect information on ashravan's personality and memory to use for the soulstamp. shai concluded that the arbiters were planning to kill her, even if she fulfills their agreement, a little while before the soulstamp is done and have another forger finish her work. she started lacing her notes with subtext about the arduousness of the task to deter the other forger. all the arbiters except gaotona proposed that she create a backdoor to the emperor's soul that would allow him to be controlled by the arbiters. shai played along but eventually refrained from doing it, even for herself. as her hundred days pass, shai was constantly tempted to escape but was driven by the challenge of the task. on day ninety-seven, just before she finishes the soulstamp, she enacts her plan to get past the bloodsealer. the next day, captain zu tries to kill her, a move she had expected from some of the guards and managed to evade by forging traps into her room. she escaped and made her way to ashravan's chambers, desperate to see if she had managed to forge a soul from nothing. when it succeeds, gaotona gave her back her essence marks and she used them to escape the palace. it later turns out that she didn't reforge ashravan's soul exactly the way it was and made small changes, nudging him on the path to being a better ruler. after she escapes, shai plans to track down the imperial fool who betrayed her, a task she eventually succeeds at. resistance against trell[edit] at some point after her release from the rose empire, she became a member of the ghostbloods and worked on scadrial in order to resist the oncoming threat of trell, working under the codename of moonlight. six years after the first interaction between the elendel basin and the southern scadrians, she found marasi colms in a series of underground caverns, crashing a set smuggling operation. she secretly gave her a letter, informing her that the ghostbloods were watching her and were impressed by her accomplishments. several days later, she met with marasi, acting as her driver for a sting operation on the set smuggling operation in bilming. introducing herself as a member of the ghostbloods using the code name moonlight, she explained to marasi the nature of trell and autonomy. shai assisted marasi, wax, and wayne in their investigation and pursuit of the set until being discovered by telsin, then an avatar of autonomy. when the group separated, shai was tricked by marasi into bringing her back to the ghostblood hideout in bilming, which marasi believed may have been her intention regardless. shai introduced marasi to the small crew of scadrian ghostbloods-including to kelsier, via seon-who believed that shai had taken on marasi as her apprentice. with some research, shai, the ghostbloods, and marasi discovered an entrance to the set's underground caverns. she took twinsoul with them to infiltrate the complex, and-at kelsier's request-three large jars of purified dor, which shai looked upon with awe. she was forced to use a stamp to change her past and turn herself into an elantrian, also changing her personality and giving her the abilities of an elantrian. she used aondor in order to create an illusion of marasi, letting her escape. following this, she vanished and the ghostbloods sent out a mission to look for her. relationships[edit] bavadin[edit] she holds a deep hatred for bavadin, fundamentally disagreeing with her ideals and actions. they have met before at an unknown point. kelsier[edit] kelsier is her mentor, and she holds a deep respect for him.[expand] marasi[edit] she has a great interest in marasi, and was the one who brought her into the ghostblood's fold. prasanva[edit] she works with prasanva in bilming. she is willing to try to help him get back to his homeworld, but he rejects her offer, stating that it is too dangerous.[expand] gaotona[edit] gaotona held a strong dislike for shai, seeing her forgery as an abomination, and felt that she was wasting her immense talent. but over time, she managed to change his view on art, and make him grow a fondness for her, making him wish to save her from execution, even if he didn't feel as if he was on her side.[expand] hoid[edit] she despises hoid for deceiving her and running away with the moon scepter, replacing it with her forgery. after escaping from the rose empire, she began to hunt after him to enact her revenge, an act that she eventually succeeded at. their current relationship is unclear, but she does wonder to herself if she was keeping watch over him, or he over her, but she knows that they are in reality just keeping watch over the same third parties. kaise[edit] she works with kaise in bilming.[expand] trivia[edit] - in one of - deleted scenes, - visits her in prison and discusses the - she stole and how

Kholinar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ringington_market,"kholinar is the capital city of the kholin princedom and of alethkar, roshar. it's roughly symmetrical in shape, built around enormous stone formations known as the windblades for their unmistakable shape. it is the place where talenel, herald of the almighty, announced to the world that the desolation had come. geography[edit] kholinar is located in northern alethkar. the city is built near the windrunner river. kholinar is sheltered from highstorms by huge rock formations called windblades. it has many gardens and is considered beautiful in part because of the windblades that jut up in and around the city.[citation needed] history[edit] kholinar is one of the dawncities, the most ancient sites on all of roshar. as the silver kingdoms emerged kholinar became alethela’s capital and an fabrial was built in the city. it was the home of king nohadon during one of the desolations. through the ages, it was rebuilt several times. following sunmaker's death, it fell into the hands of one of his sons, the progenitor of house kholin.[citation needed] during gavilar and dalinar kholin's war of alethi unification, it was conquered by the two brothers and subsequently became the capital city of alethkar. near the end of the war of reckoning, aesudan's negligence and pai's accusations caused the city to erupt in riots. the kholinar wall guard managed to restore order to the city and exiled all parshmen beyond its limits before the first everstorm arrived. soon afterward, the fused gathered the transformed parshmen and began the siege of kholinar. with high numbers of refugees coming in from the entire princedom and silence from the palace, the city quickly became overwhelmed, with various services collapsing and gangs roaming the city. the chief forces within kholinar at the time were the wall guard and the cult of moments. in addition, the city was under the influence of two unmade, ashertmarn - who influenced the cult of moments and caused the breakdown of the lighteye structures in the city, and sja-anat, who corrupted the various spren.[citation needed] while the city's defenses and command structure had all but collapsed, the wall guard had taken up its defense under the command of highmarshal azure. however, they were focused almost exclusively on the external threats. in the city, spren reacted strongly to any use of stormlight, including spanreeds and soulcasters. this, along with the threat of fused attacks, made outside communication impossible, and soulcasting was only made possible by metal plates provided by wit, seemingly made of aluminum, that prevented detection. the guard's single soulcaster was able to keep them and much of the city fed.[citation needed] when the strike team, along with azure, attempt to retake the oathgate, a thunderclast breached the walls and the voidbringers broke into the city. while the team managed to reach the oathgates, they were unable to activate it properly, and kholinar was overrun.[citation needed] this was the first time in modern history kholinar had fallen to an invading force. under the control of voidbringers, tens of thousands of humans were moved out of the city to work on farms, while singers were moved in. the voidbringers also began taking apart the palace.[citation needed] landmarks[edit] windblades[edit] the most notable feature of kholinar are the windblades. they are massive rock formations, akin to giant fins, sticking out of the ground. they appear to be made of red, white, and orange strata, highly similar to the walls of urithiru. over the centuries, tunnels have been cut into them for quick and discrete passage through the walls. the windblades are wide enough for people to live atop some of them. the city wall[edit] the wall surrounds the entire city. it incorporates the windblades for much of its length, with man-made structures in the spaces between them. it is sixty feet tall at its highest point and ten feet wide, with guard posts every three hundred feet. each post is large enough to hold a platoon of soldiers.[citation needed] the kholinar palace[edit] the kholinar palace consists of the main palace complex, a garden, and the monastery dais, which is connected to the main building by a passage known as the sunwalk. the palace is situated in the northern portion of the city, on a plateau high above the rest of the building. this caused a set of unloading docks to be built at the bottom, to transport cargo to and from the palace. the kholinar oathgate[edit] the original function of the kholinar oathgate has been lost to time. in the modern day, it is known as the monastery dais and serves as the headquarters of the kholin ardentia. buildings have been built on the oathgate platform, including chapels and housing, although the original chamber, with its eleven lanterns and a keyhole, remains unchanged. the oathgate is currently non-functional, as odium forced sja-anat to corrupt its spren.[citation needed] the impossible falls[edit] the impossible falls are waterfalls located in a small park in the south-west portion of the city. it appears to be a private meeting place. it is said that when viewed from the correct angle, the water seems to flow down tiers and then back up to the top. adolin kholin describes them to shallan davar, telling her he would like to show them to her in person one day. the lanacin monument[edit] a monument in the southwestern part of the city. little is known about this monument, but it is likely related to lanacin the surefooted. sunmaker park[edit] a park in the northern part of the city that is named after the sunmaker. little is known about the park. ringington market[edit] the ringington market is the market closest to yokska's shop. district of colors[edit] a section of kholinar under the fused occupation, potentially existing before then. nearby, quarried rock is being taken to build houses for the makay-im. known street names[edit] - moonlight way - talan way politics[edit] royal family[edit] alethkar’s royal family resides in kholinar, but with the war of reckoning the only known members to reside here are aesudan and gavinor. as the king and queen normally reside here, kholinar is the center of alethi politics and the residence of the royal court.[citation needed] wall guard[edit] the kholinar wall guard was tasked with patrolling the city wall and controlling gate access, but was crippled when most of the high ranking lighteyes disappeared into the palace after the execution of an ardent and the subsequent riots. with no high-ranking lighteyes to take charge, a woman calling herself highmarshal azure seized control of the guard and organized them to defend the city. with ithi and her sister using the single remaining soulcaster in a room lined with aluminum provided by wit, highmarshal azure was able to keep the wall guard fed and provide a sizeable amount of food for the common people of kholinar.[citation needed] they recruited any able-bodied fighter, using food and redemption to entice volunteers. their primary focus was defending the wall from fused raids, letting the city run itself for the most part. they used extra food to stop the other highlords from trying to seize control of the walls.[citation needed] kaladin was able to convince high marshal azure to lead six hundred of the wall guard to assault the palace.[citation needed] city guard[edit] the city guard is the main peacekeeping force in the city. during the riots after the execution of pai, the remaining city guard was recalled to the palace. like other people who entered, most of them never returned, leaving behind only the personal forces of the highlords.[citation needed] elhokar and adolin were able to recruit about a hundred of the highlords and their personal guards to join on the assault.[citation needed] palace guard[edit] this was the force tasked with the protection of the royal family in the city and the palace. a portion of the guards resisted the lure of the unmade and were locked in a room within the palace complex. upon their release, they claimed time seemed to pass differently for them, feeling it has only been a few days rather than weeks since the riots.[citation needed] cult of moments[edit] the cult is a new arrival, as it either appeared or revealed itself upon the beginning of the siege. they are divided into two groups. one group roams the street imitating corrupted spren, while the rest of the members hold feasts on the monastery dias. ashertmarn, the heart of the revel, compels them to mindless hedonism. the cult takes new members easily, provided that they can bring them food. shallan is able to join the revelers on the oathgate platform by stealing and distributing it.[citation needed] religion[edit] kholinar is located in the vorin country of alethkar, making the majority of its population vorin. as capital of alethkar the city likely contains temples to each of the heralds. the queen is known to have many ardents in her retinue. multiple devotaries have a presence in the city. the known devotaries to have a presence here are:[citation needed] - the devotary of insight: they have a temple in kholinar. - the order of tanelenat: they have a presence in the western part of kholinar, adjacent to the temple of tanelenat. notable residents[edit] notes[edit]"
Rosharan card game,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rosharan_card_game,"a two-player, war-like card game exists on roshar and is played in alethkar. it is a game played by the singers khen and sah, as well as by some of their previous masters. kaladin has also played it. sah's set of wooden, lacquered cards is of herdazian make. cheaper, less durable cards are available, although they warp in the rain. rules[edit] cards can be played from the barrack, an area that functions similarly to a player's hand in many card games. while in play, cards can be captured and they can capture other cards, although the specifics depend upon the ranks of the cards involved. squires, for example, cannot capture unless supported by an allied card. on the other end of the spectrum, kings can capture any card except another king, and can only be captured by three cards working together, all of rank knight or higher. however, if a king is captured, the player it belongs to loses the game. this makes the decision to play the king a strategic one, since the great power in capturing is balanced by the risk of losing it. many actions require the cards involved to be touching each other. notes[edit]"

Istow,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Istow,"brightlady istow is a lighteyed alethi woman on the shattered plains of roshar. she serves as a highjudge, officiating duels. appearance and personality[edit] she is tall and has graying hair. she strictly enforces the dueling codes, and sometimes maintains an imperious attitude. she prefers that duelists use classic, beautiful stances, and is not immune to reacting emotionally if a combatant uses unseemly (but technically legal) tactics. attributes and abilities[edit] she is likely the ranking highjudge on the shattered plains, as she oversees most of the duels contested by the nobility. she and several other female judges record scores, keep the dueling rankings, and hold books of dueling code used in adjudicating disputes and determining the winner of the bout. as highjudge, her rule is law within the dueling arena with authority granted by the king; the king himself is the only person that can overturn her decisions. she observes duels from a special stone dais overseeing the arena. she initiates bouts and can end them at her discretion if the duel becomes dangerous. history[edit] istow presided over many of adolin kholin's duels, including a friendly duel against resi and duels for shards against salinor and elit. she did not approve of adolin's brutal approach in his match against salinor or his boring tactics in his win over elit, but in both cases she was forced to admit that he had not broken any rules. disadvantaged duel[edit] istow also presided over the duel between adolin and the team of relis, elit, abrobadar and jakamav. istow was present when relis challenged adolin. when she asked adolin if he knew the exact terms of the duel and if he understood what he was doing. adolin dismissed her brusquely, so she made no attempt to explain that he had agreed to a full disadvantaged duel against a team, rather than a paired disadvantaged duel against two people. after the duel began, adolin realized that continuing a four-on-one fight was foolish, and tried to signal to istow to end the duel, but she seemed to purposefully ignore him. she also angrily denied dalinar when he called for her to end the duel after renarin also entered the arena, claiming that adolin had not surrendered and that her word was law. adolin theorized that istow may have accepted a bribe from sadeas's camp to allow the duel to continue despite the fact that he would likely be injured or killed. after kaladin joined the fight and helped turn the tide, istow confirmed abrobadar and elit's surrender, the latter with noticeable reluctance. she was disturbed by relis's bizarre reaction to ""hearing"" his shardblade, announcing his forfeit when he ran from the arena. she awarded the victory to adolin after jakamav surrendered and was present when he exercised his right of challenge. notes[edit]"
Stances,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Stonestance,"""“a stance is about more than just looking great on the battlefield. it’s about footing, center of balance, and control of the fight. ”-adolin, to shallan"" the ten shardblade stances are fighting styles used by shardbearers in vorin culture. they may also be used with conventional weapons. overview[edit] there are ten stances in all, each based on one of the ten essences. a stance describes a general fighting style and tactics, rather than specific sword movements. many shardbearers have preferred stances, though may switch to others in specific situations. the shape and length of a shardblade may affect this choice. other factors include the circumstances on the battlefield or the user's own personality and level of expertise. however, the best swordsmen are familiar with all stances in order to better anticipate and counter their opponent. the stances require a great deal of practice; even though kaladin has mastered fighting with a spear, he has some difficulty learning swordsmanship. apart from a purely practical standpoint, the stances are an important aspect of shardbearer culture. when adolin teaches shallan how to fight with a shardblade, he is insistent on proper use of the stances, and speaks to her at length about tradition and respect; for adolin, the stances are integral to proper reverence of the shardblade. an ancient knight radiant from one of dalinar's visions remarks that dalinar's stances are unfamiliar to her, so the stances have likely evolved over time. the stances[edit] windstance[edit] windstance uses sweeping, broad strokes that flow from one attack to the next. it is a two-handed stance with the body turned sideways, elbows bent and the tip pointed up and back over the head. the sweeps are majestic, and come from multiple sides. sometimes they are small, quick blows that are meant to unnerve their opponent; other times, the sweeps are wide. windstance is the best stance to use against multiple opponents and can cause many casualties on battle field with its wide sweeps; it is very poor at parrying, though it does have some defined sweeps for doing so. this is adolin kholin's favored stance and the most familiar one for dalinar as well. since it relies on mobility more than strength, adolin plans to teach it to shallan early on when he is teaching her swordfighting. it is very popular among the alethi in general. smokestance[edit] smokestance is a fluid, one-handed stance that has the blade forward, tip pointed at the heart of their opponent, and one foot placed ahead of the other. smokestance is better than windstance for fighting with an imperfect weapon. the key in this stance is to stay in motion at all times. while the blade may move in a whirlwind, it focuses on thrusts rather than sweeps and slashes. one variant of smokestance is a sword and dagger stance, which uses the dagger primarily as a second line of defense. flamestance[edit] flamestance is an aggressive, sometimes frantic one-handed stance. unlike other stances, the posture of flamestance involves squared-off feet. the blade is held in one hand, with the other hand resting on the blade. the stance is favored by those with shorter shardblades. it is defined by furious constant attacks, but is weak to disarming as a result of the one-handed grip. vinestance[edit] vinestance is a defensive stance that focuses on defensive footwork and flexibility. it is slow and steady, but has sudden, quick lunges. relis ruthar, the former alethi dueling champion, prefers this stance. bloodstance[edit] bloodstance is a stance in which the wielder doesn't care about getting hit, mostly used in desperate circumstances. ironstance[edit] ironstance is a strong stance with a two-handed grip, sword held next to the head, and uses strong overhead blows. stonestance[edit] stonestance is a form that relies on raw power. the stance involves holding the sword in front, arms fully extended, tip pointing straight up. on offense, the focus is on delivering as much momentum as possible in each blow; a characteristic strike, for example, involves jumping up, lifting the blade behind the head, and making a diagonal downward cut. when on defense, the stance relies on staying immobile and is one of the few that uses parrying. since it doesn't require much strength to cut most things with shardblades, this stance is largely impractical when not fighting a shardbearer. stonestance is considered the immovable stance and provides solid footing in combat. other stances[edit] there are three more stances, corresponding to the essences of tallow, lucentia and sinew; however, they have not as of yet been featured in the books. in addition, singers may use stances unfamiliar to humans. notes[edit]"
Tashi's Light Orphanage,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tashi%27s_Light_Orphanage,"tashi's light orphanage is an orange building on the corner of a street and an alleyway in yeddaw. the orphanage is run by a woman known as the stump. lift's experience[edit] lift goes to this orphanage to get some food, because she was running out of food to fuel her surgebinding. also, she was very hungry. she goes inside, and sees a boy who has some sort of mental disability get left there. she muses on the discrepancy between what people think of orphanages as and what they really are. she gets some food, an meets a man who asks her what part of the body she would be if the city were a person. suspected money laundering[edit] because stump is secretly a knight radiant and needs stormlight to fuel her powers, her spheres frequently go dun. as a result, she often trades them out for infused spheres of slightly lesser value, which leads to her being suspected of money laundering. reputation[edit] it is known by the urchins of yeddaw as a place run by a grumpy and mean woman, but also a place to get some food. notes[edit]"

Wayfarer,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Wayfarer,"wayfarer is an underground city beneath bilming within the elendel basin on scadrial. it was originally crafted by the set in order to house the community. the inhabitants of wayfarer were told that the outside world had grown inhospitable following the eruption of the ashmounts, this however was a lie devised by the set to try and control the local population. in total the operation had lasted five years before the citizens realized the truth, with the assistance of constable marasi colms. as part of the effort to control the citizenship all metal was removed from the town. although originally intended to only serve for the community project the town was later modified by gave entrone and telsin ladrian to serve as a bunker for loyalists of the set in the event that autonomy decided to begin their invasion of scadrial using their men of gold and red. notable citizens[edit] notes[edit]"

Aviar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Aviar,"""“the world is changing, sixth of the dusk. the people of the mainland grow hungry for aviar companions; things once restricted to the very wealthy are within the reach of ordinary people. we've learned so much, yet the aviar are still an enigma. ”-vathi"" aviar are birds that have gained magical powers, or ""talents"", on the island of patji on first of the sun. they are capable of sharing their powers with humans. aviar were long thought to be exclusively native to the pantheon archipelago, but other birds can become aviar if they visit the island and ingest the fruit of patji's fingers. appearance and anatomy[edit] most aviar are relatively large birds, approximately three fists tall. some species may be smaller or larger. their appearance varies between species, with colors including red, green, black, blue, and white, sometimes in combination. some aviar have sharp raptor-like talons and beaks. juvenile aviar are barely able to fly, but healthy adults are typically good fliers unless their wings are clipped. behavior[edit] aviar are more intelligent than ordinary animals. wild aviar exhibit behaviors similar to other birds. they live in flocks, roost in trees, and build nests where they lay eggs and raise their young. their mating behavior somehow involves long single feathers known as ""mating plumes"", which are usually found near nests. although their powers give them some protection from predators, they will quickly flee if startled. they are known to eat fresh fruit, and will also eat seeds, dried fruit, and fish. they display distinct personalities; for example, kokerlii is oblivious and happy, while sak is far more reserved. they seem to understand some human speech, as they can respond to commands or other sounds from their master. they can be trained to perform specific behaviors, such as returning to their master if they whistle, or even to attack other animals. nature of abilities[edit] juvenile birds can gain magical powers, or ""talents"", by consuming special worms that live on the island of patji. aviar from the various islands of the pantheon migrate to patji to gain their talent. the worms infest fruit that falls from patji's finger trees that grow next to patji's eye; the birds then consume the worms when they eat the fruit. birds that are not native to the pantheon usually do not develop these unique powers. however, sixth of the dusk raised a non-native bird on the isles, sak, and found that she also developed a unique talent. ""“the aviar are special. everyone knows the separate breeds and what they do. why assume that a fish would learn to breathe air, if raised on land? why assume a non-aviar would become one if raised on patji...”-vathi, after learning of sak's talent"" the abilities of the aviar stem from a symbiosis with the worms that they eat. the worms are invested; once eaten, the worms grant the birds access to certain magical powers depending on their species. the aviar can then serve as an intermediary to allow humans to use or benefit from their powers. aviar do not seem to have to continue eating worms to allow their powers to function, as they are often exported from the pantheon to the distant mainland. trappers have established that the birds must be juveniles to gain talents; it is not clear what would happen if an adult bird ate the worms. aviar can be transported to other planets in the cosmere, although this is difficult and very rare. it is unclear if taking aviar to other worlds has an effect on their abilities. however, individuals that are not native to first of the sun are able to bond aviar, even individuals that have access to other manifestations of investiture such as feruchemy. a human cannot eat the worms or an aviar in order to gain powers, as the symbiosis is specific to the worms and the birds. it would be theoretically possible for other organisms to evolve a similar symbiosis, but it would take many generations. a kandra in the form of an aviar would not be able to gain their powers, even if they ate the worms. it is possible to steal an aviar talent through hemalurgy, but it would be very difficult to do so. abilities[edit] the power obtained by aviar is different for each species of bird. many aviar have abilities related to the cognitive realm, but spiritual and even physical powers also exist. some abilities work passively, while others must be intentionally activated by the aviar, sometimes at the request of a bonded person. at least one unknown aviar ability could assist with ""navigation"". aviar abilities are usually very reliable, although they were disrupted by an unusual device that was given to the northern interests trading company by the ones above. bonds[edit] aviar are able to share their powers with humans through a spiritual connection similar to the nahel bond. this bond is not as powerful as the nahel bond, but because of that it can be shifted between people at its owner's will. the bond includes a mental connection; dusk refers to sak ""sending"" him her visions. aviar are also able to sense the location of the person they have bonded with. the nature of the bond allows some aviar to share their talents with people other than their usual master. most people bond a single aviar, but some trappers have bonded at least three aviar at the same time. cognitive concealment[edit] ""“it was fortunate [kokerlii's] breed was so mind-invisible, even deathants would consider him no more edible than a piece of bark. ”-dusk"" kokerlii and mirris have a cognitive ability to conceal their mental activity and those of others around them. this ability seems to work passively, as dusk never needs to ask kokerlii to use it or wait for him to do so. some version of this ability appears to be relatively common, as flocks of wild aviar are able to conceal themselves from mind-sensing predators such as nightmaws. krell are known to sleep near aviar roosts in order to take advantage of the mental shield that they provide. additionally, aviar cognitive concealment impedes the ability of others to sense the use of investiture, much like an allomantic coppercloud. they would be able to block an awakener's life sense and interfere with other methods of detecting investiture, such as allomantic bronze and secretspren. future sight[edit] sak's ability allows her to glimpse into the future, using the property of fortune to glimpse the spiritual realm. she is able to see potential deaths of a person, and manifest these potential deaths as visions of corpses wherever they could be killed. the corpses are only visible to those with whom sak chooses to share her talent. if the danger passes, the pertinent corpse will disappear. sak is able to turn this ability on or off at will. she is even able to show vathi the visions at dusk's request. sak, whose species is not native to the pantheon, is the only known aviar that has ever possessed this ability. other abilities[edit] aviar talents have some parallels to other manifestations of investiture in the cosmere. aviar exist in the same universe as other manifestations of investiture, so the powers that they provide share some characteristics with other magics such as allomancy and surgebinding. although known aviar powers are similar to allomantic copper and electrum, not every aviar talent has an allomantic counterpart, and vice versa. ecology[edit] many species of birds in the pantheon can become aviar; neither trappers nor scholars are immediately familiar with every species. each species is typically found on a specific island. they can be sent to live in the homeisles or the mainland without issue, but wild aviar are only found in the pantheon. domestication[edit] ""“an aviar raised around humans never quite fit back in among their own kind. the same could be said of a man raised around aviar. ”-dusk"" when aviar are raised by someone from birth, they form a bond with them and prefer to stay nearby, treating them as part of their flock. due to the incredibly dangerous conditions in the pantheon, highly trained outdoorsmen known as trappers are the only people that can survive in the islands and raise the birds. aviar that are raised by the same trapper usually get along. they often enjoy being scratched affectionately, and may show displeasure by lightly biting. they do well living in nesting boxes in safecamps; trappers can allow them to come and go freely with no concern that they will not return. trappers use aviar as their personal companions, and also breed and sell them as their trade. each trapper chooses a specific island to live on and becomes most familiar with the species that live on their chosen island. history[edit] aviar is presumably an eelakin term, and throughout first of the sun's history they were found only in the pantheon. the magical abilities and the various species of birds had been well documented by the people of first of the sun, and centuries passed without the discovery of a new type of aviar. the people who were most familiar with aviar were the trappers, who underwent extensive training in order to survive on the islands and had no qualms about killing each other when they got there. they were strongly bound by tradition, and had a reverence for the islands, particularly patji. trappers were notoriously reticent and stubborn, and detailed information about the aviar and their powers remained their secret. aviars feature in folkloric stories, such as that of linji, who attempted to sail around the world without one. at some point, several aviar were taken to other planets. during the true desolation on roshar, aviar were seen in the possession of mraize and gereh, both worldhoppers that were not from first of the sun. it is not clear how the aviar were taken off-world, as this was very difficult at the time. gereh's aviar was later cared for by lift. like other birds, aviar are referred to as ""chickens"" by most rosharans. on first of the sun, aviar had always been exported from the pantheon exclusively by trappers. mercantile companies long desired to find a way to set up operations on the islands so they could raise aviar and sell them. however, trappers refused to help them, and commercial expeditions to the islands failed due to deepwalkers and other dangerous animals. aviar therefore remained relatively rare in the homeisles and the mainland, since trappers could only provide a limited supply. after the arrival of the mysterious ones above, companies quickly developed new technologies such as warships with marine propulsion. this emboldened the northern interests trading company to undertake the patji expedition. ""“we can’t fight them. they’ll find an excuse, they’ll seize the aviar. it makes perfect sense. the aviar use the worms. we use the aviar. the ones above use us. it’s inevitable, isn’t it?”-vathi, on the ones above"" during the expedition, a scientist and explorer employed by the company named vathi befriended a trapper named sixth of the dusk and learned several facts about the islands and aviar that were previously unknown to the general public. notably, dusk told her about the fruit of patji's fingers that gave aviar their powers; vathi was able to deduce that sak became a new type of aviar despite her origins in the mainland. she was shocked by these revelations, which contradicted centuries of assumptions by the eelakin people. the company had several devices given to them by the ones above, including one that could detect aviar on the islands. when some of the company opened this device on patji, all of the aviar became agitated, and their powers were disrupted. dusk and vathi eventually realized that the ones above desired the aviar but were somehow prohibited from taking them from a less civilized culture. they were trying to furtively accelerate the industrial development of first of the sun in order to skirt these rules. dusk and vathi vowed to try and stop them. known varieties[edit] mirris is a member of a green and white species known as ""streamers"" that have cognitive concealment abilities. various other species with different types of plumage have been observed, but the names of their species are unknown. notable aviar[edit] trivia[edit] - is not an aviar. - a crow named - supposedly spoke to - , but brandon has not commented on whether she is a kandra, an aviar, or if she even exists. - aviar were presumably inspired by brandon's love of pet birds including macaws and cockatiels; he has owned birds since he was a child. - his birds can sometimes be seen on his youtube livestreams. notes[edit]"

Rod (Roshar),https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rod_(Roshar),"rod is a member of bridge four in the kholin army on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] he is one of lopen's many herdazian cousins. he is beefy, with thick arms. he does not speak much alethi, but still comes across as jovial. history[edit] rod and another cousin, huio, joined the bridge four crew after its relocation to the kholin warcamp. it is unclear if rod had been serving in another highprince's army before joining bridge four. he was presumably among the cousins that had some difficulty carrying a bridge on their first training run. he was killed by the parshendi during the battle of narak. although kaladin barely knew rod, he felt a responsibility to protect him. rod was one of the many people that kaladin remembered while he was attempting to say the fourth ideal of the windrunners. a significant portion of lopen, huio, and punio's stipends as radiants go to rod's family, in accordance with herdazian cultural norms of caring for poorer cousins. notes[edit]"
Kaves Kholin,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kaves_Kholin,"brightlord kaves kholin is a distant kholin relative that lives in kholinar during the era of solitude. during his time as a lesser lord in kholinar, kaves wielded only middling power. however, he had greater ambitions and often sought to increase his influence within the city, much to the annoyance of the royal members of his family. as such, there was little love lost between kaves and the main branch of house kholin. following the arrival of the true desolation and the besieging of kholinar by the voidbringers, kaves kholin, like many other lighteyes, sought an audience with queen aesudan, who had retreated into her palace and not been seen for some time. he came to the palace accompanied by several attendants, but was captured and executed on the queen's orders along with his retainers. his corpse, as well as those of his attendants, were placed in a wine cellar within the palace and allowed to rot and be scavenged by cremlings. the bodies were discovered by shallan davar during her attempt to infiltrate the palace. she brought this news back adolin and elhokar, who guessed one of the corpses likely belonged to kaves, but mourned little for his death. notes[edit]"
Fused,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Makay-im,"""“they are the spren of parshmen long dead. they are their kings, their lighteyes, their valiant soldiers from long, long ago. the process is not easy on them. some of these spren are mere forces now, animalistic, fragments of minds given power by odium. others are more… awake. each rebirth further injures their minds. they are reborn using the bodies of parshmen to become the fused.”-the stormfather"" the fused are the souls of ancient singers that are able to be reborn by possessing the bodies of living singers. they are considered to be higher in singer society than regals and common singers. they are surgebinders; however, unlike the knights radiant, there are only nine ""brands"" of them, rather than ten, and each brand has access to a single surge, with none accessing adhesion. nature[edit] these ancient singer shadows exist in a state very similar to spren, until they take over a singer body. this process requires a living singer to open themselves up to bonding a new spren during a highstorm or the everstorm, in the same way as they would to adopt a new form. the fused then chooses one of these willing, open singers; in a process that causes intense pain to the host, it then takes over the host's body. fused are able to exert some amount of will upon their forms, such as skin patterns persisting or growing carapace in individual patterns. the fused can be killed by conventional means, but they can use voidlight to heal. however, damaging their gemheart with a shardblade is instantly fatal. the fused can be permanently killed by being stabbed with a raysium dagger connected to a gem of anti-voidlight, provided there is enough anti-voidlight in the gemstone. if they are wounded by an insufficient amount of anti-voidlight to destroy them completely, they may still be wounded sufficiently that they will be reborn mad. they can also be permanently killed by nightblood. they can also be trapped in gemstones. fused are generally trapped in the rosharan system. in the past, fused couldn't be reborn when the heralds stayed on braize to uphold the oathpact. they could be reborn many times during each desolation and were again sealed away when the heralds returned to braize. to avoid this process of rebirth, humans fighting in past desolations once tried to imprison the fused rather than kill them; this did not work, as the fused are able to will their spirits out of their bodies and seek a new host. in the true desolation, the fused use the everstorm to great advantage. not only can they use the everstorm instead of a highstorm to possess new living singers, but when they do die, they can immediately return during the next everstorm if they can find a living singer willing to take on the burden. fused tend to awaken from their time in-between desolations in groups. due to their invested nature, the ancient ones that become the fused do not need to bond a spren to attain and maintain full sapience. however, during the seven thousand years of war, many fused have lost some or all of their sanity, much like the heralds. they are unable to die, and even the insane fused continue to be reborn. the rebirth process injures the minds of the fused. many fused who remain sane enough to function also behave erratically in some regards. examples of this include the pursuer, who is immensely obsessed with vengeance and raboniel, who wishes to end the war regardless of the victor. each brand of fused has their own particularities. hierarchy[edit] the fused have an extremely complex political and social hierarchy even though their actions are generally governed by odium. generally, they have hatred and contempt for humans and place common singers above them in status. among common singers, those chosen to be elevated are granted forms of power and become regals. the fused tend to defer to thunderclasts and unmade. however, even within the singers there are delineations of status and authority. there are nine brands of fused with different powers and specialties. other factors such as reputation, history, and capacity also matter a great deal, and how well individual fused have retained their sanity. many of the important fused have a voice, an envoyform singer who represents their fused and helps manage their affairs; voices are generally accorded respect beyond that given to ordinary regals, especially if the fused they serve is particularly important. no singer has been elevated to a fused since their initial creation. the nine[edit] the highest authority among the fused is the nine, a council formed by nine fused. the nine entomb themselves in stone pillars in an atrium through soulcasting, and most will leave their head and one arm free. the stone pillars appear organic, as if grown like trees, and make observers feel like the nine are older than the stones. they hold meetings in the atrium with high-ranked fused, who each bring their voice, to announce them before they speak. they would hear field reports and proposals from the fused. they can accept opinions from other fused but have the final say for anything. they discuss among themselves through a song sung to a rhythm that is unfamiliar to a regal. the lyrics are incomprehensible even to an envoyform, due to odium's influence. raboniel was once among the nine and this position is subject to change. the nine do not eat, living only on voidlight. it is not yet known whether the nine have one of each brand, as the listeners did prior to the everstorm with the five. powers[edit] ""“is it better to have more abilities, or to have one ability handled expertly? we of the fused know our surge with an intimacy a radiant will never know. ”-raboniel to venli"" the fused use powers in ways similar to the knights radiant, but with a few notable differences. like all surgebinders, the fused gain their abilities through manipulation of roshar's fundamental forces, the surges, although unlike them, each one of the nine brands of fused can only access a single surge. a specific fused cannot change forms (and thus, powers). the fused did not always have access to the surges. unlike the knights radiant, who use stormlight, fused are powered by voidlight, and are able to access it by filling gemstones via the song of prayer. voidlight provides the same healing abilities as stormlight. however, it is inefficient in that regard and, given the limited amount, the fused are careful to avoid injury. fused can use their voidlight for passive and active effects; for example, heavenly ones can fly without expending voidlight, and lash other people and things by expending voidlight. they are also able to hold voidlight indefinitely. fused have less investiture than a fourth ideal knight radiant. brands[edit] there are nine brands of fused, each possessing access to a single surge. no brand has access to the surge of adhesion. the brands who have access to the surges of division and tension are as yet unknown. shanay-im[edit] the shanay-im, or heavenly ones, are fused who can manipulate the surge of gravitation. fused of this brand can manipulate their own gravity without expending voidlight, but must use it to heal themselves or to lash things other than themselves. these abilities are similar to the basic lashing used by the windrunners and skybreaker. shanay-im are often seen manipulating the gravitation vector of both themselves and other bodies and objects, resulting in abilities such as flight, reduced weight, and sending their enemies flying off into the air. the fused accelerate more slowly than radiants when using gravitation. this is due to them expending less energy and does not have to do with the gravity of braize. over a large span, fused will go faster than radiants. fused can only lash themselves once. these fused are able to enter space, but cannot travel far, since they would require a large amount of voidlight to heal due to the lack of air and pressure. the shanay-im usually wear extremely long robes, trailing behind them several feet. they utilize long lances suited for aerial combat, with aluminum coating to block shardblades. the lances also incorporate raysium to drain stormlight from radiants. when fighting windrunners, they hold an honorable tradition of one-to-one dueling. they raise their weapons to those they wish to duel, and engage upon consent from the windrunners. the rest of their members float about and do not interfere with the duel. the windrunners play along with the tradition, as the windrunners have a smaller number and this prevents them from being ganged up on. this tradition does not extend to normal soldiers. shetel-im[edit] the shetel-im, or flowing ones, are fused who control the surge of abrasion. this gives them the ability to change the force of friction between objects and bodies, similar to edgedancers. one of the shetel-im participated in the effort to steal the king's drop from the thaylen gemstone reserve. magnified ones[edit] the magnified ones are fused who interact with the surge of progression. they can grow their carapace extremely rapidly and in specific shapes, allowing them to create tools and weapons out of their carapace. this also allows for the creation of extra carapace armor around specific points of their body. they are among the largest and bulkiest of fused brands. they are the only known fused brand without a known alias in the dawnchant ending in -im. mavset-im[edit] the mavset-im, or masked ones, are fused who interact with the surge of illumination. their abilities appear to mimic the lightweavers ability to change their own appearance by creating illusions. one of the mavset-im participated in the effort to steal the king's drop from the thaylen gemstone reserve. even other fused are wary of the mavset-im. fannahn-im[edit] the fannahn-im, or those ones of alteration, are fused who interact with the surge of transformation. this grants them abilities similar to soulcasting, and they are capable of transformations such as turning a sword to dust or breathing out a toxic compound. they may even be able to use their surge to corrupt or unmake spren, though that ability may have been unique to raboniel. the altered ones are considered to be great builders among the fused, responsible for the remodeling of the palace in kholinar following its capture by the singers. these singers are tall even among the fused, reaching heights of seven feet, with hairstrands present only on the very tops of their heads where carapace is not present. nex-im[edit] the nex-im, or husked ones, are fused who control the surge of transportation. this surge allows them to evacuate their body as a ribbon of red light similar to a spren, leaving behind a hollow husk of carapace to crumple to dust, and recreate their body at the destination point. this ribbon cannot squeeze though small gaps. they only hold enough voidlight to make four jumps. thus in battle, they usually use the first three jumps for attacking and the fourth to escape and replenish voidlight. forming a fourth husk will leave them trapped, unable to become a ribbon of light. two ways of killing a husked one include killing them before they evacuate the body, or forcing them to form a fourth body and kill them. they also cannot take anything with them that is not part of their body. because of this, at least one of the fused of this brand, lezian the pursuer, has extremely long hair to cover his body like clothing and uses his carapace spurs as weapons. very few of these fused exist. makay-im[edit] the makay-im, or deepest ones, are fused who control the surge of cohesion. they can manipulate axial connection to phase through solid objects, though they cannot see when doing so, and they cannot take anything that is not part of their body with them. they have sinuous, long-limbed bodies, tall without being as unnaturally willowy as the fannahn-im. they are hairless and have minimal carapace, with only simple shells over their heads and genitals, although some have long, knifelike carapace fingernails suitable for slitting throats. they also have milky white eyes glowing red from behind. of the group that invades urithiru, some walk around nude, while others favor open-fronted robes. they prefer to keep their own company, and they enjoy spending their time sunken in rock as much as the heavenly ones like to soar. notable fused[edit] notes[edit]"
Lanacin,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lanacin,"lanacin the surefooted is a historical figure on roshar. he is said to have killed a shardbearer and won a shardblade. he was presumably alethi, as there is a monument to lanacin in southwest kholinar. kaladin knew of his story, and believed that the stories of men like lanacin and evod markmaker indicated that opportunities for darkeyes had decreased over time in alethkar. either lanacin the surefooted or evod markmaker actually poisoned a shardbearer to obtain their shards, although this isn't well known. notes[edit]"
Shumin,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Shumin,"shumin is a singer on roshar and a member of venli's resistance movement. appearance and personality[edit] shumin is a young femalen singer. she has primarily black skin with bright red marbling. she usually wears workform. she seems timid when in the presence of the fused. in private, her personality is very casual. she does not usually hum to a rhythm to indicate her emotions, instead using human gestures, body language, and speech patterns, including the use of ""stormfather!"" as a curse and referring to venli as ""brightness"". she fears odium and those who follow him, and is excited by the prospect of gaining magical powers from a different source. she has not accepted the notion that it is an honor for a singer to give up their body to a fused and is very eager to foment a revolt against them. her enthusiasm makes her unreliable. attributes and abilities[edit] shumin is a common singer. she has bonded a gravitationspren within her gemheart, which gives her workform. she is not well-informed regarding the history or the abilities of the fused. history[edit] shumin was among venli's recruits into her group of objectors in kholinar that sought to escape the rule of both humans and fused. she was recruited close to a year after the battle of thaylen field, shortly before the fused occupation of urithiru. venli had some disdain for shumin's humanlike attitude and mannerisms, but she knew that singers like shumin would be the most likely to turn against the fused. venli arranged for shumin to ""audition"" to become an assistant stormsetter for leshwi. dul and mazish, who had already been accepted as leshwi's servants, counseled shumin about how to behave in order to get the job. shumin was required to appear before leshwi in the high chamber, including standing at the edge of the room a hundred feet off the ground with no railing. shumin drew some fearspren and was visibly relieved when she was allowed to move away from the edge; leshwi assessed her as timid, but venli successfully argued that shumin should be given a chance to serve. shumin, venli, dul, and mazish retreated to venli's quarters and discussed their next steps. shumin was eager to attack the fused, but venli informed her that their goal was not revolution but simply to escape oppression. shumin was skeptical about the prospects of either finding sympathetic fused or fleeing without their notice, especially given their surgebinding powers. venli revealed that she had been able to imprison her voidspren and still use her powers, which further energized shumin; however, venli did not reveal the existence of timbre. after leshwi's staff was moved to urithiru, shumin was careless in attempting to recruit more people to venli's cause, despite dul and venli's repeated warnings against doing so. venli did not want to send shumin back to kholinar where she would not be able to monitor her, and instead tried to isolate her. shumin was present when venli decided to evacuate her team to kholinar and then somehow get to the shattered plains. she was particularly upbeat about the prospect of asking kaladin for help. after leshwi's rebellion and the liberation of the tower, shumin presumably went to the shattered plains via oathgate with the rest of venli's objectors, seeking to join the other listeners. notes[edit]"
Spren,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Gravitationspren,"""“spren appear when something changes-when fear appears, or when it begins to rain. they are the heart of change, and therefore the heart of all things. ”-hesina to kaladin"" spren (unkalaki: mafah'liki) are fragments of the powers of creation that have gained sentience through the influence of sapient beings on roshar. they are vastly varied in their appearances, characteristics, and levels of intelligence. they are deeply connected with the knights radiant, as a nahel bond between humans and spren is what allows the former to use surgebinding. they are also used to create fabrials. spren are far more extensive and numerous than the closest comparable entities, seons and skaze, splinters of devotion and dominion respectively. this is one of the reasons roshar does not have the same problem with travelling to the cognitive realm as sel -- even though honor is splintered just like the other two shards, on roshar, spren act as a ""release valve"" for the uncontrolled power of honor."
Coreb,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Coreb,"""“ take it. it's yours. stormfather, kaladin. you're a shardbearer! ”- coreb urging kaladin to take the shardblade"" coreb is a darkeyed soldier in kaladin's squad in highmarshal meridas amaram's army on roshar. history[edit] coreb joined kaladin's squad in amaram's army. he became the highest ranked of the men under kaladin's command, as well as the best fighter among them. in 1172, coreb fought in the battle where a full shardbearer, helaran davar, made an attempt to kill amaram. coreb joined kaladin in his charge on the shardbearer. coreb, hab, alabet, and reesh were the only men of kaladin's squad to survive the fight with the helaran. coreb witnessed kaladin's defeat of the shardbearer. when helaran died, coreb was stunned, urging kaladin to take the shardblade for himself. however, kaladin was disgusted by the blade. kaladin left the battlefield, telling coreb that he did not want the blade and that it was coreb's blade now. later that day, coreb was summoned to amaram's warcenter, along with kaladin and the other survivors of the squad. kaladin repeated his desire to give the shards to coreb. amaram instead ordered his men to kill the surviving four men of kaladin's squad. coreb was the last to fall. although he initially did not scream, backing away from the soldiers, in his final moments, he fell to his knees and begged for his life. one of amaram's soldiers cut off coreb's head, killing him. although coreb was killed, kaladin remembered coreb fondly, and the memory of coreb's death helped to fuel kaladin's hatred of amaram. when amaram faces kaladin during the battle of thaylen field, kaladin accuses amaram of feeling guilt for killing coreb, hab and other members of kaladin's squad. notes[edit]"
Singer,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Workform,"""“the betrayal of spren has brought us here.they gave their surges to human heirs,but not to those who know them most dear, before us.’tis no surprise we turned awayunto the gods we spent our daysand to become their molding clay, they changed us. ”-song of secrets, 40th stanza"" the singers are a sapient species on roshar, which humans call the parsh or parshmen. one such group of singers are the listeners. singers communicate through special rhythms--hence them being called singers. singers can bond various spren which change their forms. singers predate the humans as inhabitants of roshar. around the time of the recreance, many of the singers had their connection and identity stolen, pieces of their souls ripped away. this made those singers docile and subservient, which humans called parshmen and used as slaves for millennia later. with the advent of the everstorm, these singers were healed and restored. biology and appearance[edit] singers are humanoid, but not entirely human-like. the most apparent sign of their alien nature is their skin; it's covered in marblings, swirls of various colors - red, black or white. most singers have two-colored skin, either red-black or red-white; the marblings can appear in various way, both as delicate swirls and large, wind-swept patterns. there are singers whose skin has all three colors, but they are extremely rare. the color whitening at the edges is a sign of age. their hair is typically orange or red -- colors that don't seem to naturally occur for rosharan humans. there is a relationship between the color of singer hair and their individual marbling colors. apart from their multicolored skin, singers have other features that differentiate them from humans. they grow faster compared to humans but have slightly shorter lifespans. in the listeners' culture, venli started to learn about singing as a keeper of songs at age three and is considered adult at age ten. their bodies have carapace growing over some parts of them; where and how much depends on what form the singer is currently in, but they typically cover the head and the arms. in addition, their teeth are built differently than human ones; their molars allow them to chew through shells, and their metabolism is geared towards metabolizing it, allowing them to make better use of the local fauna. their eyes are also inhuman - all black, with no whites in the corners and no visible iris. singers have orange blood. like many local species, singers possess gemhearts, though theirs are clouded white, and fused to their sternum. those gemhearts allow them to bond with spren, letting them change their forms, leading to a change in both appearance and some mental faculty. due to their gemhearts, singers do not leak lights like humans do. singers can drink crem without getting sick. despite those differences, singers are like humans in many spiritual aspects. like humans, they can receive boons and curses from the nightwatcher. they can also bond spren to attain radiant powers, though most spren are unwilling to reach out for such a bond. singers can see the reality of the spren more closely than a human. they also don't get cold as easily as humans. sexes and reproduction[edit] singers possess four distinct sexes; male and female, which are capable of reproduction, and their neutered variants, malen and femalen. singers' sex will change from between male and malen, or female and femalen, as they change forms; the vast majority of forms are either malen or femalen. as such, most singers are asexual the vast majority of the time. singers usually identify as one of those four genders as well, though some identify with a non-binary gender and singer culture recognizes at least one non-binary gender. despite those differences, singers and humans are capable of cross-breeding; the herdazians and unkalaki are notable examples of human ethnicities with singer ancestry. this ancestry is the source of the herdazians' stone-like nails as well as the unkalaki's shell-chewing teeth and red hair. as a result of their singer ancestry, herdazians and unkalaki are also more likely to identify as asexual. it's unknown whether there are currently any people with both human and singer ancestry who identify as singers. forms[edit] by bonding various spren in the highstorm or everstorm, singers are capable of changing their form, leading to a different appearance, capabilities and even mental state, as well as changing subtly their spiritual aspect. it is possible that the forms also alter identity. new forms come with a level of instinctual understanding. singers can maintain their form indefinitely, without needing to resupply with stormlight or voidlight, and can use the abilities granted by the form without needing additional fuel. new forms could exist. certain things can stop a singer from changing forms, such as shardplate. the forms are specializations, and gear the singer towards a particular purpose; for example, warform grants armor and increased strength, making it suitable for combat, while nimbleform grants dexterity, making it good for delicate tasks. there are also more specific forms, such as artform for creative endeavours, or mateform for breeding. aside from dullform, every form is associated with a specific type of spren. ordinarily, what spren a singer will bond -- and thus what form they'll assume -- depends on their mindset during the highstorm. however, capturing a spren in a gemstone and bringing it into the storm all but ensures that a specific form will be selected. bonding to a corrupted spren will give different results. when changing forms, a singer may temporarily not be able to hear certain rhythms, or hear pure tones. hemalurgy could also be used to replicate the transformation of the forms. listeners recounted many common forms in the song of listing; they also have songs speaking of forms of power -- the song of secrets and the song of winds. known common forms[edit] these forms are mentioned in the listener song of listing. after the recreance and before the true desolation, when the only singers who could think were the listeners, the listeners only discovered five forms: dullform, mateform, warform, workform, and nimbleform. when the everstorm arrived and healed the other singers, singers held these forms and other common forms the listeners could not reproduce, such as artform and scholarform, and had a ""dozen"" options. dullform[edit] ""“ dullform dread, with the mind most lost.the lowest, and one not bright.to find this form, one needs banish cost.it finds you and brings you to blight. ”- final stanza of the song of listing"" dullform occurs when a singer bonds an incorrect spren, or a spren that does not grant any other form. it's physically similar to the ""slaveform"" of the parshmen, to the point where a dullform singer can easily pass for one. it is also mentally limiting; those in dullform find thinking difficult, as if they were half-asleep, and have a harder time hearing the rhythms. dullform was one of the two forms the last legion was left with after breaking away from the rest of the singers, alongside mateform. it was largely abandoned as other forms were rediscovered. however, listener spies still used it when infiltrating the human warcamps, thanks to its similarity to slaveform. singer children are born in dullform, though for them, it is more vibrant and less cloudy; a property it loses as the singer ages. the listeners call this subtype of dullform ""childform"". they need to take another form around the age of seven or eight. mateform[edit] ""“ mateform meek, for love to share,given to life, it brings us joy.to find this form, one must care.true empathy, one must employ. ”- 5th stanza of the song of listing"" mateform is used by singers to reproduce; though the other forms are capable of having children, mateform is the one most specialized for the purpose. in female singers, entering mateform increases the size of their breasts; it's unknown what physical effect it has on male singers. mentally, mateform causes a singer to behave irresponsibly and become distracted in favour of the form's primary purpose; mateforms will sometimes ignore their assigned task, or do things that are expressly forbidden, without realizing the issue with that. some singers are, however, capable of keeping themselves together while in mateform, though this requires strong mental discipline. singers in mateform are bonded with lifespren. it was one of the original forms the last legion had after abandoning the regal forms, alongside dullform. presently, most singers assume it only transiently, when they wish to attempt having children, though there are some who keep it on at all times. warform[edit] ""“ warform is worn for battle and reign,claimed by the gods, given to kill.unknown, unseen, but vital to gain.it comes to those with the will. ”- 15th stanza of the song of listing"" warform gives listeners an armor-like carapace, and makes them taller and bulkier than other forms. the carapace armor is designed to trap air and push it up underneath to cool the singer. it grants them vastly increased strength; a singer in warform can leap over a chasm of the shattered plains with a running start. stamina is greatly increased, allowing singers to run for hours without strain. it also deepens their voice. out of all the forms known to the listeners, warform requires the most food, but is also the most durable, and a warform singer heals faster than they would in any other form. mentally, the warform has less impact than most others; it makes one more pragmatic and slightly more inclined towards violence. it also severely hampers artistic ability, and is not well-equipped to handle abstractions. singers in warform are bonded with painspren. the first listeners to enter warform heard the pure tone of honor. workform[edit] ""“ workform worn for strength and care.whispering spren breathe at your ear.seek first this form, its mysteries to bear.found here is freedom from fear. ”- 19th stanza of the song of listing"" workform endows increased strength, though it lacks the armor; rather, singers in workform are limber and rugged. it's better suited for labor, and most workers use it; however, it is also sometimes used when fighting. singers in workform have carapace in ridges along the backs of their hands, and no carapace on the rest of their body. they are also fairly resistant to cold weather. while in workform, singers are more obedient, and have greater difficulty committing violence, forcing one to find peaceful solutions to various problems. it's also considered more flexible than warform. singers in workform are bonded with gravitationspren. the first listeners to bond workform heard the pure tone of cultivation. nimbleform[edit] ""“ nimbleform has a delicate touch.gave the gods this form to many,tho' once defied, by the gods they were crushed.this form craves precision and plenty. ”- 27th stanza of the song of listing"" nimbleform is a general form without any singular, apparent function; rather, it's useful for all work that requires dexterity and care. for this reason, listeners use it for tasks such as research, art, and raising children. it has no carapace, and less endurance than other forms; singers in nimbleform are physically weaker, grow longer hair, and have thinner, more slender facial features. it does not impede the mind, and in fact encourages greater focus. this form was rediscovered by the singers during the war of reckoning, through research led by venli. it is possible that a bond with a windspren is what allows singers to enter nimbleform. during the true desolation, most liberated singers wore either it or workform. mediationform[edit] ""“ mediationform made for peace, it's said.form of teaching and consolation.when used by the gods, it became insteadform of lies and desolation. ”- 33rd stanza of the song of listing"" little is known about mediationform; it appears to bestow improved speech capabilities, or better ability to convince or bestow information upon others. singers in mediationform have smooth, beautiful carapace, and open faces. the head researcher of the listeners, venli, claimed that she was looking for it throughout the war of reckoning, but in reality, she never truly attempted to rediscover mediationform in the first place, instead searching for stormform. scholarform[edit] ""“ scholarform shown for patience and thought.beware its ambitions innate.though study and diligence bring the reward,loss of innocence may be one's fate. ”- 69th stanza of the song of listing"" though present in the song of listing, scholarform has only been reclaimed during the true desolation; during the war of reckoning, listeners used nimbleform as a substitute. it appears to increase one's mental faculty and patience. physically, it produces long hairstrands and angular features. artform[edit] ""“ artform applied for beauty and hue.one yearns for the songs it creates.most misunderstood by the artist it's true,come the spren to foundation's fates. ”-90th stanza of the song of listing"" ""“ artform for colors beyond our ken;for its grand songs we yearn.we must attract creationspren;these songs suffice 'til we learn. ”-279th stanza of the song of revision"" artform is formed by bonding creationspren; as its name implies, it specializes in artistic expression, such as painting or music. venli claimed to be researching this form to other listeners, though that was most likely a lie. it has not been discovered during the war of reckoning, but rather returned to the singers through the everstorm. forms of power[edit] ""“qualify yourselves for greater service, and you will be elevated to the place of a regal, given a form of power. ”-fused propaganda"" forms of power are attained by bonding a voidspren rather than an ordinary spren. within odium's army, such singers are referred to as regals. in contrast to common forms, forms of power bestow explicitly supernatural abilities, such as being able to shoot lightning from one's fingers or speak any language in the world. they can drastically alter one's ways of thinking, such as making people more selfish and callous, and can feel intoxicating. they allow singers to hear and use new rhythms, but make hearing the old ones extremely difficult. forms of power include, among others, stormform, nightform, smokeform, decayform, and envoyform. slaveform[edit] ""“they may have taken your freedom, but they took our minds. ”-sah to kaladin on their respective forms of slavery"" the term slaveform is how listeners describe singers with no spren bond, no form, and vastly limited mental capacity; humans refer to such singers as the parshmen. it looks visually similar to dullform, enough so that humans can confuse the two. slaveform did not exist until after the false desolation. it was created when melishi led a strike team to capture ba-ado-mishram, who was providing the singers with regal forms. though successful, it had an unintended side effect of robbing singers of connection and identity, and thus creating slaveform. physically, slaveform singers are strong enough to perform physical labor. however, they lack identity and connection, rendering them mentally stunted. though seemingly capable of feeling and understanding their situation, they cannot fully comprehend it. their awareness is dreamlike and they have no capacity to understand fully or act on their feelings. they are capable of processing and understanding orders, and will obey without question. when left on their own, they sit around, not doing anything. despite this, slaveform singers do retain some mental faculty. they can speak, though rarely do so. they care about and are protective of their dead, usually objecting to anyone tending to them. they also care for their young, though they have little capacity to object if separated. the passing of the everstorm has healed the parshmen by restoring their connection and identity. as such, this form no longer exists during the true desolation. exploitation[edit] prior to the arrival of the everstorm, parshmen are used as slave labor across the entirety of roshar. parshmen slaves are typically more expensive than human ones, due to being naturally obedient and extremely unlikely to attempt an escape. singers who can successfully birth healthy children are purposefully bred, and often sold off on this basis, even if this requires splitting up families. they are often used as servants, as well as heavy menial labor. they are used as porters in various locations around the world, hauling both cargo and carriages. many countries rely on them for their economy and proper functioning of their cities; the loss of their labor due to the everstorm would spell a crisis even without the ongoing war. rhythms[edit] singers are connected to rhythms, the underlying ""beats"" of the cosmere that manifest particularly strongly on roshar. there are numerous rhythms, and singers can attune to any one of them. each rhythm represents a certain state of mind, emotion or feeling; when not paying attention, singers will attune to the rhythm that corresponds to their mood, but can also attune another to fit with their message. this attuning manifests as hearing the beat of the rhythm in one's head. all rhythms connect the singers to each other and roshar itself. this, and their regular nature, allows the singers to use the rhythms for measuring time, among others. the singers speak and sing to the rhythms; they carry the singers' emotions, as well as add meaning to their words. however, not all forms can attune the rhythms equally. dullform can only hear them weakly; slaveform cannot hear them at all. additionally, those infused with the power of odium, mainly the regals and the fused, can only hear odium's rhythms, also called the rhythms of power. those rhythms, while similar to regular ones, are usually more violent and aggressive, and represent more twisted, angrier emotions -- for example, ridicule replaces amusement, and command approximates appreciation. they also feel and sound different than the ordinary rhythms. soothers can affect singer rhythms and may dampen odium's influence. singers with the third heightening would be able to sing pure tones of planets other than roshar, and could potentially do this before the third heightening. history[edit] the dawnsingers[edit] ""“our pity destroyed us. ”-from the eila stele"" the singers predate the arrival of humans on roshar, having been created as part of the planet's natural ecosystem. after the expulsion, in which mankind accidentally destroyed their homeworld, ashyn, the ancient singers were ordered by their gods honor and cultivation to help the human refugees who arrived on their planet. these ancient singers were known as the dawnsingers. initially, the two species interacted peaceably, with some singers and humans even intermingling, creating herdazians and the unkalaki. however, mankind's arrival also brought odium, and conflict soon began. humans, originally granted only the land of shinovar, sought to expand, causing the conflict that would eventually come to be known as the first desolation. during that time, the singers came to call humans ""voidbringers"", as humans cannot hear the rhythms. in that conflict, spren eventually came to side with humans, leading to a sense of deep betrayal in the singers. it seems that the singers did something that caused the spren to turn on them. the fused[edit] at some point, honor and cultivation sided with the humans, while singers came to work with odium, who granted their most valiant warriors immortality and great power to fight against the humans. this power made them into cognitive shadows, and allowed them to be reborn by possessing the bodies of other singers. those immortal singers came to be known as the fused. the fused became both gods and rulers of the singers, despising mankind, wanting humans wiped off roshar regardless of the cost. to combat the fused, honor created the ten heralds, who would imprison them on braize until one of them broke, whereupon the fused and heralds would return to roshar and a new desolation would begin. the cycle continued for many centuries until finally, at the aharietiam, the heralds decided to leave only the strongest among them, taln, to face the torture alone. not all singers, however, were eager to battle mankind continuously for odium. one such group, the last legion, abandoned the regal forms granted to them by odium and left for the shattered plains, where they would settled, far from the ongoing conflict. they would eventually dub themselves the listeners. the parsh[edit] ""“the parsh, as they are now called, continue their war with zeal, even without their masters from damnation. ”-from the urithiru gem archive"" the singers, no longer the dominant species on roshar, continued to fight mankind and the knights radiant. over the centuries, they came to be known as the parsh, though the meaning of the word is unclear. around two thousand years after the last desolation, near the recreance, another conflict between the two species flared up. dubbed the false desolation, it was notable for the participation of ba-ado-mishram, one of odium's unmade. ba-ado-mishram connected with the singers and provided them regal forms and voidlight, as odium once did in the desolations, allowing the singers to wage war at levels closer to those of the real desolations. in response, the knights radiant imprisoned ba-ado-mishram. they succeeded, but in doing so, stole part of singers' souls, ripping out their connection and identity and turning them into near-mindless husks. these singers without form -- ""slaveforms"" to listeners, and parshmen to humans -- became the property of humans, turned into cheap, menial labor that would be exploited for millennia to come. the only ones who escaped that fate were the listeners, as they had broken ties with the unmade and odium. the listeners[edit] the listeners lived on in the shattered plains for the next few millennia, forming a number of tribes settled in the craters around the western edge of the plains. eventually, they made contact with the alethi and, through diplomatic efforts, forged a treaty. however, on the night the treaty was to be signed, the listener eshonai learned about king gavilar's plans to return the ""listener gods"" -- the fused -- to roshar. fearing the consequences, the listeners arranged for gavilar to be assassinated. as a result, they were forced to flee, abandoning their homes for the more distant plateau of narak right as humans arrived to exact vengeance. thus began the war of reckoning. after six years of constant warfare, the listeners, manipulated by the voidspren, recovered stormform, one of regal forms. spurred on by its mental state, they planned to summon the everstorm, which they succeeded at during the battle of narak. as it passed over roshar, the everstorm restored all parshmen, healing their connection and identity. the new singers[edit] ""“can't we simply enjoy being able to think? being able to exist? ”-vldgen"" the newly restored singers assumed seemingly random forms. their attitudes were similar to those of the humans they spent their entire lives around -- the alethi singers were angry and warlike, the azish singers wished to negotiate with the government, and the thaylen singers stole ships and sailed away. most of them, however, were quickly swept up by the fused, who have returned and seek to create new armies with which to conquer roshar. to make these new singers more combat-ready, the fused employed not only their natural anger at their former oppressors, but also hefty amounts of propaganda, most notably using the supposedly last listener, venli, as their mouthpiece. however, many singers are still apprehensive about fighting humans, and some outright wish that peace was an option. some singers use the term essai to describe a human supporter (though the actual translation means ""hairy""). known singer groups[edit] - - the singer nation on the - - singers who have bonded - - - of singers bound to - -

""“what is it? what is it! no, i didn't kill you!”-relis when kaladin catches his blade"" two days later, relis brought three others to the duel: elit, abrobadar and jakamav. relis viewed the duel as punishment for adolin rather than a matter of honor, but things turned against him when first renarin and then kaladin joined the fight. he made mistake of underestimating the threat kaladin, armed only with a spear and wearing no armor, posed to him. first, kaladin drew relis away from adolin and the others and weakened his shardplate with a stormlight-reinforced kick. kaladin defeated elit while relis rejoined the fight against adolin, but he soon distracted relis and jakamav again long enough for adolin to defeat abrodabar. near the end of the duel, when relis saw that adolin had managed to time his plate locking up with getting an incapacitating hold on jakamav, he ran for renarin. kaladin caught up to him in time for relis to swing at him instead, but he caught relis's blade between his bare hands; the resulting screaming from the blade was enough to make relis retreat from the arena in forfeit. after the fight, relis's father was embarrassed enough to send him back to alethkar. there, he fought against the voidbringers as they encroached northward into alethkar. he attempted to rally the rest of the troops in the country, but they were forced back towards herdaz. at an unknown point, relis and his brother ivanar confided in wit about their father's physical abuse. after his father forfeited his title and lands, relis became highprince ruthar. despite relis's former antagonism towards the kholins, he showed willingness to cooperate with them as a highprince. notes[edit]"
Arshqqam,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Stump,"arshqqam, also known as the stump, is a woman who runs the tashi's light orphanage in yeddaw. she is also a knight radiant of the order of truthwatchers. appearance and personality[edit] the stump is an elderly woman who is very stern. many of the children in the orphanage don't like her and neither do most of the surrounding urchins. despite this, arshqqam looks fondly upon the children noting they gave her the nickname of the ""the stump"" and calling it a ""glorious title, to come from children"". she does, however, also like her original name. ""“her skin drooped off her bones like something you'd might hack up after catching the crud in the slums, and she had spindly fingers that lift figured might be twigs she'd glued in place after her real ones fell off”-lift on arshqqam"" arshqqam has spindly fingers and and her skin droops. she also appears fragile. lift describes her as a shrivelled up weed of a woman. further, she says that the woman looks like the child of a broom and a particularly determined clump of moss. in turn, once joining the knight's radiant, the stump confesses she is fond of lift though feels lift needs a firm hand. arshqqam did not want to leave her life in tashikk behind but felt compelled to join the knight's radiant once her powers manifested. she does not understand why she in particular was chosen given her advanced age but if lift, a child, was joining the cause, she felt there was no excuse for her not to do so. veil looks favourably on the stump, commenting that there is more to the stump than the surface level would suggest. she notes arshqqam's careful yet understated attention to her appearance and the ease with which she is able to discuss strategy with adolin, a powerful man, without being intimidated. history[edit] running tashi's light orphanage[edit] the stump ran the orphanage and seemed to have done so for some time. she wasn't well liked by those on the outside; according to lift, they said she was mean and only gave away food because she wanted to look good for the officials who watch the place, yet it was possible that she founded the orphanage. she was known to run a money laundering scheme that involved exchanging donations to the orphanage with dun spheres. she had been unconsciously using her spheres' stormlight to heal sick urchins in her care, who she then mistakenly accused of only pretending to be sick. after learning of her true nature, the charges against her were dismissed by the prime aqasix on behalf of lift. when nale instructed his skybreakers to hunt down a radiant in yeddaw, they mistakenly thought it was arclo. in truth, nale was after the stump. after a brief altercation involving lift, the herald stabbed the stump but did not kill her immediately, in order to lure lift out, who then healed her after nale abandoned his hunt for radiants. some colleagues of jasnah convinced the stump to visit azimir, probably to speak with ethid, and she let them make sketches of her spren. expedition to lasting integrity[edit] due to the honorspren's high-regard for truthwatchers, the stump was chosen by adolin and shallan to join the expedition to lasting integrity. she disagreed with adolin's initial plan of trying to convince the honorspren by guilt or threat. instead, she backed taking a more emotional and passionate approach suggested by her spren, dreaming-though-awake, and advised adolin that any approach would need to appeal to the honorspren's sense of honor. upon adolin's capture she, along with zu and other soldiers on the expedition, left to report to dalinar about the trial in lasting integrity. notes[edit]"

Rine,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rine,"""“we must exterminate them. our people will never be safe on this world as long as the humans exist. ”-rine"" rine is a shanay-im fused on roshar. he interacts with venli on several occasions. appearance and personality[edit] rine is one of the few fused who are still sane. during the true desolation, he possesses the body of a tall singer. as one of the shanay-im, he wears a long cloak and does not walk on the ground, preferring to hover a few feet above it. certain listener traditions seem to baffle him, such as their taboos regarding dead bodies and their reluctance to talk about gemhearts. he is sometimes dismissive of venli, although he more readily accepts her words when she speaks respectfully and uses the ancient tongue. like other fused, he speaks and hums to odium's rhythms, although he is one of the few to use the calmer rhythm of withdrawal. rine remembers the ancient desolations and the shock among the fused when they realized the existence and the strength of the nahel bond between spren and humans. in rine's opinion, it is more important to keep a close watch on human slaves than to exploit them as workers; he fears that surgebinders might arise among them. attributes and abilities[edit] rine is a cognitive shadow that serves odium. like all fused, he is able to travel from braize to roshar and possess the body of a singer during a desolation. he is able to use voidlight and manipulate the surge of gravitation. he seems to rank relatively highly among the fused, likely due to his sanity. he led the team that traveled through alethkar proselytizing singers, and typically conferred with a town's spren right before they moved from one town to another. history[edit] rine guided venli in her preachings to the newly awakened alethi parshmen. at first they visited small villages, but after this practice they moved on to kholinar. rine personally helped fly venli to the new location. in kholinar, the true labor began, with venli giving many presentations each day. when venli compared the newly awakened parshmen to babes, rine compared her to a toddler. after rine and venli had been in kholinar for some time, they joined the fleet that was preparing for the battle of thaylen field. rine offered venli the opportunity to refresh herself in the cabin of their ship, but venli asked him why they needed such a large fleet when they had the fused. rine answered that the most skilled fused had yet to awaken and even if they did, they would not fight alone. he became philosophical on the subject, and said that once the humans had been defeated, the fused would hand over roshar to the singers and finally get to rest. notes[edit]"
Eelakin Islands,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Eelakin_Islands,"the eelakin islands are the homeland of the eelakin people on first of the sun, a planet in the drominad system. geography[edit] the eelakin often refer to the islands as the ""homeisles"", and to its residents as ""homeislers"". there are likely a number of islands, as sixth of the dusk mentions that the eelakin islands superficially resemble the pantheon archipelago. it takes approximately three weeks rowing to travel from the homeisles to the pantheon. the eelakin have extensive contact with the mainland, but the distance from the islands to the continent is not known. flora and fauna[edit] unlike the wild pantheon, the eelakin islands have been ""tamed"". the eelakin islands lack the dangerous predators and plant life of the pantheon; it is unclear if those species never existed in the homeisles or if they were eradicated in the distant past. birds are known to live in the pantheon, the homeisles, and the mainland; most species are endemic to a particular location, and only those that are raised in the pantheon have traditionally become aviar. culture[edit] the eelakin originally lived as wayfinders and trappers. after the islands were tamed, the lack of natural dangers eventually allowed for cultural and technological advancements in homeisler society. civilization on the homeisles now stands in stark contrast to the solitary, austere life of the trappers who still live in the pantheon. trappers are the only eelakin who maintain some of the old ways, including wayfinding. homeislers and trappers are both ethnically eelakin, but have numerous misconceptions about each other; dusk feels like an outsider when he visits the homeisles, and he does not understand their social conventions. homeislers no longer use ""traditional"" names that refer to the day and order of birth, instead using names that originated on the mainland. homeislers have become increasingly educated, and dusk believes that they have lost their reverence for aviar. eelakin society may be patriarchal, as vathi believes that the (possibly apocryphal) story of yaalani the brave is repeated often to young eelakin girls as a way to reinforce the traditional role of women in their society. history[edit] in the centuries following the taming of the homeisles, the eelakin people slowly built their relationship with the mainland. trade occurred between the two peoples, and certain cultural conventions of the mainland began to creep into eelakin society. this relationship began to accelerate as eelakin technology advanced, largely due to a burgeoning market for aviar. several large eelakin companies such as the northern interests trading company actively attempted to find and capture more aviar in the pantheon in order to satisfy mainlander demand. this process was hastened even further by technology gained through eelakin contact with the spacefaring ones above, which further emboldened companies to undertake large-scale projects such as the patji expedition. notes[edit]"
Sori,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sori,"sori is a small island in the pantheon on first of the sun. geography[edit] sori is one of over forty islands in the pantheon archipelago. it is referred to by sixth of the dusk as the ""least"" of the islands, and is therefore presumably the smallest island by area. it is located on the end of the archipelago closest to the eelakin islands, as it is the first island dusk sees when he returns from a trip there. sori is approximately three weeks' journey from the homeisles by rowboat. three nearby islands are referred to as sori's ""cousins"". ecology[edit] as an island in the pantheon, sori is home to various unique creatures and plants. deepwalkers can be found in the waters nearby, and there are traps in its jungles. exploring sori presents some challenges, but it is far less dangerous than other islands in the pantheon. although it presumably has some of the same wildlife found on other islands, dusk mentions that it lacks valuable game; it is likely that certain species of pantheon animals are not found on sori. however, aviar may live on the island, as dusk's uncle gives him a mating plume as part of his training on sori. culture[edit] in the eelakin tradition, the islands of the pantheon are personified, and the name sori means ""child"". sori is considered to be loved by all of the other islands. all trappers are welcome there, and a trapper can make an offering to sori without causing their own island of residence to become jealous. unlike other islands, all trappers have spent time on sori during their apprenticeships, and the island is the most visited in the pantheon. because sori is more tame than other islands, it is used as a training ground for young trappers before they choose another island in the pantheon to live on. trainees are prohibited from visiting other islands until they have completed their training on sori. dusk recalls training with his uncle on sori and has fond memories of his time there. notes[edit]"

Jak,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Allomancer_Jak,"jak also known as ""allomancer jak"" and ""gentleman jak"", is a scadrian nobleman and an explorer. appearance & personality[edit] jak is depicted in all his broadsheets as being a well groomed man around his early thirties. he is always shown sporting a large mustache which is complimented by long hair and glasses. although his outfit varies from time to time it almost always bares a resemblance to a suit of some kind with a mistcloak added. the mistcloak seemingly serves no purpose since jak is not known to be a coinshot or lurcher. when in less formal settings and outside exploring he is also depicted as wearing a cowboy hat. jak also has frequently wears buttoned up shirts, which apparently have a tendency to break open as his stories go on, underneath of which he is shown to have a well muscled physique. it can be difficult to understand what jak's personality is like as the depiction of him in his adventures and the opinions of those around him diverge greatly. as depicted by himself jak is shown to be a craft and courageous individual who displays little to no fear at the variety of threats that face him. he is shown to be competent and capable of escaping a wide array of dangerous scenarios using his smarts alone. being both well cultured and travelled he also has little issues getting along with those whose paths he crosses during his ventures. in contrast to this however his closest peers give a different account of both his personality and adventures, according to his editor and terris steward, handerwym, jak is in fact quite ignorant about the events he writes about. handerwym attests that jak does little in the way of true research or in double checking his accounts for accuracy, not even for grammar mistakes or continuity. most of these errors are rectified by handerwym come the publication of the book editions of his journeys with biting commentary given in the form of footnotes also added to provide a more accurate account of events. while refraining from outright stating that jak lies in his adventures handerwym displays a large amount of doubt about his more outlandish claims. from these footnotes a different image of jak is painted in which he appears more idiotic than brave during his adventures, it seems a common occurance for him to completely misunderstand what is happening and instead consistently escalating situations. despite this, and the many improbable claims that jak makes, he himself does not actually think he is lying whilst recounting his stories. attributes and abilities[edit] jak is a tin misting (aka a tineye) who is apparently skilled at using his abilities to help assist him in seeking out important information. he also is proficient in a gun that he wields which he named glint. jak also seemingly has a good skill in animal handling as he claims to have managed to domesticate a 'long necked' animal from the roughs. the animal in question being either a llama or a giraffe. history[edit] early adventuring[edit] jak began his adventuring career sometime around the year 319 pc, his stories initially received great success and acclaim with stories about him reaching as far as the roughs. he was noted due to the claim that he had never killed a criminal yet and instead arrested them. over the years jak would eventually leave the roughs and begin exploring more distant and dangerous locations. he was thrown into the ocean in allomancer jak and the mask of ages while tied to a bust of the survivor (or the lord mistborn). he claims to have swum through river rapids in allomancer jak and the waters of dread, although this may not have actually happened. he also at some stage climbed the ashmounts and domesticated a long necked animal. the pits of eltania[edit] during a later adventure jak ventured to the pits of eltania in search of the survivor's treasure. he at one stage believed he was to be executed for some unknown transgression against the local koloss tribe. before being executed jak was allowed to say goodbye to his acquaintances. jak managed to recover his gun from handerwym while embracing him. jak used the gun to escape his bonds and kill his executioner. jak then resolved to be accepted by the koloss tribe as one of their own, he also came to believe that he was now king of the tribe. he would be challenged by a koloss and managed to kill them with his gun. this was apparently part of his plan to be accepted by the koloss tribe but handerwym felt it was not a good one. jak would later wake up alone in a cave within a canyon and believed himself trapped there. after searching for an exit he would eventually decide to dive into a river below him. he then managed to exit the river near a group of koloss. the group brought him over to their tribe leaders who offered to make jak into a koloss believing him to be worthy of joining the tribe, jak also discovered that his girlfriend, elizandra dramali is koloss blooded and herself a previous member of the tribe. dramali tries to explain the process to jak so he can choose but he interrupts her and devises a plan to not be made into a koloss. jak proclaims that he is already a koloss and that he will prove it by recovering the survivors treasure from the bottom of a lake. he was successful in this endeavour and the koloss were pleased to discover a cache of hemalurgic spikes within it. jak then discovered the box containing the spikes was made of aluminium, pleased with the find he left the tribe with elizandra. they would later have to go back upon realising they had forgotten handerwym and had left him behind. new seran[edit] during a later adventure jak would find himself at new seran where handerwym caught news that criminals were going to replace the alleged buttons of spook's favorite smoking jacket with forgeries. deciding to put a stop to this jak and handerwym went to an auction for the buttons being held by lady lavont. handerwym was left to keep an eye on the buttons and make sure they were not swapped out with fakes while jak went off to talk to lady lavont and her circle of friends. while doing so a man pulled a gun on jak claiming he had killed his brother and that he wanted revenge. in an effort to buy time jak proclaimed that he was unarmed and spun around in a circle to prove his point, then realizing he did not recall killing the man's brother he informed him that he was innocent. the man then realized that he had mistaken jak for wax, jak laughed off the mistake and offered to buy him a drink. before he got the chance however handerwym arrived and signaled to jak that the buttons had been stolen. at a later time jak made the acquaintance of nicelle sauvage who then started publishing under the allomancer jak brand. she would later serve as his assistant during his ventures, a time nicki considered among the strangest in her life. breakup with handerwym[edit] in the years following the discovery of the bands of mourning jak continued to publish his stories and by happenstance discovered a large amount of survivor artifacts. whilst expanding his business jak decided to invest in new forms of media entertainment and in order to fund these ventures took a stake out of handerwym's ownership in the company. this led to a public falling out between the two with the judge ultimately siding with handerwym. jak continued to be published in the sentinel of truth while handerwym kept exclusive access to the two seasons as well as other papers. nicelle sauvage would continue under handerwym's banner. relationships[edit] waxillium ladrian[edit] wax much like jak began his career in the roughs working to collect money from the various bounties around the region. jak was his elder in this profession by about 6 years as wax began this career sometime around 325 pc. despite this common connection however it appears that the two never got along during the early days, wax himself states that he found jak's stories ridiculous and considered him a 'fop' rather than a true lawman[citation needed] whilst jak on the other hand showed open disdain for wax stating that he would gladly look forward to shooting him if given the chance. the reason for this animosity is unclear however it would seem that the pair never actually worked together as neither jak or wax ever mention working with the other, notably wax does not list jak with the other lawmen he worked with in the roughs. later on however their relationship would slowly improve over time, at least on jak's end. following the discovery of the bands of mourning and the start of wax's political career jak would warm considerably to the man and begin mentioning him much more frequently in his writings, insisting that the pair were friends and comrades during past adventures. wax himself denies this and grows quite frustrated when the connection is mentioned, however he is willingly to play along with the story when needed to comfort someone. publishing[edit] his sensationalized adventures are published in the elendel daily and the house record. in the house record he does insult other newspapers and claims the house record is superior to them which may suggest some kind of brand deal he has with them. these versions are unedited by handerwym and as a result are terribly written. handerwym then takes several episodes and combines them into one volume that he edits and annotates. the annotations generally consist of humorous insults and corrections. a story about nicelle sauvage in the new ascendancy is published under an ""allomancer jak presents"" logo, suggesting that jak may help publish the stories of other adventurers. he is known to have published various series, notably allomancer jak and the mask of ages, allomancer jak and the waters of dread, allomancer jak and the pits of eltania, and gentleman jak in the city of fountains. although far more are referenced to, but left unnamed. gentleman jak in the city of fountains is further known to have named episodes, with part 5: a sport of spirits and part 6: the sinister soiree trivia[edit] - jak appears to be a - , as he references the - providing for him and regards the survivor's teachings as true. however, he thinks his alleged spirit guide - may be a - (which are part

Patji expedition,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Patji_expedition,"the patji expedition is a commercial and scientific exploration of the island of patji in the pantheon archipelago on first of the sun. background[edit] patji is one of more than forty islands in the pantheon. it is teeming with deadly flora and fauna, and is uninhabited by the local people (the eelakin) with the exception of a few specially trained trappers. trappers use native birds with magical powers known as aviar to avoid death on the island. notably, patji contains patji's eye, a natural manifestation of investiture, and patji's fingers, a tree that bears fruit containing parasitic worms that grant the aviar their abilities. history[edit] the expedition was carried out by the northern interests trading company, which was based in the eelakin homeisles. the company's main purpose was to research the aviar and to claim patji ahead of competing companies. the company sent at least two large, iron-hulled ships equipped with cannons, one of which was captained by eusto. eusto served as the leader of the expedition, although he appeared to be threatened by vathi, a scholar who had significant knowledge of trappers and also had her own aviar. the team had approximately two hundred soldiers and one hundred scientists and merchants. when the expedition arrived on patji, the team set up their base, which was a small fortress. a scout team including vathi was sent to circle the island and set up a second fortress, but they were attacked by a deepwalker while camping on the beach. vathi was the only survivor. the trapper sixth of the dusk came across the remnants of the scout team's camp and realized that the company was making a full-fledged effort to occupy the island. he noted that mercantile companies from the homeisles have discussed setting up an outpost on patji for years, but he had previously warned them and their unqualified ""trappers"" away from attempting to do so. he followed tracks into the jungle, believing that the company had somehow hired a trapper with some skill from the pantheon, but he eventually found vathi caught in one of his traps and realized that the tracks were hers. vathi revealed the scope of the company's expedition and mentioned that there was a great deal of demand for aviar on the mainland. she also told dusk that the company had been in contact with the spacefaring ones above and possessed several pieces of their technology. the technology was far more advanced than anything the eelakin had developed on their own and included machines that could locate aviar. one of the other members of the expedition, winds, opened the largest of these machines and it agitated all of the aviar on the island. contemplating the new technologies and the suspicious level of interest that the ones above displayed in regards to the aviar, dusk realized that the machines were intentionally left with the eelakin to accelerate the progress of their civilization. this would allow the ones above to appropriate the resources of first of the sun without technically exploiting the native people. the fate of the expedition after that point is not known. notes[edit]"
Deepwalker,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Deepwalker,"""“ it passed directly underneath. sak chirped quietly from dusk’s shoulder; the second bird seemed to have some sense of the danger. creatures like the shadow did not hunt by smell or sight, but by sensing the minds of prey. ”- dusk, about shadows."" a deepwalker, also called shadow, is a large sea-dwelling predatory creature on first of the sun, only living in the waters near the pantheon.. like many creatures native to the pantheon, it hunts by sensing minds of other living creatures, making protection bestowed by mind-shielding aviar essential for unarmed boats. they hunt in the open sea, but are also capable of exploding out of the water to devour prey on the beach. they only seek larger prey, not bothering themselves with smaller food like slimfish.. a deepwalker is as wide as six narrowboats tied together, and possesses something like claws or tusks that are sharp enough to gouge rocks. the ironhull class of ship can successfully attack and defend themselves from deepwalker threats; they manage to kill one during the expedition to patji by the northern interests trading company.. notes[edit]"
Linji,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Linji,"linji is a figure who attempts to travel around the world without the use of aviar. presumably a figure in stories on first of the sun, it is unclear whether they are a historical figure or merely fictional. hoid is aware of linji's story and refers to it on at least one occasion. notes[edit]"
Eelakin,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Eelakin,"the eelakin are an ethnic group on first of the sun, indigenous to the eelakin islands. civilization[edit] although traditionally a tribal society, the eelakin have started increasing their technology level and moving away from their trapper heritage. this is spurred by the ones above, who have been trading maps and technology to the eelakin. aviar have always been important to the eelakin. otherwise, travel on the waters would be extremely dangerous. many of the eelakin are dependent on the trappers; without the aviar brought back from the pantheon they would be unable to function as they do. because of this, many eelakin wish to make a permanent settlement on the pantheon and subdue the islands like they did to the homeisles. this project has been headed by the northern interests trading company. the eelakin are ruled by a council of twenty chiefs. culture[edit] traditionally the eelakin worshipped the pantheon and practiced the old ways of being able to navigate the oceans without maps. they are lead by a council of twenty chiefs who elect on what they all should do. training for trappers begin at the age of 10 where they are sent to train on the island of sori. they are only allowed to graduate from this period of training after their teacher decides they have proven themselves, once this is done then they are allowed to select one of the islands to live upon and hunt on. this process can take many years. recently with the arrival of the ones above new technology has entered their culture and the old ways of doing things have slowly been dying out. notes[edit]"
Safecamp,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Safecamp,"safecamps are specially-designed shelters used by trappers in the islands of the pantheon on first of the sun. purpose[edit] trappers maintain multiple safecamps on the island where they reside. sixth of the dusk has three safecamps on patji. each safecamp is built to prevent deadly animals and insects from entering, although they are not completely sealed. safecamps are situated in remote locations and surrounded by traps to prevent approach by rival trappers. dusk and other trappers care for aviar in their safecamps; the presence of certain aviar also helps shield the safecamp from detection by predators that can detect mental signatures, such as nightmaws. trappers sleep in the safecamps, as they are the only locations on the islands where there should not be anything trying to kill them. only the trapper knows the location of his safecamps, unless he is training an apprentice. trappers carry notebooks that detail the locations of their safecamps and any traps around them; if they die, they want another trapper to be able to find and care for their aviar. features[edit] safecamps have basic living supplies such as blankets and tableware, and may also be used to store other supplies such as antivenom. one of dusk's safecamps is a single room-structure built in a gurratree to avoid terrestrial predators. it has netted windows, a trapdoor entry in the floor, and a ladder to another trapdoor in the roof. it is approximately four paces square and barely tall enough to stand up in. dusk's aviar nesting boxes are on the roof, where he maintains breeding pairs that can come and go freely. notes[edit]"
Mainland,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Mainland,"the mainland is a landmass (presumably a continent) on first of the sun, a planet in the drominad system. geography and ecology[edit] the mainland lies ""across the seas"" from the eelakin islands, but within sailing distance. the mainland's natural resources appear to differ from those of the eelakin islands and the pantheon. food on the mainland is more plentiful than it is in the pantheon; even trappers occasionally visit the mainland seeking provisions and supplies. the mainland also has animal species that differ from those found on the islands. it does not have the deadly beasts of the pantheon such as deepwalkers and nightmaws, and vathi was able to immediately identify sak as a mainlander bird species. history[edit] little is known about the mainland outside of its interactions with the residents of the eelakin islands. the eelakin people were once simple wayfinders. over time, the islands were ""tamed"" and their society became industrialized (with the notable exception of trappers who still live in the pantheon). as eelakin society progressed, the residents had increased contact with the mainlanders. many eelakin began using mainlander names for their children instead of traditional names. one of the notable consequences of this contact was that mainlanders learned of the magical talents bestowed by aviar. they placed significant demand on the eelakin to capture aviar and provide them to mainlanders for sale or trade. aviar were formerly very expensive and rarely seen on the mainland, but prices began falling, likely due to increased supply from mercantile concerns such as the northern interests trading company. this increased demand even further, and the companies began working on ways to find and capture more aviar. notes[edit]"
Heightening,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Heightening,"heightening is a term used to refer to the different levels of power an awakener may attain. by obtaining more breaths, an awakener can increase their level of heightening, gaining more power and abilities. overview[edit] the heightenings, while commonly thought of as discrete levels, are in fact merely markers of a continuous progression. each breath gathered increases an awakener's power. for example, although perfect color recognition is reached upon the third heightening, every additional breath gathered before then will incrementally increase an awakener's ability to distinguish between colors. reaching a new level of heightening merely marks the point at which these abilities reach their full potential. there are exceptions to this, like color distortion which is unique to the tenth heightening. the number of breaths needed to reach a particular heightening is not exact. achieving a given heightening may require fewer or more breaths, depending on circumstances and the strength of the breaths which the awakener has gathered. additionally, very little is known about the upper heightenings as the only known people to have ever reached the eighth heightening or above are the hallandren god kings, vasher, and shashara, so the abilities associated with those heightenings may not be the full extent of their powers or may be incompletely understood. by the time of the true desolation on roshar, the term ""heightening"" appears to have entered into broader parlance in the cosmere, as the elantrian riino initially thought kaladin had attained a heightening, though riino quickly realized that he was mistaken and that kaladin is a surgebinder. first heightening[edit] the first heightening grants aura recognition, the ability to see the breath auras of others instinctively, and an increased life sense. this allows them to judge roughly how many breaths the person holds and the general health of that breath. for those who are rich enough to be able to buy breath from others this is where most stop, as it is enough to extend their lifespan by a decade or so and give an increased life sense. second heightening[edit] the second heightening grants perfect pitch to those who receive it. third heightening[edit] the third heightening grants perfect color recognition, the ability to instantly and instinctively determine exact shades of colors and their hue harmonics. it would act strangely with those with color vision deficiency, and supposedly similar conditions such as achromatopsia as well. the way that it interacts with it would supposedly be pleasing to those with the condition. fourth heightening[edit] the fourth heightening grants perfect life sense, maximizing the ability to instinctively sense other people around you, and to tell when they are watching you. users can also sense plants, such as grass or lichen. life sense can also sense spren, even if they are invisible. drabs are not detectable, though. anyone with breath has some quantity of life sense, but it is imperfect until the fourth heightening. if an aviar like kokerlii were nearby, it would interfere with the awakener's life sense. copperclouds, a feruchemist filling a nicrosilmind with their investiture fully, and aluminum can also block life sense. fifth heightening[edit] the fifth heightening grants agelessness; an awakener's resistance to aging and disease reaches its maximum strength. these persons are immune to most toxins (including the effects of alcohol) and most physical ailments (such as headaches, diseases, and organ failure). the person no longer ages and becomes functionally immortal. note: returned achieve the fifth heightening by virtue of their divine breath. they do not actually receive two thousand breaths when they return, but instead receive a single, powerful breath, which brings with it the powers of the first five heightenings. sixth heightening[edit] the sixth heightening grants instinctive awakening, the ability to immediately understand and use basic awakening commands without training or practice. more difficult commands are easier for them to master and to discover. seventh heightening[edit] the seventh heightening grants invested breath recognition, the ability to recognize the auras of objects, and can tell when something has been invested with breath via awakening. note: reaching above the sixth heightening is incredibly rare, and so few people understand the powers of the seventh heightening and above. very little research has been done. eighth heightening[edit] the eighth heightening grants command breaking, the ability to instinctively override commands in other invested objects, including lifeless. this requires concentration and leaves the awakener exhausted. since some of lightsong's priests can break commands, it is obvious that the eighth heightening is not required in the process, but most likely grants a significant increase in the ability. note: the only known people ever to reach the eighth heightening and above are the hallandren god kings, vasher, and shashara, although xisis is known to have the tenth heightening. ninth heightening[edit] the ninth heightening grants greater awakening, the ability to awaken stone and steel, which create type iv biochromatic entities like nightblood, though doing so requires large investitures of breath and specialized commands. this ability has not been widely studied. the ninth heightening also grants audible command, the ability to awaken objects that they are not physically touching, but that are within the sound of their voice. tenth heightening[edit] the tenth heightening grants color distortion, the natural and intrinsic ability to bend light around white objects within their biochroma, creating colors from them as if from a prism. it is unclear if these colors can be used to fuel awakening. the tenth heightening also grants perfect invocation, the ability to draw more color from the objects awakeners use to fuel their art. this leaves objects drained to white, rather than grey. combined with the color distortion, an awakener can create quite a stunning view. white objects cannot be be drained to grey. a third ability granted is the ability to give commands mentally, called mental command, although this is said to be difficult to learn. this is the ability that allowed the god kings of hallandren to pass on their breaths after their tongues were removed. there are rumors of other powers granted by the tenth heightening which are not understood or have not been made known by those who have achieved it. trivia[edit] - the way having more breaths makes a person experience the world around them more vividly is partially inspired by the similar effect achieved by channelers from the - . - the effects of various heightenings can be replicated through merely being highly invested, such as by holding a - . notes[edit]"
Krell (cosmere),https://coppermind.net/wiki/Krell_(cosmere),"krell are a species of animal found on the island of patji on first of the sun. the krell's appearance is unknown. their natural predators include nightmaws, which hunt them on land, and deepwalkers that attack them when they are near the shore. the creatures are likely herbivorous, feeding on oceanside weeds. the krell live together in herds and travel across the island on trails that they wear through the jungle. they often sleep beneath the roosts of aviar in order to hide their minds from predators, since many aviar provide mental protection. however, some of their predators have learned that if they startle the aviar away from their nests, they can again sense the minds of the krell. trivia[edit] - there is no connection between the - in the - and the krell on first of the sun, brandon just likes the name. notes[edit]"
Nightmaw,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Nightmaw,"""“ how do you escape them? you don't draw their attention in the first place! ”- sixth reflects on his uncle's training"" nightmaws are enormous bird-like predators native to the island patji in the pantheon on first of the sun. appearance[edit] ""“it looked like a bird - in the same way that a wolf looked like a lapdog ”- sixth of the dusk."" nightmaws are bipedal quadrupeds, standing on powerful back legs that bear most of their weight; they look somewhat similar to feathered dinosaurs or giant birds. they have long necks and would be as tall as a tree if they stood upright, but they instead they lean forward in a predatory posture. despite their large size, the nightmaws are also very fast. a nightmaw's two clawed forelegs hanging low, tearing up the ground when they move. they have a gruesome head with a razor sharp beak that is as tall as a door. a nightmaw's skin is leathery and bumpy, like a plucked bird. behavior and abilities[edit] nightmaws are nocturnal. many of a nightmaw's normal senses are relatively dull, as they are almost completely deaf and blind; however, their sense of smell is incredible, and they have the ability to track minds by detecting the cognitive aspects of their prey. this makes them deadly predators. they are also clever, for beasts; in fact, some think nightmaws have begun to realize that humans make use of the mind-shielding aviar and can only be tracked by scent. when out at night, a trapper's only options are to avoid them or die. nightmaws' thick skin is nearly impervious to regular bladed weapons, although it is vulnerable to larger gunpowder-based weapons such as vathi's spear cannon. the nightmaw's skill at hunting makes it the apex predator on at least patji, although it is uncertain if they exist on any of the other islands of the pantheon. nightmaws call out with a horrible screech when they detect prey or are attempting to scare their prey. one of their chief prey are herds of krell, which often sleep beneath aviar nests to keep their minds hidden from the nightmaws. a nightmaw's screech can scare away the nesting aviar, revealing the locations of the sleeping krell. a dying nightmaw may also screech in a different way, quieter but more horrible and chilling, which may call other nearby nightmaws. history[edit] when vathi and sixth of the dusk crossed patji at night to prevent employees of the northern interests trading company from engaging the machine from the ones above, a nightmaw came across their trail. it followed them, bursting out of the trees and surprising them. however, vathi shot it with her spear cannon, mortally wounding it. in its death throes, its call attracted other nightmaws from across the island. dusk and vathi fled up the canyon to patji's eye, pursued by the other nightmaws. trapped in the pool, vathi and sixth lashed one of the blooming flowers from patji's fingers to a spear and fired it from the gun. as the flowers mimic a cognitive aspect, the nightmaws were distracted by the flower and followed it away, allowing dusk and vathi to escape. notes[edit]"
Mirris,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Mirris,"mirris is an aviar on first of the sun. she is owned by vathi. appearance and personality[edit] mirris is about three fists tall, like most aviar. she has subdued white and green plumage, and sixth of the dusk refers to her breed as a ""streamer"". streamers are native to some islands of the pantheon, although patji is not one of them. mirris seems reserved towards strangers, and hisses at both dusk and kokerlii. vathi sometimes comforts her by making clicking sounds. attributes and abilities[edit] mirris is vathi's only aviar and the two are bonded; vathi is surprised to learn that a human can bond multiple aviar. like kokerlii, mirris's aviar ""talent"" is the the ability to conceal mental activity in her immediate vicinity. this ability allows vathi to evade the many predators on patji that hunt by sensing thoughts. it is likely that mirris would also be able to conceal the use of some forms of investiture. her wings are not clipped. history[edit] vathi worked for the northern interests trading company and brought mirris with her on an expedition to patji. the two joined a scout team searching for a site to place a fortress, but despite mirris's presence, a deepwalker destroyed the rest of the team. vathi subsequently decided that she must find a trapper to have any chance of survival and she and mirris headed into the jungle. mirris was injured when she and vathi fell after a ""monster"" attacked them; vathi ended up caught in a jellywire net. dusk found them and was pleased to note that vathi knew how to apply some first aid to mirris. however, dusk believed that mirris's wing was broken and brought the pair back to his safecamp, where he cleaned mirris's wound, wrapped her wings to prevent flight, and placed her with his other aviar to calm her down. because of her injury, mirris remained in the safecamp when dusk and vathi left in order to investigate the company's activities. notes[edit]"
Deathant,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Deathant,"deathants are a form of insect native to the pantheon islands on first of the sun. one bite from these yellow creatures is enough to kill a person, even though they are only as small as a pinhead. behavior[edit] they usually live in underground nests that can sometimes be recognized by a bulge in the ground. when something disturbs their nest, they swarm out through cracks in the ground, making an audible hissing noise, and attack the source of the disturbance. larger nests may have permanent cracks that allow for faster ingress and egress. trappers and other students of the pantheon's dangers know that placing a source of smoke near the nest entrance can inhibit the ants from attacking. deathants have some sort of ability to sense mental signatures like other predators in the pantheon, as dusk notes that they would not consider kokerlii edible. dusk considers them a constant, deadly nuisance since their small size makes them easy to miss-especially at night-and they are present almost everywhere on patji, including on leaves, branches, and the jungle floor. they can sometimes even infiltrate a trapper's safecamp, although this is less common. notes[edit]"
Trapper,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Trapper,"trappers are hunter-priests of the pantheon on first of the sun. trappers are ethnically eelakin. they are exclusively male, with the (possibly apocryphal) exception of yaalani the brave. they are highly specialized at living alone in the jungle, and generally shun civilization. there are a few hundred working trappers, and they are the only people who breed magical birds known as aviar. training[edit] from a young age, trappers are trained by an older mentor in the many skills necessary for surviving and succeeding in the pantheon. their training occurs on sori, the least dangerous of the islands. the pantheon has no settlements, and trappers must learn to be completely self-sufficient, providing their own food, water, and shelter. they gain encyclopedic knowledge of the deadly flora and fauna on the islands and how to avoid being killed. they also become highly skilled at tracking, detecting and laying traps, and breeding aviar. they also maintain the ancient eelakin skill of wayfinding, and are able to travel for weeks by outrigger canoe. the mentor may bring the younger trapper to another island of the pantheon as their skills advance. upon completion of their training, the trapper selects one of the other islands, on which they will hunt exclusively for the rest of their lives. communion with the islands[edit] ""“this is your fault, patji. we are your priests, and yet you hate us! you hate all. ”-dusk"" trappers consider the pantheon sacred ground, and they serve as the priests of the islands. once they choose a particular island to work on, they rarely visit other islands. they perceive a distinct ""personality"" in each of the islands; dusk addresses patji both aloud and in his thoughts as if he is talking to a person. they also pray and burn offerings to their chosen island. all trappers retain a connection to sori, where they were trained; they may sometimes burn offerings to sori, and are always welcome there. culture[edit] the first trappers left the homeisles for the pantheon ""centuries"" ago. they presumably experienced some initial failures, but eventually came to live on most, if not all, of the forty-plus islands of the pantheon. trappers live an exceptionally solitary lifestyle, and commonly go weeks without speaking. trappers on the same island maintain an aloof rivalry with one another. there are usually only a few trappers working on a given island at any time, and they very rarely see each other, preferring to stake out separate territories. they simply ignore one another in a direct encounter, but they will lay traps in an attempt to eliminate their competition, for reasons that even they do not fully understand. ""“why do homeislers feel the need to speak when there is nothing to say?”-dusk"" trappers are fully aware that they are in danger of death at all times while in the pantheon. they always keep a small notebook on their person detailing the locations of their safecamps, traps, and aviar for another passing trapper to find should they die unexpectedly. a rival will always find and care for a fallen trapper's aviar, even if it was the rival's trap that killed him. when trappers visit the homeisles, they feel like outsiders among their own people. the scents and sounds of civilization are foreign to them. they believe that homeislers talk far too much and stand too close together, and do not like how they often conceal their true emotions. trappers do not understand the need for scholarship and industrialization. similarly, the homeislers have misconceptions about trappers and the way they live, considering them eccentric and nearly animalistic. the council of chiefs who govern the homeisles seem to historically have had a nonintervention policy with trappers, although the desire to sell more aviar eventually inspired a change in their stance. equipment[edit] early trappers wore simple wraps and sandals and carried primitive weapons such as clubs. although the basic role of trappers has not changed over the generations, they are not afraid to take advantage of new technology. modern trappers use rugged clothing and steel machetes, as well as backpacks and other survival equipment. after the arrival of the ones above, trappers even began using new innovations like diving masks, compasses, and sea charts. trappers travel to the homeisles or even the mainland in order to purchase supplies and equipment. safecamps[edit] trappers usually maintain several safecamps around their chosen island as living quarters, each of which are heavily booby-trapped to keep rival trappers or other interlopers at bay. safecamps are usually small treehouses with netted windows, equipped with lanterns, blankets, and cooking utensils. they are sealed as tightly as possible to prevent animals from getting inside, but they cannot keep insects and arachnids out. aviar boxes are also located in one or more of each trapper's safecamps. aviar[edit] perhaps the most important knowledge that a trapper possesses is the ability to trap and breed aviar. they are well versed in aviar behavior and anatomy, and they raise the birds in their safecamps from the time that they are chicks. aviar raised by humans become accustomed to their presence, and will return to their nesting boxes even though they usually have the freedom to come and go as they please. the aviar are raised in nesting pairs and the trapper tends to their chicks when they hatch. trappers also seek wild chicks, but doing so is far less efficient than breeding them. ""“it was a thing that trappers knew. you could not capture a bird before it had visited patji. otherwise it would be able to bestow no talent. ”-dusk"" trappers are the only people that understand the source of ""talents"", or supernatural powers, that can be granted by aviar. they are familiar with patji's eye, although they almost never visit it themselves and are likely unaware of its true nature. information regarding aviar talents and patji's fingers are closely held secrets among trappers. trappers also have the unique capability to form bonds with multiple aviar companions instead of just one. they consider all of their aviar special, but their companions grant them talents and travel with them nearly everywhere they go; an aviar with mental shielding abilities such as kokerlii is nearly indispensable due to the many predators in the pantheon than can read minds. additional aviar can grant other magical talents that help the trapper survive. trappers become highly familiar with the personalities of their companions, and can train them to perform certain tasks. aviar also serve as the sole source of income for trappers. they bring chicks to market in the homeisles or the mainland. because of the danger of the pantheon and the relatively low number of trappers, aviar chicks have historically been very expensive. however, technological innovations largely sourced from the ones above have allowed more chicks to make it to market, reducing their price even as demand has increased. mercantile concerns such as the northern interests trading company have sought to establish a presence in the pantheon to try and capture aviar themselves, despite warnings from trappers. notes[edit]"
Ones Above,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ones_Above,"the ones above is the colloquial name for a spacefaring group that regularly visits the eelakin people on first of the sun. their name references the fact that they arrived in the sky above first of the sun in spaceships. characteristics[edit] vathi, who has met some of the ones above in person, notes that ""they look like us; at times they talk like us"". this indicates that they are (or can appear) human and that some individuals may be able to speak the eelakin language. vathi also says that they have their own language when describing a translator device and an equipment manual. vathi suspects that they are immortal, until she sees one individual appear to choke to death. the ones above are fascinated with the aviar; vathi believes that they want to acquire them. however, the ones above seem to be bound by certain laws preventing them from simply invading the islands or even trading with less advanced cultures. they don't explain these laws to the eelakin, but they insinuate that they know of other space-faring peoples that would not face similar restrictions. technology[edit] the native people of first of the sun were traditionally sailors and wayfinders who used outrigger canoes to navigate the eelakin islands and the pantheon. vathi says that they had barely worked out marine propulsion on their own. the ones above have technology that is far superior to anything found on the planet before their arrival. they visit first of the sun through interplanetary space travel. they give some of their technology to the eelakin, typically without an explanation of how it works. - (and presumably other trappers) use sea charts created by the ones above that are more accurate than any that they can create themselves. - vathi uses a handheld device that is both a language translator and a short-range aviar-locating device. - the - also possesses a larger, long-range aviar locator that can scan an entire island and print a map of any aviar detected there. aviar react negatively when the machine is activated. the company also has iron-hulled ships, cannons that can fend off deepwalkers, and gunpowder-based spear guns capable of killing a nightmaw. based on the description of traditional eelakin society, it seems unlikely that these technologies were developed naturally; however, it is not explicitly stated that they originated with the ones above. vathi tells dusk that he has not ""seen the things they can do"", implying that the ones above have demonstrated even more advanced technologies to some of the eelakin. history[edit] the ones above did not specifically seek out first of the sun, but there are ways of detecting intelligent life in the cognitive realm. this allowed the ones above to ""stumble upon"" the planet, but they realized that they could not travel through its perpendicularity due to the unusual history of a shard there and the exceptionally dangerous location of the perpendicularity. instead, they decided to safely travel to the planet via the physical realm. the ones above first began visiting first of the sun less than ten years before the patji expedition. the visits occurred regularly and seemed to quickly become an accepted part of the culture. the specifics of the meetings between the ones above and the native population have not been revealed, but they did meet in person; an emissary worked directly with vathi and others at her company. eelakin society on the homeisles underwent various changes that stemmed from the advances in technology. this included a new focus on education and industry, reduced interest in traditional names and professions, and increased demand for aviar, including new demand from the mainland. dusk believed that only trappers still learned the ""old arts"". dusk noted that companies such as northern interests trading had been looking to establish outposts on the pantheon ""for years"" and that the visits of the ones above were not to blame for their ambition. although both dusk and vathi were distrustful of the ones above, they both used their technology, like all other eelakin. the company's latest expeditions to the pantheon would likely have been impossible without the advances that originated with the ones above. the ones above seemed benevolent, but dusk and vathi ultimately realized that there had been subterfuge on various occasions that resulted in the eelakin rapidly gaining technology or making ""discoveries"" through planted devices or information. they theorized that the ones above were intentionally doling out the technology, quickly advancing eelakin society in order to subvert the ""laws"" that were preventing them from taking the aviar. trivia and other appearances[edit] some version of the ones above was seen in the cosmere prior to the publication of sixth of the dusk. since no other works take place on first of the sun, this means that they have been part of the storyline on another planet. chronologically, sixth of the dusk occurs near the end of brandon's overall plans for the cosmere. brandon has mentioned that his long-term plan for the mistborn series includes books in a sci-fi setting that include ftl (faster-than-light) space travel. based on this, it may be that the ones above are travelers from a future version of scadrial, however brandon has declined to confirm this. scadrians are not the only option, as there are other societies that would be capable of space travel by that time. dusk is also known to have tried food that originated on roshar. when hoid is telling the story of tress on lumar, he mentions visitors to ""your planet"" whose spaceships have a form of intelligent ai or spren similar to seslo. he refers to this phenomenon as spirits or ""speaking minds"" that inhabit the ships and can control many of their functions at the request of their owners. given the timeframe and hoid's references to the reader's seafaring culture, it is heavily implied that the intended audience is a resident of first of the sun and the visitors who possess these sapient ships are the ones above, but hoid does not explicitly confirm this. notes[edit]"
Northern Interests Trading Company,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Northern_Interests_Trading_Company,"""“we'll lose it all. we can’t fight them. they’ll find an excuse, they’ll seize the aviar. it makes perfect sense. the aviar use the worms. we use the aviar. the ones above use us. it’s inevitable, isn’t it? ”-vathi"" the northern interests trading company is a mercantile business on first of the sun that has an interest in settling and exploiting the pantheon isles for commercial purposes, namely selling aviar to people on the mainland. history[edit] the company had long had designs on establishing an outpost in the pantheon, but the area was incredibly dangerous. the lure of the aviar there was such that the company decided to ignore the warnings of trappers and move ahead with the patji expedition, partly to test some scientific equipment that it had acquired from the ones above. the stated goal of the mission was to find out why only aviar raised on patji had powers while birds raised elsewhere did not. they brought two hundred soldiers, one hundred scientists and merchants, and two ironhulls armed with cannons. once they arrived, they built a fortress as their main camp, then sent a small team lead by a reluctant vathi to scout the other side of the island for a location where they could build a second outpost. dusk found a ruined campsite that had been used by the members of this scout expedition before a deepwalker had attacked them. he was frustrated that they had not heeded his warnings and had come to patji anyways, sealing their fate. he later found vathi, who had survived the attack, stuck in one of his traps near his base. she explained the full extent of the company's plans to him. after an unusual event that disturbed all of the island's aviar, the two of them set out on a dangerous nighttime journey to the company's main camp to try and determine what had happened. ""“we found instructions in the machine... a manual on its workings, left there as if accidentally by someone who worked on it before. the manual is in their language, but the smaller machine i have... it translates.”-vathi to dusk."" when they reached the company's fortress on the other side of the island, vathi discovered the source of the disturbance: her coworker, winds, had opened their latest 'gift' from the ones above, a device which could track aviar on a large scale. dusk tried to convince the workers that their actions were dangerous, but his words failed him and he was ignored. a short while later, terrified, vathi came to dusk and told him that in that machine they had discovered the true intentions of the ones above. she explained that they had found a manual in their language inside the device they had been given by the ones above. ""“they may be cunning, but they have not lived on patji. we will gather the other trappers. we will not let ourselves be taken in.”-dusk to vathi"" when vathi used a translating device on the manual, she discovered their benefactors' true motives. she said that it explained the ideas behind the devices; with time, the scientists of the company would figure out how to make them for themselves. she realized that she and the entire northern interests trading company were being manipulated by the ones above. according to their laws, the ones above were not allowed to trade with a society that was on a lower technological level than themselves. they were therefore attempting to fast-track the natives to modernity so that they could exploit them for their aviar. vathi recognized that things were too easy and went to dusk in despair. he told her that they knew patji better than the newcomers and could fight back and defend themselves from the invading foreigners. assets[edit] technology[edit] the company receives various technologies from the ones above. one of these is a device which can map out the locations of all of the aviar on the island. this device has some similarities to fabrials found on roshar. they also possess a small device that vathi found with a member of the ones above who died while in their company. it can translate between their languages and point to the location of individual aviar. they also have firearms that use an explosive powder to fire a spear out of a metal tube. it is not clear if they received these guns from the ones above or if they developed them on their own. fortress[edit] they have built a large walled fortress on the shores of patji out of logs, with large wooden gates. they have guardposts on the upper walls as well as cannons to protect from approaching ships. they have two heavily armed and armored ironhulls docked at the fortress to protect them from deepwalkers. employees[edit] notes[edit]"
Sixth of the Dusk (character),https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sixth_of_the_Dusk_(character),"""“for patji would try on every possible occasion to kill him. ”-sixth of the dusk's thoughts regarding the island"" sixth of the dusk is a traditional eelakin trapper on first of the sun. he breeds aviar and catches and forages other goods on the pantheon isle of patji. appearance and personality[edit] ""“better to let patji claim rivals than to directly stain one’s hands. at least, so his uncle had taught him. ”-sixth of the dusk's thoughts on the other trappers"" dusk is calm, patient, but also alert at all times, for every step on patji must be taken with care. he rarely speaks and isn't used to being around people due to the solitary lifestyle of a trapper. he is also a practical person; although he loses some of the trappers' traditions by using creations of modern technology, he considers survival to be of higher importance. he has the unique beliefs and philosophies of a trapper. he loves patji and serves as a priest for the sacred land, but he also views patji as a vengeful father who constantly tries to take his life. as is customary, he is in rivalry with the other trappers and would set up traps in hope of killing them. however, upon encounter, he would simply walk away from most people. dusk has dark skin and long hair. attributes and abilities[edit] as a proficient trapper, dusk has competent knowledge of the spectacular flora and fauna on the island. the ability to identify the deadly lifeforms is what allows him to survive in the jungle. moreover, he uses these threats to his advantage, for example, setting various traps for his safecamp with deathants, nightwind fungi, and jellywire vines. he is quite capable in woodcraft, and is able to make a canoe in weeks with materials from the jungle. he also utilizes modern technologies; among his equipment are steel machete, firestarter and thick clothes. however, the most notable abilities he has are those associated with aviar. aviar[edit] one of the most profitable skills dusk has acquired is the breeding of aviar. while most of the aviar he raises are traded with mainlanders to meet the ever-high demand, two of the aviar, kokerlii and sak, have bonded with him and travel around with him. kokerlii has typical cognitive disguise ability, which protects dusk from predators that hunt by seeking out mind. this type of aviar is a necessity for eelakin trappers as mind-shielding ability is both required when traveling on water, where deepwalkers can consume a ship in one gulp, and traveling on land, where being found by a nightmaw or other predators means almost certain death. the other aviar, sak, has a rare and unique ability: its blessings, when bestowed, can reveal possible dangers for its owner by creating illusions of its owner's corpses that provide clues about an imminent danger in that spot. although dusk doesn't like to rely on this ability, as it might gradually cause him to lose his edge, it has proven extremely useful on several life-saving occasions. history[edit] he was trained from a young age in woodcraft and surviving in the isles of the pantheon, mostly on sori, the smallest and tamest isle. his mentor, dusk's own uncle, died during a trip to patji, and dusk became a trapper exclusively for that isle, as was tradition for his people. he spent much time breeding and raising aviar to sell in the homeisles and to the mainlanders. at some point he also raised a bird from the mainlands on the islands, sak, and she gained a unique mental ability; the bird could send premonitions of sixth's corpse, based on threats in the local area. along with kokerlii, sak traveled with dusk and helped him survive the dangers of patji. he was contacted by the northern interests trading company in an attempt to ask for his consultation and help in settling the pantheon isles, which he highly disapproved of. he was present on patji as they attempted to begin ""taming the island"" by setting up a scientific experiment that would locate all of the island's aviar using technology from the ones above. after observing a brief, but deeply disturbing glitch in sak's abilities and the panic of every aviar of the island, dusk questioned vathi about the current actions of the company and concluded that a preliminary activation of the aviar-locating machine had caused it. with this in mind, the pair set off to prevent the larger machine's activation. en route, they encountered a nightmaw and though they eliminated the immediate threat with vathi's new, destructive technology that excited dusk with it's potential, they were forced to run at a dangerous pace when the nightmaw called the rest of its brethren. the two escaped by hiding in patji's eye, the basin at the center of patji in which dwells the invested parasite that gives the aviar and all of the cognitive life on first of the sun their powers. as vathi learned about the truth of the aviar's powers, dusk worried that he had inadvertently brought about the end of the pantheon and his life as he knew them. when the nightmaws found them, dusk was prepared to sacrifice himself by leading them away, but instead made ingenious use of patji's fingers and vathi's cannon to draw the predators away. upon reaching the fort, dusk and vathi found out that the machine had never been activated at all. despite dusk's ineptly-worded protests that something was still wrong, vathi left him and entered the fort. in the throes of despair and anger, dusk raged against patji as he made his way back to his safecamp, despairing the oncoming loss of his world. sak then flew away, leading him back to a terrified vathi who had also realized the truth; the machine was a trap. just as dusk left aviar mating plumes to lead rival trappers to their demise, so the ones above were deliberately leaving seeds of their technology for the mainlanders in hopes of artificially speeding up their technological progress in order to make it legal for them to trade with first of the sun's inhabitants and exploit the entire planet. knowing that the mainlanders would need his help to prevent this terrible eventuality, dusk entered the fort in spite of sak's warnings of danger and his own hatred of such places in hopes of gathering other trappers and saving the world as he knew it. relationships[edit] vathi[edit] dusk met vathi after a deepwalker assaulted the camp of northern interests trading company and scattered the people. vathi fled to dusk's hidden safecamp, and despite her efforts, was eventually caught in one of dusk's traps, where she was found by dusk. although not competent enough to hide her trail, her survival skill still impressed dusk as she didn't fall to the dangers in the jungle. although dusk disliked her at first, as they traveled together to stop the company from activating the aviar-scanner, he found that he was growing to be protective of her, treating her like an apprentice. he hurt himself when saving her from another trapper's trap and even prepared to sacrifice himself when the nightmaws closed in. in the end, he agreed to help her fight the scheme of the ones above in spite of the great dangers. uncle[edit] dusk's uncle was his mentor when he apprenticed the ways of a trapper. his figure has left dusk with memory and guidance. trivia[edit] - dusk has tried - food, and he hates it. - the second story about him will involve him going to explore - . notes[edit]"
Patji's Eye,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Patji%27s_Eye,"patji's eye is an emerald lake on the island of patji. it is the home to the symbiotic worm which gives the aviar their cognitive talents. aviar come to patji's eye when they are young to gain their talent. the worms feed off of the fruits of patji's finger, which only grow on patji, and the aviar gain the symbiont by eating the worms. the lake conceals the minds of those in its vicinity, allowing them to hide from predators who hunt by seeking out consciousness. the trappers know about patji's eye and what the aviar do there, but they do not go there often. it is a natural manifestation of investiture and is much smaller than most others found in the cosmere. it serves as a perpendicularity in the drominad system. khriss notes it to be very dangerous, saying that all expeditions to the perpendicularity by silverlight scholars have not returned. it is unknown whether this is just due to patji's natural hazards or something less natural. notes[edit]"
Sak,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sak,"sak is a bird that lives on the planet first of the sun and is owned by the trapper sixth of the dusk. she is not a member of any the species known to the eelakin as aviar, but she becomes an aviar after coming to patji and gaining a magical talent. appearance and personality[edit] sak has black plumage and is of average size for an aviar, about three fists tall (ten to twelve inches). she walks with a limp and has scars on her left wing that make it difficult for her to fly; she is almost always found perching on dusk's shoulder. she and kokerlii are dusk's primary companions and have nesting boxes in his safecamps. dusk is highly attuned to the behavior of his birds and is usually able to ascertain their emotions through their chirps, bites, and body language. sak is reserved and solemn compared to kokerlii. she does not chirp or squawk as often as kokerlii, and usually only does so if she senses danger. she will nestle into dusk's hair when she is scared, and he scratches her neck to comfort her. attributes and abilities[edit] sak bestows the ability to see visions showing possible deaths in near future (roughly a minute). these visions manifest in the form of an image of the individual's corpse in the area where a death could happen. dusk speculates that this ability cannot forebode dangers that wouldn't leave a body. she has control over when she shares this ability, and with whom. she is only shown bestowing the talent on one person at a time; the aviar must form a connection with each person to share the talent, although this bond is not as strong as similar bonds on other planets. sak herself seems to see the visions, as she sometimes chirps or squawks to warn dusk when they are present. she is the only known aviar with this talent. sak's talent is related to the allomantic effects of electrum and atium, in that it works by reading an individual's spiritual connections and possibilities. sak seems to have some understanding of verbal commands, as dusk tells her to show vathi the visions, and she immediately does so. she is able to fly, but only for very short distances due to her injured wing. history[edit] sak's species is native to the mainland. however, she was taken to the island of patji by sixth of the dusk as a chick, likely due to her injured wing. at some point, dusk brought sak to patji's eye, where young aviar eat parasites that live in the fruit of patji's finger trees and gain various magical powers. sak eats the parasites and becomes the first known example of a mainland bird gaining a talent. dusk learns that sak has a previously unknown talent that grants limited precognition; he sees his own corpse anywhere that there is impending danger (such as a trap, sinkhole, or a poisonous insect). this makes sak invaluable since the islands of the pantheon are incredibly dangerous. dusk almost always has both sak and kokerlii with him in order to survive. dusk keeps sak secret for many years, even leaving her behind when he traveled away from patji in order to avoid questions. when he encounters vathi, she identifies sak as a mainland species; she is confused as to why dusk carries her, as she assumes that sak is not an aviar. vathi later discovers that trappers often have multiple aviar, and dusk reveals sak's talent and her history. vathi is shocked and excited to learn that any bird can gain a talent, and notes that no new aviar species or talents have been discovered in centuries. when the northern interests trading company opens an aviar detection machine given to them by the ones above, all of the aviar on the island are disturbed, but sak appears more affected than the others; she seems to sense the direction of the disturbance and takes longer to recover. her precognition abilities are temporarily overwhelmed, and dusk realizes she is seeing the death of the entire island. after some time, sak is able to filter out some of the visions and resume showing dusk only immediate danger. she and kokerlii accompany dusk and vathi on a perilous nighttime journey through the jungle to the company's fortress. sak appears to take a liking to vathi, and flies to her after vathi recognizes the danger of the ones above. notes[edit]"
Kokerlii,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kokerlii,"kokerlii is an aviar on first of the sun. he is owned by the trapper sixth of the dusk and lives with him on the island of patji in the pantheon. appearance and personality[edit] kokerlii has bright red and green plumage. he appears to be of a typical size for aviar, which is ""three fists tall"" (approximately ten to twelve inches). kokerlii and sak are dusk's primary companions. dusk is highly attuned to the behavior of his birds and is usually able to ascertain their emotions through their chirps, bites, and body language. kokerlii chirps often and generally has a happy disposition; dusk characterizes him as ""oblivious"". like other aviar raised by humans, kokerlii always stays relatively close to his master and would not ""fit in"" with wild aviar. - images of kokerlii attributes and abilities[edit] dusk has not clipped kokerlii's wings and he is able to fly. since kokerlii serves as one of dusk's companion aviar, the two of them share a unique bond comparable to the nahel bond. dusk has trained kokerlii to return to him when he whistles. as an aviar, kokerlii gained a magical ""talent"" by visiting patji's eye when he was young. he has the ability to conceal all mental activity in his immediate vicinity. this is extremely useful to dusk because many predators on patji (such as deepwalkers, deathants, nightmaws, and tuskrun) can hunt by sensing thoughts. dusk notes that the power weakens as kokerlii moves farther away. this ability has similarities to allomantic copper and other powers in the cosmere, meaning kokerlii would be able to conceal some types of investiture. history[edit] dusk bred aviar and it is likely that he raised kokerlii from birth, although trappers also care for the aviar of their dead peers. kokerlii had a nesting box in dusk's safecamp, where he kept the rest of his aviar. kokerlii's talent was highly desirable to trappers in the pantheon, and dusk brought kokerlii everywhere he went. kokerlii may have had some understanding of his role, as dusk noted that he gave an ""apologetic chirp"" after a nightmaw found and attacked them. kokerlii accompanied dusk and vathi on a dangerous nighttime trip through the jungle. at one point dusk believed he would have to sacrifice himself to a nightmaw and tried to give kokerlii to vathi, but an alternate plan was devised and kokerlii remained with dusk. notes[edit]"
Patji's Finger,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Patji%27s_Finger,"patji's fingers are a type of tree native to only patji in the pantheon on first of the sun. appearance[edit] patji's fingers are massive trees, with large drooping fronds. each frond has a large blossom on the end, as long as two hands. after the flowers blossom, the tree produces fruit that falls to the ground. ecology[edit] the flowers of patji's fingers possess a unique trait. when they bloom, the flowers mimic the minds of an injured and fearful animal. this draws in predators that can sense minds, such as tuskrun, hoping to find easy prey. the predators congregate around the tree and kill one another instead, fertilizing the ground beneath the tree with their corpses. these are usually easy to avoid, however if a trapper happens by a tree that has just bloomed he can be caught by surprise. the trees also play another crucial role in the ecosystem. a large grove of a dozen of them cluster around patji's eye, where all juvenile aviar visit. the birds eat the fruit that fall to the ground and in doing so consume a parasite in the fruit, which grant them their abilities. however, a human eating these fruits will not gain any abilities. history[edit] the trapper first of the sky happened upon one of patji's fingers that had just bloomed and was killed by a tuskrun pack. when vathi and sixth of the dusk were hiding from the nightmaws in patji's eye, they tied one of the blossoms to a spear from vathi's spear gun. they fired it away from them. the nightmaws were confused by the thoughts of the blossom and followed the spear, allowing vathi and dusk to escape. notes[edit]"
Pantheon,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Pantheon,"""“these islands were sacred, the trappers their priests. ”-sixth of the dusk"" the pantheon is an archipelago of more than forty islands on the minor shard world of first of the sun. the islands of the pantheon are at least three weeks travel from the eelakin homeisles. lore[edit] each island has a name and personality associated with it. the islands are considered the eelakin's gods. patji is the ruler of the islands, also known as the father. trappers are trained on sori and, once finished with their apprenticeship, choose an island to trap for the rest of their lives. they are considered priests of the island. with the exception of the island sori, trappers tend not to visit the other islands. population[edit] these islands, unlike the homeisles, are only inhabited by a small number of nomadic eelakin trappers, estimated a few dozen, who maintain small hidden camps within the island. trade[edit] the islands are host to a number of exotic species, one of which is a species of birds called aviar who host a magical parasite that gives them unique powers. most notable of these powers is the ability to conceal minds from predators that are able to locate creatures by sensing their minds. dangers[edit] the pantheon is home to a very large number of extremely dangerous plants and animals. most notable of these are deepwalkers, leviathan-like beasts that live beneath the water and hunt the waters and shores of the islands. a large number of the animals hunt via detection of thoughts. almost all plants and animals on patji can kill swiftly. the smallest island, sori, is apparently more forgiving, but is still dangerous. known islands[edit] notes[edit]"
Patji (island),https://coppermind.net/wiki/Patji_(island),"patji, the father, is the largest island in the pantheon. it is located in the center of the archipelago. geography[edit] the island is one of the most difficult of the pantheon to gain access to. its coast is mostly cliffs and dangerous rocky beaches and, like most of the islands, patji is covered in jungle. in the center of the island, surrounded by a caldera, is a lake called patji's eye. patji's eye is a lake with a green tint, this lake has similar investiture to a perpendicularity but on a very reduced scale. ecology[edit] the island is blanketed in dense jungle. many of the most violent land animals on the planet are native to patji. most of the plant and animal life on the island have a cognitive ability that allows them to sense, or even communicate with, humans and other animals. aviar are birds that were originally thought to have innate magical powers. later it was found that their abilities actually come from the parasitic worms that the aviar ate from the fruit of the patji's finger. patji's eye is home to a parasite which infects the wildlife and causes the cognitive abilities. nightmaws large bird-like predators that tend to hunt in the night and screech when hunting. they hunt by sensing cognition or the mind of the prey, similar to other animals on patji and also have great sense of smell. their sight and hearing, however, are next to none. history[edit] dusk chose patji as the island on which he would exclusively trap, and set up a number of safecamps around the island. he bred aviar to sell on the homeisles and the mainland. at some point he also bred a mainland chick, sak, on the island, and she gained a cognitive talent similar to the aviar: the ability to predict the death of her companion, communicating this prediction by projecting a vision of their corpse into their field of view. notes[edit]"
Vathi,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Vathi,"vathi is a woman from the eelakin islands on first of the sun. appearance and personality[edit] ""“this woman spoke. a lot. people did that back on the eelakin islands. her skin was dark, like his, and she had the sound of his people. ”-dusk, on vathi"" she has dark skin and dark, curly hair, and is seen wearing a tight vest and green linen skirts. in the jungle, she carries a pack and her white and green aviar, mirris. after her journey back to her camp, dusk notes that she wears a new dress and ""smells of flowers"", although her hair still has snarls. she is born in the homeisles but her name does not follow the eelakin tradition, an example of the growing influence of the mainland. growing up, she was often told the story of yaalani the brave, supposedly the only female trapper ever to have lived. as an adult, she questions the authenticity of this story, noting that most cultures have similar myths of female role reversal that are actually used to reinforce gender stereotypes. she has an eelakin accent, but with a polish that indicates that she is educated, and she mentions having read books about trappers and the pantheon. she is intellectually curious, and she irritates sixth of the dusk with her many questions about his life and the flora and fauna found on patji. she is courageous and unflappable, and is able to react quickly in dangerous situations. attributes and abilities[edit] ""“she was not a trapper. a scholar should not have been able to do what she did. ”-dusk, on vathi"" vathi is knowledgeable, confident, and resourceful. with the help of her cognitive shroud aviar, she is able to move through the jungle on patji without being killed. sixth notes that she is fast and agile, and even believes that he is tracking a young trapper when he first comes across her path. she appears to a very high level of academic knowledge about the pantheon, and is limited only by her lack of real-life experience on the islands. she is able to figure out several key pieces of information even when she only has a few clues to work with. there are some indications that eelakin society is patriarchal, and vathi seems to defy convention. sixth assumes she is a scribe when he first meets her, and she surprises him with her fortitude and skill on multiple occasions. even after their trip through the jungle, sixth is still perplexed to see that vathi holds a position of some authority in the company and is addressed as ""lady vathi"". vathi makes note of her disdain for the tale of yaalani the brave and also mentions that captain eusto sees her as a threat to his authority. history[edit] the company[edit] vathi was employed by the northern interests trading company on the mainland. it is not clear how long she worked there, but she referred to a number of past meetings with the ones above. she had also previously met sixth on one of his rare visits to the company to acquire technology. she joined the patji expedition captained by eusto, although her interests were more scientific than financial. after the company established a small fortress on the island, vathi joined a scout team seeking a site for a second fortress. the scout team stayed too close to the beach and was attacked and annihilated by a deepwalker. vathi managed to fire a spear cannon at the beast; it had little effect, but she escaped into the jungle. mirris was injured in the process. sixth came across the remains of the scout team and tracked the survivors into the jungle, eventually following vathi's path which led towards one of his safecamps; unbeknownst to sixth, vathi had used a handheld aviar locator to detect the location of the safecamp, as she hoped to find a trapper and request assistance. she was able to successfully navigate the extreme dangers of the jungle, but she was not skilled enough to avoid being tracked by sixth and eventually got caught in one of his traps. meeting sixth of the dusk[edit] sixth was not pleased to find vathi, but he was impressed by her skill and her treatment of her injured aviar. vathi believed that the pantheon would eventually be tamed and revealed the true scope of the company's expedition to sixth, which angered him. something suddenly agitated all of the aviar on the island, and sak gave sixth visions of imminent death. sixth grabbed vathi and demanded that she tell him more about what her colleagues were doing. although sixth's actions disturbed her, vathi discussed her interactions with the spacefaring ones above, including the fact that they were very interested in aviar but seemed to have rules about trading with less advanced civilizations. she informed him of the large aviar tracking device held on one of the company's ships and she assumed that it was the source of the disturbance. through the jungle[edit] although traveling in the jungle at night usually led to certain death, sixth demanded that vathi immediately leave with him to stop the company from activating the device again. she declined, and sixth allowed sak to show vathi visions of her death, revealing that sak granted a talent even though she was not a known species of aviar. vathi quickly realized that sak was a bird from the mainland and had somehow gained a talent on patji. she also learned that patji's finger was a type of tree that had blossoms with a mental signature. she was shocked by these revelations and wanted to learn more. leaving mirris behind to heal, she agreed to travel to the company fortress. at one point vathi saw a mating plume from an aviar and grabbed it, setting off a trap, but she and sixth avoided serious injury. after he admonished her, he realized that he was treating her like an apprentice and opened up to her a bit more, even telling her the true meaning of his name. a nightmaw attacked, and sixth was dumbfounded when vathi was able to kill it with her spear cannon. however, the noise attracted other nightmaws, and the pair recklessly fled through the jungle, ending up at patji's eye. vathi was incredulous when she saw hundreds of aviar around the lake, and she deduced that the birds gained their talents from eating the fruit of the patji's finger trees that grew nearby; sixth clarified that the key was parasitic worms that lived in the fruit. sixth nearly sacrificed himself to try and allow vathi to escape, but they realized at the last moment that they could use one of the blossoms and the spear cannon to lead the nightmaws away from the area. return to the company[edit] ""“we'll lose it all. we can’t fight them. they’ll find an excuse, they’ll seize the aviar. it makes perfect sense. the aviar use the worms. we use the aviar. the ones above use us. it’s inevitable, isn’t it? ”-vathi"" vathi and sixth made it back to the fortress, and she quickly told winds not to activate the machine again, only to learn that it was never turned on - only opened. after considering some suspicious actions by the ones above, dusk and vathi realized that the technology was essentially a trap. the ones above wanted to rapidly advance society on first of the sun to the point that they would not violate their ""rules"" by taking the aviar. dusk agreed to help vathi foil this plan. trivia[edit] - some fans have speculated that vathi is a - , but brandon has confirmed that she is not an alias of - or another existing character. notes[edit]"

Community,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Community,"the community is a long term project devised by the set and led by edwarn ladrian. the project lived on after his death, under the leadership of gave entrone. the key intent behind the plan was to kidnap various women and men from the elendel basin and bring them to the underground city of wayfarer. once there, they would then be tricked into thinking that the ashmounts would erupt soon and make the surface inhospitable. the individuals kidnapped were told that they were chosen to carry on human civilization and that their 'rescuers' had to stage a kidnapping to prevent mass panic. in total, the project operated for five years before being undone by constable marasi colms. the original plan by edwarn had been to use wayfarer as a breeding ground to create a supply of allomancers for the set's experiments. following his death, however, telsin ladrian and gave entrone also decided to use the city as a bunker for loyalists to the set in the event that autonomy began their invasion of scadrial. notes[edit]"

Helaran Davar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Helaran_Davar,"helaran davar is a veden shardbearer on roshar. helaran is the oldest child of house davar, with four younger siblings: balat, wikim, jushu, and shallan. originally known as nan helaran davar, identifying him as the first son and heir of house davar, he is stripped of the title nan when his father disowns him. appearance and personality[edit] ""“helaran's grin was so wide, it practically glowed. it was hard to frown in a room where he was smiling. ”-shallan's thoughts on her brother."" helaran is tall, muscular, and square-chinned, although his father is taller than he is. of all the davar children, he is considered to be the most responsible and the only true adult, even after his younger brother balat comes of age. he and shallan are his father's favorite children. helaran is resentful and angry at his father, who he believes murdered his mother and her lover in cold blood. attributes and abilities[edit] his mother had intimate contact with a skybreaker acolyte and it is possible nale knew a member of the house was close to bonding a spren. it is believed they thought it was helaran. he was recruited because nale was impressed with him. they recruited him with displays of great power and shards. helaran had not yet bonded a spren and so his shardblade still had a glowing gemstone. likely, helaran was sent to kill amaram as a test-either that or he took it upon himself as a way of proving his worthiness for knighthood. history[edit] around 1168 or shortly before, helaran acquires a shardblade from the radiant order of the skybreakers. later that year, he visits shallan and brings her sketching tools from northgrip as a present. he had also given balat a new axehound pup, but balat had abused and possibly killed it. during the visit, he tells shallan and his father that he must leave to attend to affairs, but his father disagrees and confronts him. helaran summons his shardblade, threatens his father, and leaves, but promises to return and check on the family. after this confrontation with his father he visits the davar estate sporadically and for only short periods at a time, bringing shallan more drawing supplies but avoiding his father. of all the davar children, he knows the most about his father's secrets and plans and stands up to him the most. he has some connection to wit, whom he asks to deliver the message that ""he has eyes nearby and is watching"". upon hearing this, his father declares him disinherited and start referring to tet balat as nan balat, thereby naming balat the eldest son. two years later, he returns to jah keved and meets with balat. helaran warns his brother that this time when he leaves, he might not be coming back for a long time, and asks him to watch over the family. when his father finds out, he sends one of his new guards, rin, to kill him. in 1172, he appears on a battlefield in alethkar with a full set of shards. helaran's goal is to kill highlord meridas amaram, but he is killed by kaladin during the battle. although it is kaladin's right to claim helaran's shards, amaram betrays kaladin and claims the shards instead. relationships[edit] shallan[edit] helaran is protective of shallan. he encourages her drawing, as he believes her to have the potential to be great at it. after leaving, he continues to send her gifts, including jasnah kholin's book and high quality paper for her drawings. shallan looks up to her brother and feels that her rightness comes from him, from ""the best person she knew"". she wants to find information on his past and motives, but doesn't make much progress until after becoming affiliated with the ghostbloods. balat[edit] when helaran leaves the house for the first time he doesn't think balat is ready to lead their brothers. however, several years later, before leaving to the war at alethkar, he does ask him to watch over his family. balat considers helaran to be strong and brave and doesn't consider himself to be as good as he. when helaran and balat are together, balat ""puffs up"" and acts more confident. lin davar[edit] ""“there are more important things in this world, more important even than you and your crimes. ”-helaran to his father before leaving house davar "" helaran is sure his father killed his mother and her lover. he confronts him as he leaves his house. even though they don't see each other again, they grow further apart; helaran sends him a message stating that he has eyes nearby, and is watching, causing him to be disinherited and to lose his title of nan. later, lin davar finds that helaran talked to balat and sends a guard to kill him. trivia[edit] the reason behind helaran's attempt on amaram's life is unknown; however, mraize of the ghostbloods believed the attack was a strike against the sons of honor. notes[edit]"

Silver Kingdoms,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Silver_Kingdom,"the silver kingdoms, or the epoch kingdoms, are an ancient coalition of nations on the planet of roshar, dating back to the era of the knights radiant. overview[edit] the era when the silver kingdoms existed is called the silver kingdoms epoch or the heraldic epochs. there were ten kingdoms, each of which had a perfectly palindromic name - a reflection of the holiness of symmetry that can be found in vorinism. however, it's more than likely that those names predate the rise of vorin religion. each country had its own purpose within the war against the voidbringers, likely preordained by the heralds - for example, alethela was the ""protector state"", set up to preserve the arts of war and train people in case of a desolation. all ten states had their own oathgates within their capital cities, connecting them to the knight radiant tower city of urithiru. within urithiru, each of the states is said to have had a throne set up for its ruler. in the modern era, most of the silver kingdoms have splintered, evolved into successor states that lack continuity of government with their ancient antecedents, or ceased to exist entirely, with shin kak nish (now called shinovar) and perhaps aimia being the only known exceptions (although the scouring of aimia makes its current status unclear). most, like makabakam, have splintered into a number of smaller states, while natanatan has fallen completely, having been reduced to a small number of stateless settlements and a lone city-state of new natanan. however, the modern cultural, ethnic and linguistic make-up of roshar still reflects that of those ancient kingdoms, and many current borders lie along similar lines to those of old. many (though not all) of the splinter states that were once makabakam give nominal fealty to the ruler of azir, but these states are not truly united in a political sense. alethela splintered at some time in the past before eventually being reunited into alethkar under the sunmaker. valhav appears to have undergone a similar process, ultimately succeeded in modern times by jah keved. the silver kingdom of iri has been divided into two nations, modern iri and rira; it is unknown whether one or both of these states is continuous with the ancient kingdom. rishir appears to have disappeared entirely, replaced by herdaz, although it is likely related to the people of the reshi isles, which were part of its territory and which contain its oathgate. thalath's continental territory is largely ungoverned in the modern age, though it does contain the city state of kharbranth, but the island nation of thaylenah appears to be a successor state of some sort. like makabakam, the ancient kingdom of sela tales is divided in modern times into several nations; little is known about their relationships to each other or to the old kingdom. the silver kingdoms were: notes[edit]"
Dawncity,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Dawncities,"dawncity is a term used to describe a city on roshar that is old enough to be able to trace the origin of said city all the way back to the dawnsingers. as of 1173, discussing the dawncities had recently become fashionable among the alethi lighteyes. in fact, highprince hatham's wife studied the dawncities. au-nak believed that the city of sesemalex dar was a dawncity, due to the complex stone patterns that the city was built within. however, no city has yet been confirmed to be a dawncity. in dalinar's visions, he saw no sign of any of the dawncities. it is believed that they may have been created by the dawnsingers making use of an early form of stoneshaping to shape cities in the stone. they may also have been created with the use of surgebinding, although they are beyond the scope of what a single or group of radiants could create using the power of soulcasting. notes[edit]"
Punio,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Punio,"punio is a herdazian member of bridge four. he is a windrunner and one of lopen's many cousins on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] he is bald and muscular, and has the appearance of a fighter. he has tan skin and is identifiably herdazian. punio shares lopen's laid-back attitude, although he was envious that his cousin bonded a spren before he did. punio is kind and cares greatly for his family. he enjoys going out drinking and dancing. punio is close with his cousins and fellow radiants, lopen and huio. he once bet three clearchips that lopen couldn't eat 12 chouta wraps in under two hours. however, lopen sometimes makes jokes at punio's expense, such as mocking his hairstyling routine, and punio has privately complained about lopen's jokes to huio. attributes and abilities[edit] punio speaks broken alethi. he is married. punio is a knight radiant, a windrunner of at least the first ideal. as long as he has access to stormlight, he is able to heal himself. through surgebinding, he has the power of flight and several other abilities known as lashings. history[edit] punio was a member of roion's army at the shattered plains and lived in his warcamp. after bridge four gained prominence in the kholin army, punio heard lopen's mother say that they needed more guards. he decided to join them after returning from his annual furlough to herdaz. kaladin encountered him in the bridge four barrack and was not pleased to hear that he deserted his assignment, but lopen and punio argued that roion would not miss him since nobody could tell herdazians apart anyway. kaladin thought he looked like a competent soldier and grudgingly allowed him to stay, telling him to pretend that he was always a bridgeman. kaladin saw punio again when more of lopen's cousins, rod and huio, showed up in the barrack. punio's wife sometimes brought food to the kholin warcamp, although he initially told people she was his sister in order to fit in with the bachelors of bridge four. after kaladin began acquiring radiant squires, punio was cited as one of the few non-original members of bridge four that was initially able to breathe in stormlight. punio bonded an unknown honorspren and became a windrunner weeks after lopen did, shortly after the battle of thaylen field. when he began earning a stipend as a radiant, he sent most of it to his family to help out the poorer cousins, and a large portion went to rod's family. notes[edit]"

Bloodsealing,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Bloodsealer,"""“there was no subtlety to what the bloodsealer did; they didn’t traffic in subtlety. instead of skill or artistry, they used tricks and blood. however, their craft was effective. ”-wan shailu on bloodsealing"" bloodsealing is a manifestation of investiture practiced by the bloodsealers of dzhamar on the planet sel. much like the better known forgery, bloodsealing makes use of stamps to create bloodseals, runes powered by the investiture of the dor which can create a range of magical effects. however, that is where the similarities end. instead of the conventional organic inks of forgery, bloodsealers make use of human blood as the ink in their stamp. process[edit] in order for a bloodsealer to access the dor a few things have to occur. it appears that bloodsealers have to be dzhamarian. the specific processes and restrictions of bloodsealing, as well as any limits to its capabilities, are so far unknown but a few constants and hints appear. the use of a stamp seems to be required, as well as the blood of a human being which is being sealed. the bloodseals themselves do not necessarily have to be made from bones, but that is their typical material. the type of bone as well as the location that it comes from can be relevant to the bloodseal, but it is not strictly necessary. in addition, while human blood has always been used so far, it is also unknown if the blood of an animal will suffice to create a bloodseal. another rule is that the blood being used must be fresh, harvested from the person within the past twenty-four hours. after this time period, the blood grows stale and fresh blood must be used in order to perform additional bloodsealing. right before the stamp loses power, it will begin to dim, before pulsing and eventually vanishing. from here, evidence of bloodsealing is based more on hearsay and rumor than actual evidence. there is some talk of the usefulness of a man's hair, nails, and personal effects in bloodsealing. shai claims that they would not be terribly helpful in bloodsealing and there is no mention of their function or how they would be put to use. in addition to this, there are indications that the skeletons of specific people may be more useful than others in crafting skeletals, although again how and why are unknown. bloodsealers have been seen moving in an unnaturally lithe way. however, it is uncertain if this is a result of their magic or simply the unnerving effect their presence tends to have on others. it should be noted that the pale skin and hair are not a result of being a bloodsealer, they are simply the characteristics of the dzhamarian race. it is as of yet unknown whether the red eyes are a result of being a bloodsealer or another dzhamarian trait. it is likely that when crafting a bloodseal a symbolic representation of the shape of dzhamar, homeland of the bloodsealers, is necessary. uses[edit] wards[edit] one of the primary uses of bloodsealing is to craft wards used to imprison a specific person. the rune this process requires looks very similar to an eye. when inked with someone's blood, and placed on a door, the symbol begins to glow with a red light. the person whose blood was used also feels a brief sharp pain. if that person leaves the room in which they are imprisoned or attempts to alter the rune on the door, the bloodsealer that placed it will know. the blood used to craft the bloodseal must belong to the person who the ward imprisons. as time goes on, the bloodseal will begin to fail. the rune's glow will fade, pulse, and then eventually vanish altogether if it is not renewed. another, perhaps unintentional impact of a ward created by bloodsealing is to render an object unforgeable. just as ralkalest is incapable of being forged, a soulstamp will not take on any object with a bloodseal upon it. whether this also works the other way is unknown, but seems probable. skeletals[edit] the other known tools of a bloodsealer are skeletals. these creatures are skeletons that have been reanimated by a bloodseal on their forehead. while commonly crafted from human bones, they may also be made from animal bones, although these may be less capable of following certain commands. the specifics for creating these creatures, as well as where the blood used in their bloodseals comes from, are unknown. skeletals have the ability to track a person if they are given blood that was taken within the past twenty-four hours. the skeleton of the skeletal must be intact and if pivotal bones are damaged or removed it will cease to function. in addition, sometimes the bones may be sharpened, such as the vertebrae. this makes them even harder to destroy, as they will hurt the person attempting to disassemble them. repairs can be made to the skeleton with wooden replacement bones and while their stamps must be periodically renewed, they do not need to be refreshed as regularly as the bloodseal wards. skeletals are as feared as they are deadly. relationship to dzhamar[edit] bloodsealing has a specific tie to the land of dzhamar. like all selish magic, bloodsealing will decrease in power the further from dzhamar the user gets. culture[edit] within the rose empire[edit] ""“there are . . . times when one must accept the aid of darkness in order to contain a greater darkness. ”-gaotona on bloodsealing"" among the dhazmarians the art of bloodsealing is steeped in tradition. they have a number of specific beliefs that impact the way they practice bloodsealing, including their insistance on using bone for the stamps themselves, and their beliefs about the significance of the origins of the bones. while some of this ritual has impact on the magic system, not all of their traditions have an actual effect on the bloodseals themselves. as a whole, bloodsealing seems to be a controversial art elsewhere in the rose empire. it is only known to be practiced in dzhamar, who have not been mentioned to have any issues with its use. the grands, ruling class of the empire, seem to have a certain distaste for the investiture, but have displayed their willingness to make use of it over forgery. both the maipon and the mulla'dil or strikers have a strong and lasting hatred for bloodsealers and their magic. maipon see it as twisted and unnatural. the mountainous homeland of the strikers borders dzhamar, so there is also a lasting enmity between the two peoples. for their part, the bloodsealers also fear and hate the forgers of maipon. teod and beyond[edit] on a global scale, as of the late era of sel, bloodsealing appears to be relatively unknown beyond the borders of the rose empire. it is uncertain what if any attitudes there is towards bloodsealing in teod or the nations of opelon. it is possible that this is due to the diminishing returns on power often associated with moving beyond the borders of an investiture's homeland. parallels with other invested arts[edit] relationship to forgery[edit] like all forms of investiture on sel, bloodsealing uses patterns and shapes to draw upon the power of the dor. however, bloodsealing and forgery bear a striking resemblance to one another in the method. while the creation of magical seals is something they have in common, what the two systems seem capable of is vastly different. the whole idea behind a forgery is to build a plausible lie, in order to make both the cognitive aspect of an object as well as other people believe an untruth. however, this idea has nothing to do with the two previously outlined contexts in which we have seen bloodsealing used. skeletals in particular, being walking skeletons devoid of any muscle or flesh, seem to very directly contradict the plausibility requirement necessary for a successful forgery. these two systems at first glance appear very like one another but upon closer analysis they are still distinct, albeit closely related systems. similarities to awakening[edit] there are several notable similarities between bloodsealing and the investiture of awakening on nalthis. the most overt comparisons can be drawn between skeletals and the type ii biochromatic entities known as lifeless. both involve the reanimation of corpses to serve the living. both investitures cease to function if the body they work on is heavily damaged. in awakening, this twisted resurrection is fueled by biochromatic breath instead of the dor, but there is no denying that they are similar. it is, however, important to note, that while it is possible to reanimate a skeleton with breath, it requires much more breath and it would be much simpler to simply awaken a full corpse rather than simply a skeleton. indeed, the two processes are very similar in how they function, drawing upon an external source of investiture to cause the body to believe it lives again. the primary difference between the two is that the creation of a lifeless uses a part of the body's own soul, whereas a skeletal does not. the bones themselves are very important in the creating of the skeletal. the comparison with lifeless raises an interesting possibility. it may offer an insight into how a skeletal is created. lifeless are returned to life and given a command, which is a combination of a spoken order and a cognitive concept of what the awakened object is to do. if skeletals need a similar cognitive concept, it would appear the bloodseal on the forehead serves this same function. bloodsealing's other notable similarity to awakening is based on a lie that shai tells. she tells the strikers that the bloodsealer guarding her has been stealing bits of hair and fingernail from them to use in some ritual. while she claims that the bloodsealer would be able to do little with only those bits, the possibility remains that those pieces too can be used in bloodsealing in some manner. if this is true, then there exists another notable parallel with awakening. as per the law of biochromatic parallelism, the number of breaths required to awaken things is reduced when an object being awakened is made closer to the form of life, such as when blood, nails, or hair are used in its creation. if there is any truth to shai's lie, this is another fascinating parallel between the two investitures. known bloodsealers[edit] notes[edit]"
Forgery,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Resealing,"forgery is a manifestation of investiture on sel that is powered by the dor. much like aondor, dakhor, and the other known magical systems used elsewhere on sel, forgery involves shaping a specific form in order to evoke some sort of extra-normal event. there are many types of forgery that are explored in the emperor's soul, but all seem to involve the carving of a sort of stamp, the application of ink to the stamp, and then applying a mark onto the desired object or person. one appears to need an extraordinary amount of knowledge of the background and composition of the object or person being forged in order to make a stamp affect a target for an extended period of time. therefore, forgers probably need to be scholars and researchers as well as talented artisans. forgery is a cousin system to bloodsealing, which shares some similarities. prerequisites[edit] in order for a forger to access the dor a few things have to occur. one generally has to be born in maipon; ancestry there does not seem to be required, though it is possible that some combination of being of maipon descent or being born nearby and living in maipon at the time one gains the ability may also fill this prerequisite. however, not everyone who meets the geographical requirements can use the magic system, despite what some believe. a forger can forge off of sel if they bring dor with them, dipping stamps in purified dor, or making them with invested ink. a form is also needed, which is done with the use of soulstamps. most forgers are taught how to do mundane forgery such as reading people, writing, art, or personal signets before being taught to use soulstamps. though it is not necessary, these skills are useful when combined with forgery. soulstamps[edit] soulstamps are the main medium for enacting a forgery. they are used to stamp an object with a seal, which changes the object's past in a way described by the design of the stamp. the seal left by the stamp itself is also called a soulstamp. if the new history that the stamp implies is convincing enough the stamp will take and hold indefinitely. if not, the stamp will fail after an amount of time relative to the similarity of the histories. when failing, the soulstamp will evaporate and the subject will revert to normal. the subject will also turn back to normal if the soulstamp is forcefully taken off. a plausible enough stamp will stay nearly permanently. the more people who know of a forgery, the more likely it is to fail. there are power modifiers for soulstamps similar to power modifiers for aondor. universal stamps can be used on any relevant object without being programmed with it in mind, but will not last more than a few minutes. however, if imbued with more investiture, the period in which they last can be extended. they can be reused multiple times. soulstamps using invested ink can be used even off-world, bypassing the normal geographic limitation of selish systems. the seals left by soulstamps are slightly indented, and have a noticeable texture to them, regardless of the material they are stamped into. when a stamp fails, the embossed texture disappears, and the ink becomes as if fresh. while difficult, it is possible to soulstamp liquids. anyone can apply a soulstamp after a forger has created it. soulstamps will not work if a bloodseal is being used on the subject. it is possible to make soulstamping a corrupted investiture. carving[edit] in order to carve a soulstamp, one must have two bases of knowledge. the first base of knowledge is of the forms necessary to program the stamp. the forms imprinted on the stamp act like symbolic functions in a computer program, and it is necessary to put the correct forms in the correct positions to achieve the desired effect. the modifiers and forms required to encode a soulstamp function in a way similar to those of the aondor, though different shapes are used. the second base of knowledge is that of the altered history. the success rate of a soulstamp relies on the plausibility of a stamp to established history. while a forger does not need to know everything about a subject to create a stamp for it, the more knowledge they have on the topic the more plausible, and thus successful, their stamp will be. this is the reason why most forgers spend so much time studying various knowledges and mundane forgery. many simple forgings require very little knowledge of the object, its history, or pertinent topics. examples include reforging a table to be cared for rather than neglected, or reforging an awakened object to have a different command phrase. reforging things that are already invested is more difficult. materials[edit] known materials that can be carved into a soulstamp are wood, crystal, soulstone, and bone. it is implied that any material can be used as a soulstamp, as long as it can be carved to have the proper seal on it. the material used in the creation of a soulstamp affects the quality of the stamp, with harder, finer materials being more prized. soulstone is prized most of all because it is soft and easy to cut, but after being baked, it becomes very hard. the ink used to stamp the seal also has an effect - only fresh, organic inks will function, though they can be mixed with other compounds such as wax. clear, bright colors are the best. animal inks are superior to plant-based inks, squid ink being well regarded. given its relation to bloodsealing, it is speculated that human blood would be quite potent. it is possible that the suitability of the ink is determined by the original investiture in the creature. realmatically, organic objects have higher investiture than non-organics, and sentient creatures more than non-sentient. realmatics of forgery[edit] forgery involves the use of investiture present in the dor accessed through a medium of a soulstamp. the seal on the soulstamp acts as the focus through the specific symbols carved upon it. like other selish magic systems, forgery uses a series of symbols that represent linguistic concepts applied with a variety of modifiers to encode the intention of a given action into the focus directly. though the selish magics are often considered to use the concept of 'form' as their focus, it is more correct to think of these symbols as being a type of programming language using symbolic representation. a forger must detail their intent with the correct pattern and arrangement of symbols and modifiers. the dor is accessed through a connection to maipon, and each soulstamp carries an impression of maipon on the reverse. forgery utilizes a relatively small amount of investiture in comparison to many other systems. as such, forgers do not seem to be particularly invested in ways that manifest outwardly, like the highly invested elantrians or the dahkor monks. another side effect of this is that forgery has difficulty affecting invested objects, though the unusual nature of forgery has a number of loopholes available to it that offset that particular issue. the mechanics of forgery are not specifically clear, but it functions realmatically in all three realms, more so than many other forms of investiture. when a forger stamps an object with a soulstamp, the stamp is initially impressed into the object's physical being. a slight embossing is made in the object, regardless of the material, indicating that the impression is present in more than just the physical body of the object. likewise, the seal actively resists being removed by force, with a stronger resistance than the physical properties of the object should allow. the ink of the stamp is unable to be easily damaged, and does not fade or run until such time as the seal is broken or dissipates. it is probable that the seal impresses itself into the cognitive and spiritual aspects of an object. the nature of forgery makes it unusually realmatically aware. realmatics are in fact part of the core of the theology surrounding forgery.. shai demonstrates this by offering the most complete in-text definition of the three realms currently known. ""“ all things exist in three realms, gaotona. physical, cognitive, spiritual. the physical is what we feel, what is before us. the cognitive is how an object is viewed and how it views itself. the spiritual realm contains an object’s soul- its essence- as well as the ways it is connected to the things and people around it. ”- shai discussing forgery with gaotona"" soulstamping an object functions by rewriting the history of an object or individual to match the encoded intent of the seal. the likelihood of a soulstamp taking is dependent in part on the plausibility of a stamp. this includes both how the object views itself (the object's history) and how others view it. this is congruent with what we know of the cognitive realm, and suggests forgery is similar to soulcasting. a forger's technical skill of what they are imitating also plays a factor to an extent. it is also likely that forgery draws heavily on the spiritual aspect of an object, as connections that should be otherwise unavailable to the object cognitively affect the plausibility of a stamp, such as the instance where the room atsuko of jindo was placed in was modified in order to influence the drawing of a mural. the innate investiture present in the materials to carve and ink a soulstamp seem to have a positive correlation to the ability of the stamp to take. the amount of investiture present in soulstone is unknown, but forgery ink is known to function better with organic materials as physical mediums, with inks from more complex creatures (suspected to correlate to innate investiture from adonalsium upon creation) being more effective at aiding a seal in taking. forgery shares a number of realmatic similarities with other forms of magic. as with all selish magics, it is powered by the dor, limited by location, limited by birthplace, and encoded with symbols in a programmatic fashion. forgery is similar to soulcasting, however instead of influencing a cognitive aspect directly, it offers the change through the encoded symbols. it is theorized that the plausibility factor of forgeries is why a physical transformation from a forgery takes vastly less investiture than the more forceful change from soulcasting. the careful encoding also makes forgery more precise and detailed than soulcasting. the subtype of forgery known as resealing is suspected to work in a similar fashion to aon ien, and to a lesser extent other healing methods throughout the cosmere such as feruchemical gold or stormlight healing. the physical medium of stamps and seals are shared with the cousin system of bloodsealing, as is the use of organic inks. subtypes of forgery[edit] soulforging[edit] ""“ the forgery of the soul, that was what they considered an abomination. ”- wan shailu"" soulforging is a type of forgery practiced by the people of maipon, requiring the use of specialized stamps called essence marks. the use of essence marks is termed soulforging due to the fact that they forge the spiritual aspect of an individual. this is considered blasphemous by many cultures. the people of maipon practice forgery on their own souls, making essence marks which can be used to impart new skills, enact disguises, change their personality or physiology, rewrite their memories, or in general affect the history of a person in a manner similar but more complex than ordinary forging. essence marks are powerful, but incredibly difficult and complex to make, requiring a lattice of hundreds of different stamps networked together. using the power of allomantic gold is somehow useful for making essence marks. when applying an essence mark the seal will give off faint wisps of red smoke, which happens when a soulstamp is put on an living object. this indicates that the soul is fighting against the rewriting, and the color indicates that the forger is technically corrupting the subject's innate investiture. because a human soul is constantly growing, changing, and shifting, a soulstamp will last at most a day before failing. in order to keep the changes made to a soul, a soulstamp needs to be reapplied every twenty-four hours. if an essence mark is used consistently over a few years, it is possible that a person will no longer need to be stamped in order to keep the changes. a person constantly using an essence mark can have the capability to remember, grow, and change if it is programmed into the soulstamp. a person will barely be able to recall memories and emotions from essence marks within an hour of not using them. it is possible to kill someone using soulforging. however, this could not be undone, as the person would pass into the beyond. resealing[edit] ""“resealing repairs a body and makes it anew.”-an unnamed grand surgeon"" resealing is a form of forgery practiced by surgeons skilled in the art of forgery. this subset of forgery allows the practitioner to repair damage to the human body. it is also called flesh forgery by the maipon. while resealing can effect miraculous healing, even allowing emperor ashravan to survive a crossbow bolt to the head, it only repairs physical damage. after a traumatic brain injury like ashravan's, the mind remains empty, and requires the forging of a new soul to return the subject to functionality. resealing requires a great deal of skill and specialization. according to shai, a forger has to know everything about the body of the subject, including the placement of veins, muscles, and sinew in order to properly perform resealing. ""“ get a flesh forgery wrong, and people died. ”- shai"" remembering[edit] ""“ our workers are not forgers, we don’t use that word. they are rememberers. ”- gaotona"" remembering is a subset of forging employed by the heritage faction. remembering is limited to the creation of culturally historic objects; forgers are employed to manipulate common objects for aesthetic purposes. these restrictions are enacted due to the general disregard for forgery in the rose empire. rememberers employ methods of mass production to convert low quality goods into historic works of skill. relationship to maipon[edit] forgery has a specific tie to the land of maipon. like all selish magic, forgery will decrease in power the further from maipon a forger gets. the dor is accessed through a connection to maipon, and each soulstamp carries an impression of maipon on the reverse. it can be tricked into using the shape of a different location. for the same reason as the bloodline, the glyph of maipon cannot be simply changed to another glyph (such as aon aon) to allow selish magic users of another location to use forgery. if a forgery is taken to another planet in the cosmere, the forgery would collapse. forging can be done off-world if one uses invested ink, and/or dipping it in unkeyed investiture. interactions with other investitures[edit] with the power to change the past, forgery can alter almost any property of anything, including humans, to create vast and interesting effects with other magic systems. however, since forgery usually isn't powerful when it comes to raw investiture strength, it has difficulty dealing with heavily invested objects. doing so requires much more investiture than normal. elantrians[edit] forgery could be used to turn a person into an elantrian. this would require changing where they were born and then soulforging themselves into an elantrian, it also requires a very large amount of investiture to take hold. however, this would not give them access to aondor, which would need a kind of super push from aondor to achieve. however, this has lately been called into question. allomancy[edit] it is possible for an allomancer to start burning a metal that has been forged from one kind to another, but the process would disrupt the metal's spiritual nature and cause it to change back. because forgery changes a person's soul, a forged person's gold shadow would also change. forgery can be used to turn someone into an allomancer, with more investiture being required than breaking a surgebinder's bond with their spren. hemalurgy[edit] forgery could be used to change the properties and metal of hemalurgic spikes, but would require a lot of power to do so. awakening[edit] an awakened object could be reforged to have a different command phrase. surgebinding[edit] forgery can be used to break the nahel bond between a surgebinder and their spren. it can also be used to change the radiant order a surgebinder belongs to, though there might be issues with oaths not aligning well. this is easier than turning a non-surgebinder into a surgebinder, due to the preexisting investiture in that person and the basis of the first oath. a soulstamp's duration can be lengthened by a bondsmith. shardblades and shardplate[edit] it is possible to make a shardblade with forgery, but requires a large amount of investiture and is extremely inefficient. if a person broke a bond with a shardblade, a forger could rewrite their past so that they never unbonded the blade. if another person has since bonded the shardblade, the blade could be summoned by both people (only one person could have it at a time) since the shardblade thinks it is bonded to both of them. while difficult, a forger could alter how shardplate looks. forgery could also be used to give shardplate life or a robotic status. notable forgers[edit] development[edit] ""“what a fascinating mind-set. imagine being a king, deciding that you particularly liked michelangelo’s david, and so having your signature carved across the chest. that’s essentially what this was. ”-brandon sanderson"" the idea for forgery as a magic system was developed during a trip to the national palace museum in taiwan. while investigating the museum, author brandon sanderson was inspired by the east asian seals which had been applied to works of art by ancient chinese nobility who appreciated the works. they would stamp the work of art with their personal seal to indicate their approval, sometimes covering works of art with stamps of various patrons. this seed led to the concept of a stamp magic, soulstamps, that rewrote the nature of an object's existence. in order to not overlap too much with soulcasting, inspiration was taken from the setting of the museum. thus, soulstamps became objects that could rewrite history. as it developed, the seals grew to match the symbolic programming of magic systems on sel that had already been in development, and as sel had several pre-established asian-style cultures, the seal system fit naturally into sel's established background. the story of the emperor's soul grew from the starting place of the magic system of forgery engendered there, the national palace museum, and the asian setting on sel. notes[edit]"

Moon Scepter,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Moon_Scepter,"the moon scepter is part of the regalia of the emperor of the rose empire on sel. it was formerly on display in the imperial gallery of the rose palace. description[edit] the shape is similar to a chinese scepter known as a ruyi and it is pale blue in color, echoing the color of sel's moon oem. it has aons written or inscribed on one side of it. history[edit] the origin of the moon scepter is unknown. shai wanted to swap the real scepter with her own forged copy as a test of her skill, because it was the most famous piece of art in the whole empire. after an elaborate plan that also included the theft and forgery of a painting by han shuxen, she was betrayed at the last moment by hoid (whom she knew as the imperial fool) and imprisoned. shai assumed that the fool escaped with the original scepter and that her forged version now sat in the gallery. hoid did take the original scepter but its fate after that point is unknown. use[edit] translation device[edit] the moon scepter is not simply ornamental; it is a translation device between sets of symbols that are used to access investiture in the various selish magic systems. this is significant because sel's numerous manifestations of investiture are similar to computer programming languages. the scepter presumably has other symbols written or inscribed on it that correspond to the aons known to be on one side. a knowledgeable individual would therefore be able to use the translations to gain an understanding of the symbols that are integral to various types of selish magic. access to investiture[edit] selish magic is particularly powerful, but despite a common power source (the dor), each type of magic is usually only usable by people native to specific areas of sel. additionally, selish magic typically gets weaker as the distance from its homeland increases. these properties vary for each specific magic system, but selish magic generally does not work on other planets. this is a problem that some characters are actively trying to solve. although the moon scepter does not remove these geographic restrictions, thus far it is the only known object that could make this task ""less daunting"". someone that is able to use at least one type of selish magic might be able to use the information on the scepter to gain access to one or more additional types of magic (including aondor, forgery, chayshan, dakhor, invested potions, bloodsealing, and more). alternatively, the translation could allow the powers of a magic system to be accessed using different symbols in non-native locations (for example, an elantrian traveling to fjorden might be able to use aondor with dakhor glyphs rather than aons). notably, the scepter provides information about selish magics, but it does not inherently grant the holder access to any of its manifestations. the scepter is a piece of a much larger puzzle that could theoretically allow conversion between different types of investiture, even beyond those found on sel. the translation information on the scepter was the reason for hoid's interest, and he has already gotten what he needs from it. trivia[edit] - brandon has not confirmed whether or not the scepter itself is invested, - but it is unlikely since it does not seem to have particular value to hoid. - the moon scepter is likely to reappear in a future book, at least as a cameo. - sees a stick with unreadable writing on it in - ""trophy room"", - but it is not the moon scepter. notes[edit]"

Awakening,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Awakener,"""“biochroma is the power of life, and so it seeks patterns of life. ”-vasher"" awakening is a manifestation of investiture on nalthis. it is the art of combining color, biochromatic breath (""breath""), and an awakening command in order to animate an object, resulting in one of four types of biochromatic entities. it was discovered approximately 400 years before the pahn kahl rebellion. it has also become a generic term for the concept of using investiture and commands to grant objects sentience, regardless of the source of investiture used, though breath is still one of the main methods used. the process of awakening begins when an awakener releases some of their stored breath into an object through the use of a command. while doing so, the awakener must almost always be in physical contact with a source of color (e.g. a piece of dyed cloth). if the command is valid and is correctly visualized in the awakener's mind, then color is drained from the color source and the target object becomes awakened. it then proceeds to carry out the command. if the command is invalid or not visualized properly, the object can still be awakened but will have no effect. awakened objects can interact with connection, intent, and identity. biochromatic breath[edit] each nalthian is born with one breath. any person with breath can use it for awakening, though it's harder for a non-nalthian. other investiture can be used to fuel awakening, though the method on how is hard to figure out. one may choose to give away one's breath to another person, increasing that person's number of breaths. the more breath one has, the easier it is to awaken, and the more types of awakening can be performed. some feats of awakening can only be achieved once a certain heightening has been reached. - at the - (~3500 breaths), many awakening commands become instinctive. - at the - (~10000 breaths), the awakener can override the commands of objects awakened by others. - at the - (~20000 breaths), awakening inorganic objects becomes possible. - finally, at the - (~50000 breaths), the awakener gains the ability to drain more color from objects to fuel more powerful awakenings, as well as the ability to issue commands mentally. color as fuel[edit] awakening an object has the additional cost of draining the color of nearby objects. color appears to act as a fuel for awakening. objects drained of their color usually turn grey, although an awakener who achieved perfect invocation could drain objects more fully, turning them white. if this happens to an object, it cannot be drained from white to grey. while the color change is physical, there is also a spiritual change happening to the object. an effective way to prevent an awakener from using their art is removing all but grey or white objects in their vicinity. black, although not commonly considered a color, is very effective as a source of fuel for awakening. the dyes made from the tropical flower called the tears of edgli are very potent and are highly valued by awakeners. these flowers only grow in the jungles of hallandren, and is a chief source of the country's wealth. in most cases, the color of living things cannot be used for awakening. this is because the living soul interferes with the awakening process. the color of things taken from living things, on the other hand, may be used. an awakener can, for example, use spilled blood as a color source. if the colored object is small or the color drab, the command will take much more breath. colors outside the visible spectrum, like ultraviolet, can be used as fuel for awakening. fire cannot be used to fuel awakening. awakening commands[edit] commands are the focus for awakening. the commands used in awakening are crucial to its success or failure. they must be clearly stated, properly visualized, spoken in a crisp and clear voice without mumbling or slurring, and said in the awakener's native language. if there is strong enough connection to another language, their native language would not need to be used. awakening can be performed with sign language. many commands are simple, concrete ideas expressed in phrases of two words or less in the imperative mood, usually consisting of a specific verb and a general subject (e.g. ""grab things""). while more complex commands can be used, the more complex the command the more difficult the visualization of the command becomes. advanced commands tend to be jealously guarded by awakeners. in awakening, the exact wording of the command is important. an awakener could, for example, give a piece of rope the command ""hold things"" so it will wrap itself around objects, but this will likely result in the rope simply wrapping itself around the awakener's hand. the command ""hold things when thrown"" is more useful and only slightly more complex. incomplete or mumbled commands will take breath but create no effect. sometimes awakeners will intentionally do this or use commands designed to have no effect to store their breaths in an object. at the sixth heightening, awakeners can use basic commands instinctively and learn to use new commands much more easily. at the eighth heightening, awakeners can override others' commands, though this is exhausting. awakeners of the ninth heightening can awaken stone and metal with specialized commands, and can awaken without touching the object they are awakening. vasher comments at one point that awakeners at the tenth heightening can command without speaking, though it takes a lot of training. mental commands do not require verbalization, but many believe they do since it has never worked without one. those with the royal locks have a much easier time learning to awaken. basic commands[edit] breath transfer[edit] the first and most important command is the one that allows any human being to give their breath to another human being: ""my life to yours, my breath become yours."" unlike most awakening, this drains color from the user. this command transfers all of a person's breath at once no matter how many there are. an awakener can also use this command to store all of their breath in an object to be retrieved later, or to prevent being sensed by other awakener's life sense. an awakener can learn to split off some of their breaths, investing them into a place within themselves. doing so would allow them to only transfer a certain number of their available breaths. breath retrieval[edit] an awakener can retrieve the breath from an object they awakened by touching the object and speaking the command ""your breath to mine."" note that only the awakener who awakened the object can retrieve breath from it, though it is possible to awaken an object so others can access the breath. this command also does not work on anything that the breath has stuck to too strongly (e.g. corpses). a person who has put their breaths into an object and died can retrieve them if they have returned, but not if they are made into a lifeless. there are also tricks an awakener can do to use other peoples breaths or awaken an object so that others could access its breaths. if a awakener has no identity while awakening an object, anyone would be able to retrieve the breaths. simple commands[edit] simple commands are composed of a verb and, often, a subject. these commands do not take a lot of effort to visualize what you wish to have done. examples in warbreaker include: - ""untie"" - ""grab things"" ""hold things"" (used most often on ropes) - ""protect me"" (both vivenna and vasher are seen using this command on their cloaks) this command sounds simple, but careful visualization of what you want it to do is important. - ""attack and grab denth!"" (while this contains two commands, one can easily see the visualization for both being rather the same, so this is probably a simple command. on the other hand, vivenna is of the royal line and so awakening is said to come easier to her; this command may have been more complex than it seems) advanced commands[edit] advanced commands are often times whole phrases and require the awakener to visualize the action that they wish the object to take. the more precise the command the greater the need for that mental aspect to be clear in their mind. - ""upon call, become my fingers and grip that which i must"" - ""become as my legs and give them strength"" - ""fight for me, as if you were me"" other commands may be simple-sounding but require a greater degree of mental control such as ""fetch keys"" or ""find tunnels"". both of these commands appear simple, but the visualizations required are actually quite complex. the command given to lifeless at creation provides for the giving of additional commands (security phrases) without consuming extra breath. the command given to type four biochromatic entities, such as nightblood, takes on nuance and incredible power, becoming the core personality of the object. non-awakening commands[edit] awakening can be used for more than animating objects and there are different manipulations and manifestations of breath. vasher claims to know commands that can erase a person's memories, and he even appears to use them once. it is unclear how these commands work, but it appears that they can only be used on oneself, as vasher offers to teach them to denth rather than using it himself, and appears to teach them to misel after rescuing her from captivity. additionally, memories can be outsourced to breaths, though if the breaths are lost the memories are as well. they can also be used to alert the awakener of danger. there are limitations on what a person can alter about themselves with breaths. it is possible to make tablets with ""awakened predictive connection circuits"", which manifests as a list of suggested words when typing. however these suggestions are not always relevant. locks can be made that will read a person's intent and choose not to open. biochromatic hosts[edit] an awakened object, or biochromatic entities, acts as a host for the biochromatic breath used to awaken it. some types of objects more readily accept breaths than others, making them easier to awaken. receptivity to breath depends on the object's shape, its history, and the material it is made of. generally, awakening inorganic objects that have never been part of a living thing is very difficult, requiring extremely large amounts of breath. organic objects, especially those shaped like living things, are much easier to awaken. it is unknown whether inorganic objects shaped like living things are easier to awaken (for example, a bronze statue compared with a bronze sword). it is functionally impossible to awaken liquids. on the other hand, closer proximity to a living form makes it harder to retrieve breaths from an awakened host. for example, one generally can no longer recover the breaths one used on a corpse. if the host is cut or broken, it will not die, and will try to continue its purpose. the level of damage will determine how well it can continue. the breaths are also recoverable, but there could be some loss of breaths, depending on how the host is destroyed. there are places that use awakened objects as a source of energy and industry. vasher categorizes biochromatic entities into four types. at some point vasher had to change the system. he refers to spren as type one invested entities and describes them as power that came alive on its own. he adds that what he used to consider type i are now considered type ii. it's not clear if other adjustments are made to his system. organic objects[edit] the process generally thought of as awakening creates type iii biochromatic entities, a biochromatic manifestation in an organic host far removed from being alive. examples include awakened ropes, cloth, or skeletal remains. these are between the two extremes of inorganic objects and dead bodies. therefore, these have the advantage of requiring less breath (still more than corpses, often over one hundred) to awaken than inorganic objects while at the same time allowing for breath recovery. they have the strength to easily strangle people. the more it resembled living beings, the easier it is to be awakened, so a skilled awakener would prepare human-shaped and organic clothes for awakening purposes. an awakener who is not a human and has a different shape would have an easier time awakening something that is similar to them in shape (such as a canine making cloth into the shape of a canine). when awakened, it tends to mimic living things, forming muscle-like structures or shape of hand. awakened objects see similar to steel inquisitors do via iron and steel lines. awakened objects can identify the intent of people, and can choose not to perform actions based on that. they are understandably the most common type of biochromatic host entities created. however, other types of biochromatc hosts are generally more powerful. dead bodies[edit] when a nalthian dies, there is a small chance that their corpse will awaken in an apparently spontaneous manner as a sentient host called a returned, also known as a type i biochromatic entity. the breath given to a returned comes directly from the shard endowment through a process that is not yet clear. most of the time, however, dead bodies only awaken during the process of creating lifeless. these creatures are made via complex commands that reanimate a dead person or animal. these commands are guarded closely by those who know them. lifeless, defined as mindless manifestations in a deceased host, or type ii biochromatic entities, are non-sentient reanimated human or animal remains. they have a functioning brain, and are able to interpret old commands and have new commands given. type ii entities are cheap to make, even with awkward commands (used to cost 50 breaths before the manywar). this is due to the law of biochromatic parallelism. however, breath sticks so firmly to the construct that it is impossible to remove afterwards. once a lifeless is created, it will obey any instructions given to it that include a pre-determined command phrase (similar to a password). human lifeless are able to understand more abstract instructions than animal lifeless. however, the skill of the awakener who awakens the lifeless also affects its ability. any lifeless will retain a level of skill that it had in life. for example, a soldier's corpse would make a better soldier lifeless than that of a farmer's. the lifeless can function for a long time if cared and repaired. lifeless can withstand wounds, but too much damage will eventually cause the lifeless to cease activity, which means that lifeless bodies need to be maintained and repaired (e.g. by sewing its wounds shut) when needed, otherwise they are going to need a new breath. one innovation in lifeless maintenance is the use of ichor-alcohol, a substance discovered by yesteel that could act as blood for lifeless and that greatly prolongs their viability. lifeless created from bones encased in stone have the advantage of being extremely resilient and not needing ichor-alcohol. it is also possible to make stone lifeless by transforming a dead body to stone (e.g. via soulcasting) before awakening it. the discovery of how to create lifeless with just a single breath eventually led to the lifeless armies of the manywar. one example of a single-breath lifeless command is awaken to my breath, serve my needs, live at my command and my word. metal and stone[edit] type iv biochromatic entities are sentient objects made by awakening inorganic materials like metal and stone. this requires at least the ninth heightening. breath can still be stored in metal without the ninth heightening, but cannot be awakened. type iv biochromatic entities gain at least some level of sentience, however this might just be a side effect from putting a large amount of breath into on object. nightblood, a sentient awakened sword, is a known object of this type. it was created by shashara with the help of her husband talaxin, using a thousand breaths and the command ""destroy evil"". nightblood is incapable of determining morality and has a rigid way of thinking similar to a spren on roshar. the large number of breaths it contains also grants it incredible destructive power. the threat of more weapons like nightblood being created eventually caused talaxin to kill shashara to prevent the knowledge of this form of awakening from becoming public. the sorceress keeps an army of animated metal soldiers that she has awakened through unknown means. they are semi-self-aware and rely on their initial programming, but they can follow orders after being awakened. stone is presumed to be similarly difficult to awaken. however, lifeless can be made by enclosing bones in stone, making near indestructible warriors. talaxin used this technique to create the legendary kalad's phantoms. dead bodies soulcast into stone are also easier to awaken due to them once being alive. burning metals containing biochromatic breath has no effect on the allomancy, although if the breath belongs to the allomancer it will be regained. technology[edit] fort's tablets[edit] awakened technology is possible through the process of awakening circuitry; the only known example of such technology is fort's tablet, which is an awakened device that provides a dual function to fort. on the back, it allows him to tap letters and bring down a list of common words. these letters and words are then displayed on the front of the tablet for the reader or person(s) he is communicating with to see and read. the board is able to anticipate his needs, giving him likely suggestions-working with supernatural speed. in turn, the tablet is also able to hear and understand audible words from those near fort, and will then display them for fort to be able to read. it has the ability to differentiate between voices and will place a symbol before each voice, allowing fort to differentiate between speakers. this process of communication is accomplished via awakened predictive connection circuits. further utilizing connection, the device will only work for fort, as he mentions when he warns tress not to attempt to steal it. fort's tablet operates on a solar battery, which requires it to be left out in the sun at least once a week to charge, or it will cease to function. the tablet also has security protocols, although they are off by default. the sorceress hacked fort's tablets to spy on the crow's song. fort's second tablet, received from tress as a part of her boon in trade with xisis, is an improvement upon the original device. it can change between different fonts. it also offers more real-time-like communication, accomplished by allowing the text to disappear at the top of the board as he taps, allowing for longer sentences and fewer pauses, as he does not have to wait for the old text to disappear. additionally, fort's new tablet is advanced enough to allow for video conferencing. komashi machines[edit] the father machine and its prototype, created by scholars on komashi to extract hion from the hijo, was described by hoid as having been awakened with commands. the father machine was awakened using something other than nalthian breath, but the exact method is unknown. known awakeners[edit] trivia[edit] - in the - - , vasher uses the command "" - "" (instead

Lights,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Light,"""“if light is investiture, and all investiture is deity, and deity has intent, then light must have intent. ”-navani"" gaseous investiture within the rosharan system manifests as a number of different lights, each associated with one or more shards. these rosharan lights include the three pure ones - stormlight, voidlight, and lifelight - a few hybrids (warlight and towerlight being the only confirmed ones), and the anti-lights. characteristics & attributes[edit] although the lights of roshar come from different shards, they all share a few fundamental attributes, properties, and behaviors. physical properties[edit] all lights share some characteristics with regular light (i.e. electromagnetic radiation) and matter - specifically gases and liquids - though they are neither one of these. the comparison between light and light is, in some ways, the easiest to make - regular light cannot be captured in gems, and it appears to be emitted by any one of the lights (specifically, the lights allow the spiritual realm to ""shine through""). there are some subtle differences, however. when refracted through a prism, regular light forms a rainbow, with all colors getting an even share in the band, smoothly transitioning from one to the next; the illumination given off by the lights, however, forms a physical impossibility - a rainbow with specific colors (e.g. blue for stormlight) getting a larger share of the overall band. hybrid lights, such as towerlight, behave even more strangely - they split into two rainbows, matching their constituent lights. for example, towerlight will split into one rainbow with a wider blue band, and one with a wider green band, matching the rainbows produced by stormlight and lifelight. the similarity with liquids is more subtle, and manifests most clearly when transferring light between gems using sound vibrations, where it behaves similarly to the way liquids can be siphoned from one container into another (though the actual mechanics behind this are different). once the transfer begins, the light will follow the source of the sound, much like how a liquid will flow through a siphoning tube or hose. this parallel holds even when transferring light directly from one gem to another using the arnist method, though the process there is more akin to osmosis. and finally, the similarities with gases are most evident in how light behaves when it is not doing anything - it diffuses through porous surfaces, rises in the air, and ""evaporates."" interaction with gems[edit] all lights can be stored in gems. how long a given quantity of light will remain in a specific gem depends on the type of light and the quality of the gem. the rate at which a light leaks from gemstones is not constant either - it appears slow at first, but accelerates rapidly near the end, making gems that begin to dim, dim fast. regardless of the type of light, perfect gems are said to be able to hold it indefinitely, but they are extremely rare. light can also be transferred between gems. prior to the occupation of urithiru during the true desolation, the methods of transferring light - only stormlight at the time - from one gem to another were closely guarded secrets of the different artifabrian communities. the arnist method[edit] the arnist method of transferring light between gems is a procedure involving draining the light from a small(er) infused gemstone and moving it into several large(r) empty ones of the same type; the procedure is reminiscent of the movement of gases across a pressure differential, as light will naturally and passively leave a smaller gem and flow into a nearby larger one. the vriztl guild method[edit] there exists at least one alternative to the arnist method, and while it doesn't have a formal name, it is known to the vriztl guild of thaylenah - and it traditionally involves tuning forks and sound. if a gem can be made to vibrate at a frequency matching one of the pure tones of roshar, it will draw nearby light corresponding to that tone (e.g. a gem vibrating to honor's tone will draw stormlight in). to transfer light from one gem to another, the artifabrian would first use a tuning fork matching the desired tone, and touch it against the full gemstone, making it vibrate with the same frequency. the gem and fork vibrating at a matching frequency allows the artifabrian to lead a line of light from the full gemstone to an empty one, which - when touched by the tuning fork and also made to vibrate at the matching frequency - would proceed to siphon the light from the originally full gem, though a small amount of light is lost in the transfer. intent[edit] light, much like the shards it comes from, has intent. the full scope of the importance of this intent is unclear, but it appears critical for the creation of hybrid lights and anti-lights. the tones[edit] one of the most unique ways the lights of roshar behave unlike regular matter is in the way they naturally vibrate. each light vibrates at - and responds to - not only a specific frequency (matching the pure tone of its shard), but also to a specific rhythm. for example, when singers listen to a stormlight sphere, they can faintly hear honor's pure tone wavering and pulsing to a stately rhythm - honor's rhythm. hybrid lights, such as towerlight and warlight, complicate this further, as they have two tones (e.g. in the case of towerlight, honor's and cultivation's), somehow different from what they would be in the constituent lights, changed to be in harmony with one another; both tones adopt a rhythm, once again different from the rhythms of the hybrid's ""components"" - for example, both of towerlight's tones vibrate to the rhythm of the tower. the combination of a shard's tone and rhythm is sometimes referred to as the shard's song. the relationship between lights and their tones goes in the other direction as well. the same way the harmony of a light's tone and rhythm can be felt and heard, one can create this harmony using musical instruments, or even one's voice, and thus draw the light in. in fact, raboniel speculates that the reason light responds to sound, and the combination of a specific tone and rhythm, is because it is reminiscent of the ""voice"" of the light's shard. the vriztl guild of thaylenah, likely unaware of the realmatic reasons behind it, has been making use of this property of light to transfer stormlight between gems - in their case, using tuning forks matching honor's tone. opposite tones[edit] there exists a set of tones complementary to the pure tones of roshar, identical in frequency, but created and infused with intent. these tones, sometimes called ""opposite tones"" behave similarly to the pure ones, in that they too interact with their matching light (e.g. stormlight will interact with honor's opposite tone), but where the sound produced by the pure tones attract light, their opposites repel it. intent plays a critical role in the creation of these opposite tones, as they cannot be created by accident, one must intend to produce them, though there exists a caveat: an opposite tone can be produced mechanically, with a musical instrument and with no intent, as long as the instrument was created with the intent of producing an opposite tone in the first place. related to the opposite tones' ability to repel light is the strange way they sound differently to different people. for example, odium's tone and its opposite sound identical to a human, but to a fused - somebody whose soul has been heavily invested by odium - the opposite tone sounds uniquely unpleasant. naturally, since the opposite tones sound exactly like their pure counterparts, they can be made to be fit their respective rhythms; the same way honor's pure tone can harmonize with his rhythm, so can his opposite tone. this intent-fueled song is crucial for the creation of anti-lights. pure lights[edit] there are three primary, or ""pure"" lights in the rosharan system, one for each shard. stormlight[edit] honor's light has been a core part of life on roshar, both literally in the renewing and refreshing energy it provides to the planet's flora and fauna, and figuratively - in the numerous ways it is being used by people in their everyday life. it is delivered primarily through the highstorms, and glows with a steady white light, with a slight, nearly imperceptible blue tint. when its illumination is split through a prism, it produces a rainbow with a larger blue band. when drawn in and held by a surgebinder, it encourages motion and action. stormlight's - honor's - rhythm is a stately one. voidlight[edit] historically, odium's light only found its way to roshar during desolations when odium--or in the case of the false desolation, ba-ado-mishram--would supply it directly to his servants, provided they sang the song of prayer. since the arrival of the everstorm, it can be obtained much more easily--though it appears that it doesn't naturally infuse gems in the way stormlight does during highstorms. like stormlight, it can be stored in gems, but it leaks much more slowly--possibly the source of szeth's belief that the voidbringers can hold stormlight (in actuality, voidlight) indefinitely. voidlight glows with a distinct purple-on-black glow described as ""hyperviolet""--possibly the rosharan or alethi term for either ultraviolet or a chimerical color. when its illumination is split through a prism, voidlight produces a rainbow with an ""enormous"" violet band, dwarfing all other colors. when drawn in and held, odium's light enflames emotions, though in singers at least it doesn't infuse their entire body like stormlight does, instead going to the gemheart. its rhythm is ""chaotic, but with a certain logic to it."" lifelight[edit] lifelight, or cultivation's light, is perhaps the rarest of the three pure lights. some of it can be found in the valley, in the form of green mist. lift is uniquely able to produce it by metabolizing food, but no other ways of obtaining it are currently known. it appears very similar to stormlight, a nearly pure white light, but where stormlight has a slight blue tint, lifelight has a slight green one. when its illumination is split through a prism, it produces a rainbow with a larger green band. its rhythm is stark and staccato, but it builds. lifelight shares stormlight's effect on plants but to a superior degree, stimulating their growth when combined with the proper rhythm. hybrid lights[edit] in addition to the ""pure"" lights of roshar, there exist hybrids created by the union of any two pure lights. the methods of creation of these hybrids vary slightly, but at their core is the need for the appropriate investitures, tones, and rhythms. towerlight[edit] towerlight is the very substance of the spren known as the sibling, and as they are the child of honor and cultivation, so towerlight is the product of melding these two shards' investitures, tones, and rhythms. it can only be created by the sibling and their bondsmith, though the imprisonment of ba-ado-mishram rendered them unable to produce more than small amounts - enough to power only the most essential of urithiru's fabrials; a deficiency that appears to have ended when navani kholin became the sibling's current bondsmith. a key factor in the creation of towerlight is the sibling's ability to hear both of their parents' songs - cultivation's, which they could hear and sing on their own, and honor's, which navani had to provide for them. because of this, it is unclear whether the sibling is truly ""healed"", or losing the bond - and navani - would mean that they lose towerlight once again. in appearance, towerlight resembles both stormlight and lifelight, as it glows with a soft blue-green light. when split through a prism, it produces two rainbows of color, one with a wider blue band, and one with a wider green one. towerlight's rhythm - the rhythm of the tower - evokes the ""boundless energy of cultivation, always growing and changing, and the calm solidity of honor - organized, structured."" the psychological effects of holding towerlight are unknown. warlight[edit] unlike towerlight, which has been known to humans and singers alike for millennia (even if knowledge of it was largely lost on roshar after the recreance), warlight - the hybrid light of honor and odium - is a recent discovery, one that even renowned singer scholars like raboniel thought an impossibility. during the occupation of urithiru navani discovers that a human and a singer (or at least she and raboniel) can create warlight by allowing stormlight and voidlight to combine inside a gem made to vibrate to the rhythm of war - a rhythm created by the harmony of navani singing honor's song and raboniel singing odium's; a rhythm raboniel didn't know existed prior to these events, and whose emotional influence she notes will be of particular interest to el. it is seemingly impossible to create without both a human and a singer. warlight glows with a vibrant black-blue light, and its rhythm is a burst of chaotic notes, bounded by a regular, orderly pulse. when contained in a gemstone the light can be seen oscillating between swirling like a raging storm and then falling into a peaceful calm. odium & cultivation[edit] the existence of an odium and cultivation hybrid light hasn't been confirmed, but venli successfully attunes a rhythm of these two shards, so a corresponding light is likely. anti-lights[edit] physical matter is known to have a counterpart called antimatter - matter composed of antiparticles that share many properties with the particles of ordinary matter, but manifest some of them in an opposite way (e.g. a proton and an antiproton have the same mass, but opposite electric charges and magnetic moments). raboniel describes this in terms of axi with opposite polarities. a similar relationship exists between investiture and anti-investiture in the cosmere. anti-investiture - or, in roshar's specific case, anti-light - comes in a number of different varieties, each one of which shares some properties with its corresponding ordinary light, while exhibiting other attributes in an opposite way. most notably, a light and its anti-light that come in contact will naturally annihilate each other - with the reaction seeming more violent when the two are brought together under pressure, such as within a gemstone. this occurs when any investiture and anti-investiture come into contact, though the explosion is smaller if they are not both of the same shard. anti-light shares most of the physical and magical properties of ordinary light: it glows in the physical spectrum (though unlike regular lights, it appears to warp the air around it, almost as if it is drawing light instead of emitting it), it can be stored in gems, it responds to sound and vibration, and has intent. one area where anti-light differs from regular light - or at least the pure ones - is that it requires intent to be created, a property it shares with the hybrid lights. the only known method of creating anti-light requires dampening the natural vibration of its corresponding light, isolating it from its shard's pure tone, and then re-writing it with a different tone, one that has been inverted with intent. one way to do this involves putting the ordinary light in vacuum and allowing it to draw near a gemstone that has been made to vibrate to the tone of the desired anti-light - the ordinary light's opposite tone. much like each light's natural vibration can be heard or felt by different species, anti-light's can too, though its song is not just physically audible, it carries a magical effect too. for example, to a human the song of anti-voidlight will sound identical to the song of voidlight, odium's tone moving to his rhythm, but to a fused - whose soul is filled with odium's own investiture - the song of anti-voidlight not only sounds different, it also causes intense pain, similar to the discomfort they feel when hearing odium's opposite tone, but much worse. the type of investiture an anti-light is keyed to can also impact on its reaction to types of investiture, this can only alter the intensity of the explosion caused however. anti-voidlight[edit] anti-voidlight is the first anti-light to be discovered on roshar, initially discovered by king gavilar kholin not long before his death. his research into the lights of roshar and the ability to transport them between planets in the system allowed him to obtain a sphere of anti-voidlight, which he gave to szeth moments before dying. the sphere, and the anti-voidlight within it, eventually led navani to also discover how to create anti-light. anti-voidlight glows faintly violet-black and appears to faintly warp the air around itself. its tone - and song - sound identical to those of voidlight, but they induce an adverse reaction in the fused, and presumably in other creatures heavily invested by odium, such as voidspren. when made to touch the soul of such creatures, anti-voidlight reacts violently against the voidlight there, resulting in permanent death. anti-stormlight[edit] anti-stormlight was discovered by raboniel shortly after navani's own discovery of anti-voidlight. in many ways, anti-stormlight behaves symmetrically to anti-voidlight - except where anti-voidlight has a destructive effect on beings invested by odium, anti-stormlight has that effect on ones invested by honor, such as radiant spren. using raysium weapons, anti-stormlight is able to kill radiant spren, which breaks the bond between the spren and its radiant. other anti-investiture[edit] it is unknown whether hybrid lights or shards outside of the rosharan system have anti-investitures of their own. khriss states that, though long theorized, the anti-lights are her first evidence of an anti-investiture. notes[edit]"
Jez's Duty,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Jez%27s_Duty,"jez's duty is a winehouse in urithiru on roshar. it is likely named after the herald jezrien and is located in the ten rings section of the breakaway marketplace. history[edit] adolin kholin began to frequent jez's duty around eight months before the evacuation of hearthstone. he made kaladin go with him from time to time, including the day when jor and kryst held their wedding party there. after the coalition's army left for the offensive in emul, the activity level noticeably dropped in the winehouse. kaladin and teft chose it as the place to meet rlain when they were searching for dabbid. during that meeting, raboniel managed to turn the tower's defense mechanisms back on the knights radiant, causing teft to fall unconscious. after the occupation of the tower was overthrown, jez's duty was the location of a party in honor of teft after his funeral. aside from the party, kaladin arranged a meeting with noril, dabbid, and the other members of his talk therapy group that day at the winehouse, in order to decompress from the stressful events of urithiru's occupation. establishment culture[edit] the interior of jez's duty is decorated as a stormshelter, with fabrial clocks on the wall showing when a highstorm is happening in alethkar. the winehouse holds a daily vigil for alethkar and occasionally hosts an ardent, who comes to burn glyphwards. it is typically patronized by darkeyes and, especially, soldiers. adolin kholin frequents jez's duty and has a reserved booth at the back; this is a point of pride for the establishment, especially since the atmosphere tends to be more raucous and closer to that of a tavern than that of a typical winehouse. when shallan visits, she tends to carve the table with different bits of art. employees[edit] notes[edit]"
Yunfah,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Yunfah,"yunfah is an honorspren on roshar. he was bonded to windrunner vratim before their death. appearance and personality[edit] in the physical realm, yunfah can change his shape and size like any other honorspren. to kaladin, he appears as tiny old man with a long beard flying on a small cloud. yunfah doesn't seem to be affected much by the death of his bonded radiant. like other honorspren, yunfah too likes hierarchy and considers kaladin his superior. he detests the idea of bonding with a singer, even one fighting against odium. according to syl, yunfah loves the physical realm and doesn't want to return to shadesmar. attributes and abilities[edit] being an honorspren, yunfah can form a nahel bond with a willing human. this bond gives the bonded human access to the surges of the order of windrunners, namely adhesion and gravitation. history[edit] during the true desolation, yunfah was among the honorspren who left shadesmar, against the will of senior honorspren, to bond humans. he later bonded vratim, making them a windrunner. vratim later died during a battle. a few months later kaladin ordered yunfah to try bonding with rlain within ten days, to which yunfah reluctantly agreed. later, rlain rejected the bond viewing it as 'forced'. notes[edit]"
Eth,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Eth,"eth is a member of bridge four on roshar. mart is his brother. appearance and personality[edit] eth seems to have a good-humored personality and enjoys needling his friends, including skar and rock. like many people, he is relatively ignorant regarding listener culture. attributes and abilities[edit] eth and a number of the other bridgemen receive basic field medic training from kaladin. he also has combat training and is presumably considered to be a competent fighter, since he is assigned to guard the king on several occasions. eth becomes a windrunner squire to kaladin, giving him some limited abilities with stormlight when he is near kaladin. he was one of several bridgemen that carried jezrien's honorblade, although it is unclear if he actually used it. history[edit] eth and mart were caught planning to desert, and they were sent to the bridge crews as punishment. after dalinar freed bridge four, eth often served as a personal guard for the kholins alongside his brother and other bridge four members. he guarded the door during a meeting that dalinar and elhokar held at the pinnacle, preventing anyone but highprinces from entering without permission. during szeth's attack on dalinar, mart and eth were assigned to guard the king. after the attack, eth treated adolin's and dalinar's wounds before kaladin returned to them. eth also served as a guard for adolin. he was present during one of kaladin's shardblade training sessions and guarded the room where adolin prepared for his duel against four shardbearers. eth survived szeth's attack on dalinar during the battle of narak, but his brother mart did not; eth mourned over his body. he was present during shallan's investigation of re-shephir and did not seem to fear the unmade. eth became a radiant squire to kaladin and in one training session stuck a rock to his hand with an errant lashing, amusing his friends. during another practice exercise of bridge four, eth used the term ""shellheads"" in reference to the voidbringers before hastily telling rlain that he didn't mean any offense. he asked rlain if he knew why the fused were attacking trade caravans on the shattered plains. eth called the fused rlain's ""kinsmen,"" to which rlain responded by saying that the fused were his enemy and he and his people had spent their entire lives hiding from their old gods. before the battle of thaylen field, taravangian sent a member of the diagram to bridge four's barracks to steal jezrien's honorblade, which eth was holding at the time. the assassin used teft's bridge four uniform coat as a disguise to get into the area. during the attack, rock and bisig were badly injured and eth was killed. teft felt responsible for eth's death. notes[edit]"
Yake,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Yake,"yake is a member of bridge four on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] yake is described as stout with thick arms, and is presumably darkeyed. yake is reliable, and is quick to follow orders. he does not seem superstitious, as he dismisses maps's death rattle as ""just dying delirium"". he initially seems introverted, but later opens up and often teases his fellow bridgemen. powers and abilities[edit] yake is trained in the use of the spear, and received some special training regarding shardblades. he became a radiant windrunner squire to kaladin, gaining the ability to breathe in stormlight and heal wounds, along with limited surgebinding abilities when kaladin was nearby. yake presumably swears at least the second ideal of the windrunners at some point; by 1175 all of the original bridge four members have reached that level or higher, except rlain and dabbid. history[edit] yake was already in the sadeas bridge crews when kaladin arrived to the shattered plains in 1173. the reason he was a bridgeman is unknown. he participated in the first bridge run actively led by kaladin, and was among the last to arrive for duty, along with dunny and malop. after gaz put bridge four on chasm duty, yake took notice of the growing camaraderie among the group but was reluctant to join their conversations. weeks later, he was hit in the arm by an enemy arrow during a bridge run, leaving bridge four with only twenty-eight capable members. when kaladin was training bridge four how to fight with the spear, yake and hobber struggled with their thrusts; kaladin asked moash to work with them. yake, moash, and teft were selected by kaladin to train with zahel and ivis, learning how to deal with shardblades and use stances. zahel chided yake for picking up one of his colored stones. yake briefly wielded a blade, and was awestruck by it. he also practiced dodging blows from a blade. he found ivis attractive even though she was lighteyed, unlike kaladin. after becoming one of kaladin's squires, he greeted rlain during a training session and suggested that he should educate the new recruits in how to hold a spear. he and eth asked rlain about the fused attacking caravans, making the common error of lumping the listeners in with other singers. trivia[edit] - yake is a cameo for an unknown friend or family member of brandon's. notes[edit]"
Sel,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Late_Era,"""“sel-home to multiple empires that, uniquely, have remained somewhat ignorant of one another. it is a willful kind of ignorance, with each of the three great domains pretending that the others are mere blips on the map, barely worth notice. ”-khriss"" sel, also known as seol, is a planet in selish system of the cosmere, and is the setting of the books elantris and the emperor's soul, as well as the short story the hope of elantris. sel is inhabited by humans and artificially created beings called seons and skaze. it is a relatively large planet, being 1.5 times the size of the cosmere standard, and contains diverse landscapes home to multiple great civilizations including at least three empires. people from sel are called selish. astronomy[edit] sel is the second planet in the selish system, orbiting a yellow star named mashe while in turn being orbited by a single blue-white moon named oem. its size is 1.5 cosmere standard and its gravity is 1.2 cosmere standard. this makes the radius come to 5944.6 miles (9566.90634 km), the surface area to 444073787 miles squared (1150145828.44 km2), and the circumference to around 37351 miles (60110.608 km), and a gravitational acceleration of 11.76798 m/s2.[fn 1] geography and culture[edit] opelon/sycla[edit] the story of elantris and the short story the hope of elantris are both set on a continent on sel called opelon by those in the west and sycla by those in the east. there is a vast desert to the south of the known nations of the continent. fjordell empire[edit] most nations on sycla have been subsumed into the fjordell empire. the empire is ruled by a leader known as wyrn, who is also head of shu-dereth, which has been used as a vehicle to dominate nations. the fjordell empire is, on the surface, completely derethi. however, many of the people of the empire, especially those in backcountry areas like hrovell, still secretly follow their old religions, like the jeskeri mysteries. the fjordell empire is made up of the following nations: arelon[edit] located to the west of the fjordell empire, arelon is the only remaining independent nation on opelon. the capital of arelon is the city of elantris, which is a monarchy ruled by the elantrian king raoden. under the king, there is a class of nobles who control various plantations throughout arelon. their primary function is to distribute food to the people of arelon. arelon controls the area to the west of the atad mountains, and south of the northern ocean. arelon is mainly made up of followers of the shu-korath religion, although there are still remnants of the old pagan religion that worshiped the elantrians. there is also a small number of followers of the jeskeri mysteries. the northern continent[edit] there is another continent north of opelon. no official name for this continent has been revealed. teod[edit] the nation of teod is located on a small peninsula attached to the northern continent. the capital of teod is teoras, and its ruler is king eventeo. teod's martial strength exists mainly in the form of its navy, which dominates the northern sea, protecting teod's borders from the fjordell empire. unlike the rest of the northern continent, teod is within opelon's cultural sphere of influence. for example, the nation's state religion is shu-korath, which originated in opelon. the teo people are also of aonic descent and are therefore related to the arelene and dula people of opelon. rose empire[edit] north of the teod peninsula, beyond the mountains, is the rose empire. this empire has many provinces, including but not limited to mulla'dil, maipon, dzhamar and ukurgi. the empire maintains a little-used mountain pass that leads to teod. unlike teod, the rose empire has limited cultural exchange with the nations of opelon, though it has some diplomatic relations with svorden and jindo. by the time of the assassination attempt on emperor ashravan, they seem to have made contact with the fjordell empire, as a southern ambassador with red priest's armor is present while shai is rushing through the palace. certain segments of the population seem to have a concept of realmatic theory. the story of the emperor's soul is set in the rose empire. aonic calendar[edit] the aonic calendar is used by the people of arelon and teod. it has at least six months, with eostek being the sixth, and at least six days in a week, with maedal being the second and opedal being the sixth. history[edit] early history and mythology[edit] ""“both devotion and dominion were destroyed. their investiture - their power - was splintered, their minds ripped away, their souls sent into the beyond.”-khriss on the history of sel"" at an unknown date the planet was settled by devotion and dominion against the rules made by the original vessels. odium used this as justification to attack both of the shards, this battle resulted in their splintering. their investiture was then moved from the spiritual realm into the cognitive to prevent anyone else from taking the shards. this latent investiture became dangerous plasma and was named the dor and some of these splinters became the seons and skaze. they were created from the investiture of devotion and dominion respectively. because of this, the world's magic systems became region specific. these consequences were a side effect of odium's actions, he didn't intend them to happen. three major empires eventually formed on sel. due to the planet's size, these empires largely ignored each other and considered the others as irrelevant. one of the reasons for this isolation is the difficulty of travelling between the empires. two such empires are the rose empire and fjordell. shu-keseg rose as a religion focused on the unity of all people. a schism later formed in the religion over a disagreement on what unity meant, this lead to the creation of the shu-korath and shu-dereth traditions. the original fjordell empire was formed and the first wyrn was created. the empire eventually collapsed three hundred years before the events of elantris. around this time a schism formed in the shu-keseg faith forming shu-korath and shu-dereth. the remnants of the fjorden empire blamed their collapse on a lack of true unity, as a result they adopted the newly formed shu-dereth as the state religion, it was hoped that by doing so they would prevent any future rebellions or political problems. they mixed the shu-dereth faith with fjorden mythology and made jaddeth the central deity of their religion. a movement was begun to update their religious and historical texts in order to make it seem that fjorden was always of this faith and that the first wyrn also worshipped jaddeth. the new fjorden empire[edit] the monasteries of fjorden were formed and began training their members. these monasteries and internal fjorden politics began to be influenced by the skaze, in particular their want for power. overtime this new empire expanded so as to include most of the continent, with only duladel, teod and arelon resisting them. by this time the new empire had become stronger than the original ever was, though their strength was in the power of their priests rather than military might. wulfden the fourth became the new wyrn and leader of the shu-dereth church. feeling threatened by this new wyrn the leaders of shu-korath named seinalan as their new high priest because of his relative youth. an earthquake happened near the city of elantris, this earthquake then triggered an event known as the reod causing elantris to fall. the earthquake was not due to natural causes. the native elantrians became hoeds and the arelene government collapsed. the majority of damage and death during the resulting riots was caused by the countries servant class. after the riots eased the government was replaced with a system where the wealthiest ruled the country. the newly empowered merchant class blamed the riots on the servants of the city being too pampered. king iadon was crowned in response. deciding that the new system of wealth based politics was unstable he secretly wrote a new law that was to take effect either fifteen years after it was written or after his death, whichever came first, he then entrusted this with seinalan. the law removed the wealth based system of arelon government and made its positions be determined by lineage like other nations, he based this model of teod's. to foster peace with the fjorden empire he also allowed for shu-dereth priests to preach to their people. nevertheless the empire remained dissatisfied and a push was made by fjorden to convert the leaders of arelene from shu-keseg to shu dereth and have them pledge loyalty. the nation of teod also spoke less with arelon after the events of the reod. gyorn hrathen was assigned to convert duladel to the empire, as it was one of the few remaining nations offering resistance. within six months he managed to lead a revolution that led to the deaths of the republican class and collapse of its government. in its place a monarchy was formed and shu-dereth pronounced the state religion at the expense of to the jesker religion. this event caused a renewed interest in an alliance between teod and arelon, a marriage was planned between prince raoden and princess sarene. having successfully converted duladel, hrathen was then dispatched to arelon. unbeknownst to him dilaf, his old mentor, was already dispatched to the area and preparing to invade it. upon meeting hrathen failed to recognize him and also misunderstood his orders as to convert the people of arelon, not destroy them. before the marriage of sarene and raoden could take place raoden found himself taken by the shaod. an effort was made by sarene to oppose hrathen's preaching and his attempts to instate telrii as the new king of arelon. telrii had agreed that if he became king he would make arelon convert to shu-dereth. after sarene discovered the king iadon was part of the religious cult known as the jeskeri mysteries where he sacrificed women the king was dethroned. after this event king iadon killed himself. to try and prevent the nation of arelon from falling into derethi control it was decided that sarene had to marry roial in order to legitimize his claim to the throne. before the marriage the funeral of king iadon took place and as per his will a new law was pronounced by seinalan that reformed the arelene government again. hrathen managed to make it appear sarene was taken by the shaod before her marriage stopping it. this led to telrii being crowned king of arelon. after this telrii refused to follow through on the deal he made with hrathen unless he was also made a gyorn as a gyorn held greater power in the fjorden empire. he insisted on this despite hrathen's protests that such a thing was impossible. seeing this failure dilaf then announced his true rank as gragdet and the true nature of hrathen mission. he then began the invasion of arelon. during the invasion raoden worked out how to undo the reod and restore elantris. with their renewed power the fjoredell army was removed and raoden and sarene were both crowned the new monarchs of arelon. the skaze for a brief time worked alongside hoid. hoid promised them that he could become an elantrian, when his efforts failed the skaze mocked him for it. the rose empire[edit] the shu-dereth religion never historically threatened the rose empire because they view its land as unholy. the rose empire was ruled by eighty factions, one faction for each sun that they believed existed. these factions then elect an emperor to sit on the rose throne. emperor yazad died and under pressure from his faction ashravan put himself forward for the position. this was accepted and he became the new emperor. initially he hoped to lead a series of reformations to help the empire his desire waned however and he became distracted with the bureaucracy of the empire. the glory faction of the empire moved in and assassinated emperor ashraven. his wounds were fixed by a resealer, however he was left brain damaged. because his wife died as well his faction, the heritage faction claimed that he was well and in his customary one hundred days of mourning. in desperation they turned to a forger known as shai in order to recreate the emperor's soul. she succeeded in these efforts and also escaped the country on the 98th day of her imprisonment. ashraven had their soul recreated and they quickly worked out what had happened, his soul was made so that he would remember his old ideals and bring about the reforms he had wanted to as a youth. invested arts[edit] each invested art on sel use symbols, shapes, or forms as ""code"" to direct magical effects. they are all powered by the dor, making them end-positive. because their power is coming from the cognitive realm, the selish invested arts are highly location dependent. the strength of each invested art decreases the farther one travels from its associated region, symbols in an invested art often come from the geography or culture of their region, and initiation is often restricted to people from the associated region. - uses symbols called - , which can be drawn directly in

object or person. supposedly the forgery helps the object (or soul) remember a different past, or a likely destiny in order to change the actual essence of the object. the symbols on the front side indicate what a soulstamp does; the ""setting mark"" on the back side indicates that the stamp is complete and looks like - . - , like forgery, uses stamps, but they must be inked with fresh blood. bloodsealers can mark a door, which will set their - to attack the person from whom the blood came if they pass through the door. people on sel can also form bonds, similar to the nahel bond on roshar, with seons and skaze. unlike the participants in the nahel bond, people bonded to seons are not shown to gain direct supernatural powers themselves, instead requesting that their companions use their abilities. what advantage a skaze bond grants is not clear at this time. cosmere[edit] sel is the most realmatically knowledgeable of the known planets in the cosmere. it is home to two shards, devotion and dominion, and their powers have influenced many selish traditions, religions, and languages. at some point in sel's distant past, odium killed the vessels of both devotion and dominion and splintered the two shards. the collective power of the splintered shards became somehow trapped in the cognitive realm, and is now what selish people call the dor. because of this, while travel to sel is possible via the cognitive realm (for example, one can use a perpendicularity that exists in the form of a pool of sapphire-colored liquid near elantris), the raging uncontrolled power of the dor makes travel through the selish cognitive realm incredibly dangerous. hoid has visited both arelon and the capital of the rose empire. trivia[edit] - initially, brandon had the shadows of elantris falling on the city of kae at dawn. as kae is to the east of elantris, this indicated that the sun rises in the west on sel. however, in the anniversary edition, this was identified as an error and corrected. notes[edit]"
Dzhamar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Dzhamarian,"dzhamar is a swampy region of the rose empire on sel. it borders the mountains of mulla'dil. dzhamarians are very pale with milky-white (nearly translucent) skin, white hair, and red eyes. their movements are somehow unnatural, and their appearance tends to give them an ageless quality to outsiders. dzhamar is the homeland of bloodsealing. their magic is generally regarded as sinister by other nations, but the grands are not above hiring them. dzhamar was presumably once an independent nation, and it maintains a unique cultural identity as a constituent country of the empire. there is an intense hatred between the dzhamarians and their neighbors, the strikers. notable residents[edit] notes[edit]"

Dakhor,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Dahkor,"the dakhor is a manifestation of investiture on sel, independent from aondor. its official name is unknown, but the users of this system are the monks of dakhor monastery in fjorden, including dilaf. the dakhor monks themselves are a newer development than elantrians. in fact, wulfden the fourth was preparing to use them against elantris before the city fell on its own. its exact mechanics are so far unclear, but will be explored more fully in the elantris sequel. prerequisites[edit] in order to access the dor through the dakhor magic system, a few things have to occur. it appears that the practitioners of dakhor have to be fjordell. chanting is also used and the chants are likely used to determine how the person is changed, and what type of bone growths form. bone growth[edit] the bones of the person accessing dakhor begin to grow and twist. since the investiture of sel is form-based, the shape of the bone twists determines what powers a user of dakhor can access. the shapes that they twist into are ancient fjordell characters. dakhor users look like twisted figures with arms like knotted tree branches and tight skin pulled over strange ridges. their bones appear as if a piece of metal had been inserted beneath the skin and their skeletons appears twisted and carved. while they are abnormal, the dakhor monks don't seem deformed or inhuman. their bone growth is subtle enough that a robe can hide it. even with the initially repulsive nature of the bone twists, they still have a beautiful shape. the bone twists are also known to glow, specifically when teleportation or enhanced strength is being used. sacrifices[edit] in order to access certain powers of dakhor, living sacrifices must be made. a ritual needs to be performed before the sacrifices can be killed, and dakhor users cannot just slaughter people immediately. the amount of investiture in the people killed is far more important than the number of people killed. sacrifices will have their souls twisted, not stolen. effects and abilities[edit] regardless of how the dakhor system is accessed, there are some constant effects. dakhor can grant several abilities, some of which are part of the standard ability set for monks of dakhor monastery. the first is the extreme strength of anyone who uses dakhor. the bones of the the dakhor monks are almost indestructible, leaving melee weapons mostly useless against them. those who use dakhor can receive enhanced speed as well. another more costly power is teleportation. in exchange for one person's death, large groups of people can be transported instantaneously. the body and spirit of the sacrificed are used to power this ability. another ability granted by dakhor can change a person's appearance, such as race. this could presumably be used to change any aspect of a person's appearance. dakhor can also grant the ability to negate aons drawn by elantrians, though it is also possible for dakhor to be negated by aondor. another dakhor ability is resistance to attacks from the dor. this power requires the deaths of fifty people and thus is rarely given. it is unknown if the ability to negate aons and the resistance to dor attacks are two separate abilities or both tied to the same type of bone shape. dakhor users live longer than regular humans. if a bloodsealer were to use bloodsealing on the bones of someone who used dakhor, the bones would still be able to access the dor. it would take more than just the bones of a dakhor monk for a kandra to get dakhor abilities. relationship to fjorden[edit] dakhor has a specific tie to the land of fjorden. like all selish magic, dakhor will decrease in power the further from fjorden a user gets. it is better than aondor and forgery at bringing the power with the user. dakhor is also known as the order of bone. known dakhor[edit] - , although only one arm. notes[edit]"
Teleb,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Teleb,"""“teleb, you storming miracle. ”-dalinar, after teleb shoots the soldiers posing a threat"" teleb is a lighteyed officer and shardbearer in dalinar's warcamp on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] teleb is tall, straight-backed, and has light green eyes. well-muscled in his arms and shoulders, he has long hair that he wears in a braid and a blue tattoo on his cheek that marks him as an oldblood. he is married to kalami. he is as literal as rocks and also tends to keep his opinions to himself. teleb has what dalinar considers to be the marks of a great officer--not only obeying orders with which one disagrees, but also offering innovative suggestions. he also likes to show off by making sure the army is displayed in perfect arrangement when awaiting dalinar's arrival. attributes and abilities[edit] teleb is a highly skilled archer, able to consistently hit targets from around four hundred yards. he is also proficient in wearing shardplate and wielding a shardblade. in addition, teleb holds a position of command in the kholin army and seems to be a reliable, competent leader. history[edit] ""teleb: ""obey or die? "" dalinar: ""the same deal i offered you, teleb. you were smart enough to take it. "" ―teleb questioning dalinar at the rift"" dalinar recruited teleb into his elites when he attacked teleb's home in 1140. assigned by his brightlord yezriar to assassinate the highprince, teleb shot dalinar with an arrow from nearly four hundred yards away. dalinar was impressed by this feat and promptly gave him the choice of joining his army, to which teleb reluctantly agreed in exchange for sparing his town from pillaging. during the first assault at rathalas, teleb proved his worth by shooting the soldiers that were trying to drop dalinar in the rift by cutting the bridge from under him. at a dinner when gavilar was trying to convince toh that the alethi were strong enough to protect him and his sister, dalinar made the point for him by walking over to another bunker in the midst of a highstorm to ask teleb if he still had dalinar's favorite knife. dalinar grew to regard teleb highly enough that he was given use of adolin's plate, the shards that toh and evi had brought with them as a bargaining chip, until adolin was old enough to use the plate himself. a few years later, the next time the army was attacking the rift, teleb was in charge of directing the army and assigned a group of scouts to tail a large caravan that had just left rathalas. when dalinar went to investigate tanalan's report that the caravan included an alethi highprince, he left teleb in charge of the army in his absence. teleb sent another team of scouts after dalinar as soon as tanalan turned on the alethi forces, and the team reported that dalinar's group had been ambushed and killed. assuming dalinar was dead, he then began planning for a siege to allow gavilar time to arrive and seek vengeance on his brother's death. upon dalinar's arrival back at the camp, teleb obeyed orders to have the scouts imprisoned and to set the army's soulcaster to making oil. teleb tried to talk dalinar out of burning the city, but not very strongly, and he was disregarded. in the warcamps during the war of reckoning, he was dalinar's highofficer on duty when a chasmfiend was detected crawling up on a plateau only two hours away. when dalinar decided to march, he had teleb send for adolin. teleb discussed using man-carried bridges with dalinar, who was opposed to the idea. knowing dalinar's opinion, he suggested using them to reach a contested plateau faster but not for the assault itself. though dalinar was hesitant, he knew the value of listening to a highly-regarded officer's advice, and he told teleb he could train one bridge crew for the purpose of testing the idea. because chull-drawn bridges would be needed for the assault, teleb tried to design a new kind of bridge; his first attempt failed because the bridge didn't stand the weight of the chulls. as dalinar returned from the battle of the tower, he sent a message to teleb that he should bring the entire camp to alert and mobilize the remaining soldiers, preparing for anything. at a later point, adolin gave teleb use of the plate he won from his duel with eranniv, which he subsequently painted silver and wielded along with a shardhammer. ""“brightlord teleb has fallen! highprince roion has been routed. his lines are broken, his remaining men surrounded by parshendi!”-news of teleb's death reaching dalinar"" teleb served in his position as highlord on the expedition to find urithiru. he alerted dalinar to rlain's approach, though rlain refused to speak to him and only answered dalinar's questions. teleb was given command of sebarial's army during the battle of narak, but he died in the conflict while supporting roion's troops. the king's blade he was wielding was recovered by captain khal, although his plate was lost. during the battle of thaylen field, odium brought up dalinar's memory of killing yezriar as part of his attempt to make dalinar give in to him. seemingly this was because dalinar's high regard for teleb caused him to realize yezriar must have been a very good man to hold teleb's loyalty. trivia[edit] - teleb's character has several similarities to - , one of the great generals of the mongol army during the 1200s. these include that jebe, as an enemy of genghis khan, shot him in the neck. after being brought to genghis, he promised to serve him loyally. notes[edit]"
Fen Rnamdi,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Fen_Rnamdi,"her royal highness, brightness fen rnamdi is the queen of thaylenah, an island kingdom on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] fen has an oval face, yellow eyes, and white thaylen eyebrows she kept curled to hang down beside her cheeks. she let her grey hair fall down to cover her shoulders. when speaking with confidence, queen fen can be very direct to the point of rudeness, however, when moving to “queenspeak” it means she lost trust in the conversation. she wants the conversation be genuine and honest. - images of queen fen attributes and abilities[edit] fen is a skilled politician who understands strategy and interaction with other kingdoms. during a visit to a vision with dalinar, her leadership skills were on display, as she was able to organize the town and confront the enemy. history[edit] after the everstorm[edit] the everstorm hit thaylenah several times causing much damage. the storm broke their aqueducts and sewer systems and ripped apart the docks. they would have to rebuild the city. the parshmen transformed, stole a grand fleet of royal warships and private trading vessels and used them to flee the city. at that time, she was contacted by dalinar. she was not open to going to urithiru and was even more suspicious of the oathgates and the radiants. she did not want to be responsible for thaylenah to fall to the alethi. dalinar’s visions[edit] the first vision dalinar asked for fen to receive was the radiants falling from the sky to fight the midnight essence. he was placed far away and was unable to get to her until the battle had passed. she was able to save the child, though she left the mother to die, and organized the town, pitting them against the enemy. dalinar joined her, asking her to join his coalition again. when she refused, his temper showed and he shouted. that was when fen actually started listening again. she explained she wanted honesty and truth. she ended the vision being asked by the radiant to join them at urithiru. this seemed to trouble her. she would consider his sincerity, though dalinar could sense she was concerned he had turned sides. she was shown different visions, until, in a morning’s highstorm, the queen of thaylenah had asked that dalinar send her into the vision of aharietiam, which she knew about from the published accounts of dalinar’s visions. he’d reluctantly sent her alone, without supervision. shortly after that, she agreed to receive dalinar at thaylen city. roshar’s coalition[edit] upon dalinar’s arrival at thaylen city, fen gave them the tour of the ten temples. navani believed it comforted her by doing something familiar. she did not intend to linger on the two oldest temples and when dalinar went to see them, he found out they had used them to keep the wounded people. she left them some food and went to see to other matters, a political strategy to show she was the one with power there. dalinar then duels her son, purposefully losing to show his radiant powers of healing himself. upon review, dalinar regrets this and calls for renarin to aid in the healing of fen's people with progression while dalinar used his surgebinding to repair temples and other structures. after both those events, fen accepted the invitation to join the coalition, and called it the first real united vorin coalition the world had seen since the hierocracy. she later aided dalinar on getting the azish to join as well, not only by providing useful tactics, but with a letter to them, asking them to do so. at the meeting, she and her consort committed to the coalition. she asked for free trade and was curious of the fabrials that could lead to shardplate, but settled to agreements after navani gave her kingdom the task to oversee trade and supplies fairly. by the next meeting, where dalinar understood that the target would be thaylen city, fen understood and helped plot the defense; they agreed to have the next meeting at thaylenah. that meeting started very positive, however, after taravangian's treason and the leakage of dalinar’s secrets, the coalition broke. queen fen was mostly worried that before elhokar went to alethkar, he swore to dalinar to accept him as highking. her trust in him was compromised by this. bitter as she was, she acknowledged war was still coming and she could not afford to let him go. battle of thaylen city[edit] just before the battle, queen fen, her consort, and navani were looking at the battlefield from a tower. the odds didn’t look that bad until amaram’s army turned sides. during the battle itself, they were attacked by a thunderclast that absently destroyed the tower they were in. navani and fen were able to go down the surviving steps. navani, fen, and her consort kmakl were then captured by one of amaram’s troops who still blamed the kholins for the killing of torol sadeas. as they were going to execute kmakl, navani pulled out her painrial and knocked their enemies down. after that, they were joined by adolin and later jasnah came in to ask them to clear the center of the city and save citizens. once the battle ended, dalinar accepted a respectful bow from the queen. relationships[edit] kmakl[edit] her closest personal relation seems to be kmakl, her consort. he accompanies her everywhere and usually he would only stand behind her and-whenever she said something he thought significant-nod for her scribes to record it in the official histories. he would sometimes give his opinion, like his reading on the battlefield at thaylenah. quotes[edit] ""“he acts as if this city is a burial ground. that is not the case. we will rebuild from stone. ”-queen fen to dalinar on taravangian’s compassion for the destruction of the everstorm"" trivia[edit] - thaylenah is kind of a plutocracy, with merchant councils holding a lot of power, which changes its dynamic a little when compared to alethi or jah keved. notes[edit]"
Skar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Skar,"skar is a member of bridge four and is company second for the order of windrunners on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] skar is short and wiry. he has sharp features, and his hair is turning silver at the temples, although he is only in his early thirties. he is never without his spear. he tends to be stubborn and extremely loyal. he has a lot of faith in kaladin and his abilities as a knight radiant, as well as a strong feeling of identity as a member of bridge four. skar was one of two bridgemen that instinctively understood the training kaladin gave them, the other being moash. he is described by kaladin as a killer. skar tries not to feel sorry for himself. he helps encourage others, such as lyn, on their journey to become windrunner squires. this shows that skar tends to put others before himself. attributes and abilities[edit] skar is a windrunner of at least the second ideal. history[edit] before bridge four[edit] before finding himself on bridge four, skar was a laborer, more specifically a rocksplitter. wanting more for himself, he aspired to join the ranks of the blackcaps, highprince aladar's personal bodyguards. when skar approached the blackcaps to join them, they told him that while they did accept darkeyes, they did not accept runts. after some consideration, the blackcaps told skar that if he could outfit himself with a uniform, armor and weapons they would consider letting skar join. as a common darkeyed laborer, skar had no money or resources to get the equipment he needed. thinking that the blackcaps would see him as resourceful and daring, he stole the necessary gear from the blackcaps' quartermaster. instead of being impressed with skar, they branded him a slave and sold him to torol sadeas. once purchased by sadeas's army, skar was quickly put into the bridge crews and he found himself on bridge four. bridge four[edit] he was one of the first to join in and eat rock's stew. he became one of the bridge's subsquad commanders. skar stood watch over kaladin during his recovery from being hung up in a highstorm. skar sustained an injury to his leg during the battle of the tower. after being promoted to lieutenant by kaladin, he and moash (the best fighters among the bridge crews) were assigned to guard dalinar kholin. when bridge four received their guard uniforms, skar was the first to tear off the cobalt guard patch, insisting that they were bridge four instead. at the battle of narak, he and drehy were assigned to guard adolin. he helped save adolin from plummeting into a chasm by grabbing and holding onto the steel link skirt of his shardplate. two weeks after the battle of narak, of bridge four only skar, rlain, and dabbid were unable to draw in stormlight. skar tried to not feel sorry for himself, but he worried that he would no longer be useful in bridge four. skar also didn't want the other members of bridge four to pity him or to console him; he wanted things to remain as they were and for them to see him as a good solider. during a bridge four training exercise, skar helped sigzil and other members of bridge four measure and test out the abilities of someone infused with stormlight. for one test he ran a mile through the markets of urithiru to the ramp of the oathgate, comparing his time to drehy, who did the same run while powered by stormlight. while waiting for kaladin to show up and activate the oathgate, skar and teft had a conversation regarding skar's place in bridge four. skar vented his frustrations to teft about not gaining his powers, and teft noted that there was nothing wrong with being on the support team. skar vehemently disagreed with the notion, telling teft how long he had waited to hold a spear and get a chance to prove himself as a warrior. while thinking on his future role in bridge four, skar engaged in conversation with the scout lyn, who was chosen as a possible candidate to join the windrunners. lyn shared skar's frustration about not being able to absorb stormlight. instead of telling lyn to not feel sorry for herself, he told her the story of when kaladin first absorbed stormlight. it was the bridge run in which bridge four was a target for parshendi arrows, and it was getting particularly bloody. skar was in the second row, and the man in front of him stood beside kaladin. the man in front of skar fell, and skar knew for certainty that he would fall next, as he was then fully exposed. just as he came to peace with dying, the arrows that were shot at him swerved and hit next to kaladin instead; kaladin had drawn the arrows towards himself unconsciously, thus saving skar's life. skar asked lyn why she wanted to be a windrunner, and she responded by saying that she wanted to soar. skar told her that that wasn't good enough, that kaladin wasn't thinking about flying or being left out when he first gained his powers: he was thinking about saving the bridge four, about saving skar. he told lyn that she needed to make the most of the opportunity, to seize hold of it and try her best. skar told her that if she didn't and gave up instead, then she had no right to complain. as lyn was contemplating skar's words, she sucked in stormlight. after she did this skar mused if that was his lot - being a teacher or facilitator to people wanting to become radiants. walking over to rock, skar asked him if he could help cook, since he probably would never become a windrunner. while discussing this rock noted that skar was glowing. skar had finally drawn in and absorbed stormlight, becoming a full squire to the windrunners. kholinar mission[edit] skar was chosen by kaladin to be a part of the mission to travel to kholinar and assess its current status. on the trip there he displayed some basic understanding of lashes, as he and drehy helped kaladin keep everyone on the mission in the air. during the battle of kholinar, skar played a big part in the battle, as one of the better warriors in the humans' group. he moved back and forth between fighting with kaladin to helping protect shallan as she attempted to fight the unmade that had infiltrated kholinar. skar was not among those on the oathgate to be transferred to the shadesmar. it is assumed he and drehy remained in kholinar trying to find a way to escape. after the battle of thaylen field, kaladin traveled to a cave on a coast in alethkar on information received via spanreed. upon entering the cave, he found that skar and drehy had survived the battle of kholinar, having covered their tattoos and scars with ash. not only had they survived, they had also managed to protect elhokar's son and the heir to the alethi throne, gavinor, as well as vathah and the rest of shallan's followers and a small group of other refugees. after kholinar[edit] skar married ristina, a scribe, and bridge four was present at the wedding. he was a part of the expedition to hearthstone on the fourth bridge and fought the heavenly ones there along with other windrunners. skar volunteered to accompany rock and his family on their return to the horneater peaks, and left about four weeks before kaladin began working as a surgeon. he was promoted to the role of company second once kaladin stepped down - this job's responsibilities included overseeing and leading the windrunners on missions. once they returned to the shattered plains, skar and drehy gave kaladin the news that rock wouldn't be coming back. skar returned to urithiru after the singer occupation ended and was present at teft's funeral, along with all remaining members of bridge four. trivia[edit] - skar is a cameo of a good friend of brandon named - , who has a military background. - he is planned to play a major role in the lunamor novella notes[edit]"
William Ann Montane,https://coppermind.net/wiki/William_Ann,"william ann montane is the fourteen year-old daughter of silence montane, who lives with and helps her mother in the running of a waystop in the forests of hell. appearance & personality[edit] william ann takes after her father in appearance, and is already taller than her mother by fourteen. she often complains of awkwardness or being too tall, but silence thinks that these attributes imply that william ann will be beautiful. history[edit] on the night silence spotted chesterton divide in her waystop, william ann prepared a half dose of fenweed for the men, and convinced her mother to let her come along to track them down. she helped her mother to kill chesterton and his men for their bounty, and to recover the body from red young, who later cut them off at the old bridge and took her hostage. she was pushed through a shade by red after he drew her blood. silence rushed her to the waystop and saved william ann's life--stopping her from being turned into a shade--by pouring a mixture of powdered silver and water down her throat and on her face. however, her left side was blackened in the process, leaving her hand and some of her toes in need of amputation. notes[edit]"
Scouring of Aimia,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Scouring_of_Aimia,"""“they assumed their secrets would protect them, but then their allies fell. and secrets can't hold swords. ”-nikli about the scouring"" the scouring of aimia was a destructive event that took place on the rosharan island nation of aimia. history[edit] aimia was one of the silver kingdoms during the heraldic epochs, and it contained an oathgate on the island of akinah. the islands were made habitable by fabrials that caused lush plants to grow, turning it into a paradise. the kingdom was considered strange by the other silver kingdoms, though it maintained a close relationship with the knights radiant. not long after the recreance and the fall of the radiants, the other kingdoms turned on aimia. they saw the fabrials and lanceryn that the kingdom had and wanted that wealth for themselves. the invaders destroyed the fabrials keeping the island's ecosystem alive, and the naturally inhospitable storms and cold weather returned. having relied on the radiants for protection, the aimians lacked military defenses, and many people were killed in the fighting. the human survivors fled to an area near alm, while the siah aimians abandoned aimia to roam in other parts of roshar. most of the sleepless, believing the lanceryn extinct, took up the responsibility for guarding the islands, particularly the akinah dawnshard mural. they believed that revealing the secrets held on the island could lead to the destruction of worlds. in her work mythica, hessi posited that dai-gonarthis may have been responsible for the scouring. aftermath[edit] the invading forces looted whatever they could find on the islands and then abandoned it. without the fabrial protection, the vast majority of aimia's ecosystem collapsed, leading to the presumed extinction of the lanceryn and the near-extinction of the larkin. anything else that originated in aimia (including soulcaster fabrials) became quite rare after the scouring. the lands became desolate and battered by storms; this led to aimia's isolation from the rest of roshar since it could not be reached by ship. additionally, the oathgate on akinah is not functioning and is thought to have been destroyed. rumors, folk tales, and superstitions about the islands and their former residents swirl throughout the rest of roshar. occasional sightings of aimians such as axies the collector and arclomedarian serve to perpetuate these rumors. descendants of the humans who lived in aimia still live in alm and are known to wear their beards in a similar fashion to people in nearby steen. some sailors continue to attempt to reach aimia, spurred on by rumors of treasure (including gemhearts). however, the sleepless have issued many warnings against traveling there. a strange storm generally prevents ships from reaching the islands, often causing them to be lost at sea. even so, the sleepless have added additional precautions; akinah is surrounded by forty-foot-tall soulcast stone spikes and a fake city sits atop the buried oathgate as a failsafe and distraction. in the rare instances where a ship has had a realistic attempt to make landfall, the sleepless have personally intervened, using sabotage or murder to halt their progress. through these measures, the sleepless maintained the secrets of the islands for many centuries, until they eventually came to an agreement with rysn ftori during the expedition to akinah in 1174. notes[edit]"
Mandra,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Mandra,"mandras are a type of spren on roshar. in the physical realm they are called luckspren, chasmspren or apaliki'tokoa'a. in shadesmar, they are used for transportation. appearance[edit] shadesmar[edit] mandras have triangular shaped heads, which are the exact same shape as those that are found near greatshells in the physical realm. they come in a variety of sizes; the ones used for pulling ships in shadesmar are much larger than luckspren that appear in the physical realm. their bodies are long, sinuous with multiple sets of legs and multiple sets of undulating wings along their bodies. the wings move at a regular rhythm. physical realm[edit] luckspren have the appearance of tiny, blue, arrowhead-like fish that dart around the creature they're swarming in the general direction of its travel. the shape of their heads correspond to the triangular heads of the mandras. luckspren are often found near greatshells, chasmfiends, skyeels, anything that is lighter than it appears to be. they appear in swarms around skyeels. when they disappear from the physical realm it is like a small plume of smoke rising into the air. abilities[edit] mandras are the spren who bond with greatshells, chasmfiends, and larkin, preventing them from being crushed under their own weight. this was discovered by bavamar with mathematical calculations. mandras from different locations can be different sizes and strengths, and a greatshell may need to return multiple times during their lifecycle to bond additional mandras so they can continue growing. mandras seem to avoid the rules of physics and their wings are not the source of their locomotion. they can be pushed to exhaustion. mandras have a tendency to vanish, called ""dropping"". this is occurs when they get pulled into the physical realm. they cannot be removed from human population centres for long as they begin to waste away and die. why this happens is unknown to the lightspren who use them to pull their ships. mandras are seen to be used in shadesmar to pull ships by lightspren, honorspren, and most likely anyone other ship crew as every ship in celebrant has them. they are harnessed with a set of pulleys on either side of their body. to steer them in either direction the sailors shorten one of the pulleys and tie it off on cleats connected to the sides of the ship. the mandras hooked to the honorspren ship have golden harnesses and they employ more than just two, having mandras attached to wings on the side of their ship. because of mandras' tendency to ""drop"" the sailors always employ at least two mandras so they do not end up stranded. once the ships have docked the mandras are detached from the ship using long hooks and lead away. adolin wonders if they are attached to the stern of the ship to pull them from the docks but given that adolin is alethi, a people who are infamous for knowing little about sailing, this is to be taken with a grain of salt. mandras do not seem to like fire. their sailors try to control and move them away when ico's ship is burning. mythology[edit] legends tell of luckspren leading to treasure. notes[edit]"
Hallandren,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Iridescent_Tones,"""“this, however, was hallandren: land of returned gods, lifeless servants, biochromatic research, and-of course-color. ”-vasher"" hallandren is the most powerful kingdom on nalthis. its capital is t'telir. it is unique for its jungle environment and the tears of edgli, which grow nowhere else. it is home to the hallandren iridescent tones, the religion that supports and is led by the returned. geography and ecology[edit] ""“a paradise hidden between the mountains, a land with pleasant rains that never grew cold, a land where succulent food grew spontaneously. ”-hoid telling what the chedesh thought when they first landed on hallandren's beaches"" hallandren is located in the jungle valley on nalthis. it is unique in the known world of nalthis as being the only place that tears of edgli will grow, as well as being the only known jungle climate. the growth of plants in this region is partly helped by investiture, much like the elendel basin. to hallandren's east, there is an inland sea that features several islands. at least a third of the coastline is controlled by hallandren, which has its capital city built abutting the water. the area suffers frequent earthquakes. there are mountains north of hallandren, as well as toward the sunrise. to the south of hallandren is the province of pahn kahl. elephants and zebras are said to be exotic creatures from ""the south."" whether this means they come from southern hallandren or south of hallandren is unclear. the hallandren jungle is inhabited by panthers, parrots, monkeys, and crocodiles. the hallandren people have access to fine wines, sweet potatoes, figs, nuts, and garlic, among other foods; it is unknown, however, how much grows in the area and how much is imported. the bright sea is full of life, including many sorts of mussels, fish, and tentacled creatures. government and religion[edit] ""“the hallandren theocracy is a top-heavy structure laden with bureaucratic foolishness and inertia. ”-vasher"" hallandren is a theocracy ruled by the pantheon of the returned, headed by the god king. the iridescent tones, which grew out of the cult of the returned, is the religion behind this theocracy, and is responsible for the worship and care of the hallandren returned. each returned is given a palace in the court of gods in t'telir, and served by a group of attendants and priests. the priests organize the interactions between the returned and the citizens, including the weekly offering of breath that the returned require to survive and the daily hearing of petitions. as part of the government, each returned is assigned specific administrative duties, such as maintaining the city sewers or commanding part of the army. the god king can nominally make any decision he pleases, but in reality much of the day-to-day government decisions are made by the priests of the various gods. a new god king is selected when an infant returns. the god king’s priests take an infant returning as a sign that it’s time to change god kings. they then choose a wife for the god king and hope she has a child, as they would rather have the god king's literal child. retired god king's are proclaimed dead from healing those in need and are taken to one of the isles in the middle of the inner sea. they maintain a lavish lifestyle until they die. there is a holiday known as gods feast, on which people take the evening off and feast. when siri first meets treledees she describes him as wearing a deep robe with massive peaked shoulders, making it look like armour, and a matching headdress. this may be the general clothing for a hallandren priest, however it is more likely he wears it due to his function as high priest of the god king rather then it being a standard for priests. the iridescent tones[edit] when people die, they go across something called the iridescent wave, going into the afterlife. the iridescent tones are multiple entities. each god represents an ideal.the iridescent tones teach that the returned are people who have died, then seen some event or have knowledge about the afterlife, and then decided to come back, blessing the people and giving knowledge about the future. the returned come back with a goal, although they forget it; leaping over the iridescent wave leaves the mind fragmented. the petitions are meant to help the gods remember why they came back. not everyone can return, only those who died in a way that is courageous, honest, brave, etc. can return. court assembly[edit] the court assembly is a standing commission of the court of gods that provides decisions to hallandren's citizens. it meets daily to make small judgments, but important discussions are reserved for weekly meetings of the full assembly. the assembly is made up primarily of priests and priestesses, and meetings are held in a large arena at the back of the court of gods. the returned do not sit on the assembly, but many of them regularly attend the weekly meetings to watch from ornate stone observation boxes, including susebron. some returned do not concern themselves with politics and rarely attend, while others find the meetings boring because they believe their opinions do not matter. during assembly meetings, arguments are brought forth regarding various topics such as relations with idris; siri was also presented to the court at the assembly. the assembly's discussions are often full of rhetoric and politically savvy returned try to influence the direction of the assembly. attending the court assembly is thought of as a privilege by the people of hallandren; there are only four benches in the arena for citizens to attend, so only people who are rich, influential, favored by a god, or have at least fifty breaths attend regularly. average citizens may enter a lottery to win a token to attend the assembly. main assembly[edit] the regular court assembly is not empowered to make major decisions such as a declaration of war; instead, all of the returned must attend a gathering known as a ""main"" or ""general"" assembly so they can all cast a vote. these special assemblies are rare and often very crowded, as citizens who win lottery tokens to attend an assembly often save them for a main assembly so they can see all of the gods together. military[edit] the hallandren lifeless army was split into four sections of ten thousand troops, each commanded by a different returned in the pantheon. they are kept underground in darkness and have people to maintain and exercise them. the commanders prior to the pahn kahl rebellion were lightsong, hopefinder, allmother and mercystar. blushweaver convinced mercystar to share her command phrase and traded her vote on the council of social ills to hopefinder in exchange for his command phrase; she later changes both of their command phrases, thus giving her sole control over half of the nation's lifeless. blushweaver attempted to do the same with allmother, but failed to persuade her. lightsong, however, gained allmother's trust based on their former association with calmseer, and they shared their command phrases with each other. lightsong withheld these phrases from blushweaver, and later changed both command phrases to one that only he knew, leaving him with sole control over half the total forces of hallandren. during the pahn kahl rebellion, blushweaver was tortured by the rebels until she gave them her command phrase. upon seeing blushweaver die, lightsong despondently gave up his new command phrase out of fear for llarimar's life. there are also human city guards, but the bulk of the army is still lifeless. additionally, the support structure for the army proper is composed of humans. history[edit] founding[edit] the valley where halladren is now located was discovered by the sea-faring people of the chedesh. the tropical climate and abundance of food made the region a paradise compared to the mountains and deserts elsewhere. the sailors founded a kingdom known as hanald on the shores of the inner sea. the only other inhabitants of the jungle were the native pahn kahl people, whose ""kingdom"" was in reality a collection of fishing villages. the first returned[edit] the first returned, vo, was born during this time. it was the people on his ship who founded hanald. he declared the five visions before dying a week later. his wife became the first queen of hanald, and governed over the kingdom's early days. expansion[edit] the tears of edgli are a unique resource only available in hallandren. the flowers produce dyes that work in any cloth and have a very vibrant color. the kingdom used this to their advantage, trading the unique dyes to other kingdoms. a vast mercantile effort combined with the opening of the northern passes made hallandren rich. they controlled a lucrative region, and this gave them powerful bargaining power. the manywar[edit] roughly 300 years before the the pahn kahl rebellion, the manywar was started by hallandren. while accounts differ over the real start of the war, they all revolve around the creation of the single-breath lifeless and the other discoveries of the five scholars. kalad the usurper took control of hallandren in some fashion, and started the war for unknown reason. eventually, peacegiver stopped the war by bringing kalad's phantoms (which formed the bulk of the army) to take control of the kingdom. at the conclusion of the manywar, the returned were firmly established as the rulers of hallandren. furthermore, the royal family (descendants of the first queen) was exiled to idris. peacegiver also gave the first god king a treasure of fifty thousand breaths and entrusted his priests to see that it was cared for until he needed it again. the pahn kahl rebellion[edit] three hundred years later, a pahn kahl named vahr made an attempt at stirring up his people. he spent over a decade working to that that end, but was ultimately captured and imprisoned due to bluefingers' information leaks and killed by vasher. bluefingers himself planned an extensive subversive campaign centered around starting a war between hallandren and idris: he brought mercenaries and pahn kahl awakeners into the tunnel system below the court, manipulated siri into distrusting the hallandren priests, and hired denth's crew to increase tensions in the city. when his plans were nearing completion, he tortured blushweaver and lightsong in order to get the command phrases for hallandren's lifeless army, changed the command phrase, and sent the army towards idris. the attempted rebellion was defeated when the god king, with his newly healed tongue, used peacegiver's treasure to storm his palace with an army of awakened cloths. vasher decided to give the god king the command phrase to kalad's phantoms, which he then sent after the lifeless army. culture[edit] hallandren and its inhabitants live a very colorful life, as they are sitting on the tears of edgli. t'telir, in particular, is famous for having color everywhere and anywhere it can be displayed. society is fairly well-off, with a middle class that doesn't exist anywhere else with similar technological development. coins in hallandren are called marks, with a smaller variety called bits. a single bit would not buy more than a mouthful of food. skilled artists of at least the third heightening often write poetry using the artisan's script. hallandren's society places value in athleticism. duels for sport are common enough that someone talented with a blade could gain a wealth of prizes, notable fame, and a sizable following of students in their lifetime. the court of hallandren's arena is often used as a location for athletic individuals to engage in contests of physical prowess. some arena competitions mentioned are shot put, javelin toss, archery, leaping contests, and races. however, special accolades are not given to the winner, but to all the contestants, for possessing the physical prowess required to participate. the hallandren may have a calendar which views the manywar as the year 0, as hoid mentions that the time before the manywar was before time itself began.[citation needed] the hallandren people enjoy music, painting, dance, poetry, sculpture, puppetry, play performance, sandpainting and lots of other ‘lesser’ arts. the hallandren herd livestock such as sheep and cows. they also eat figs and many sorts of sealife, such as mussels, fish, and octopi. silk is commonly used as clothing for the highborn.[citation needed] the people at the edges of the kingdom of hallandren, have dark skin, however since siri notes this, it may be that the people at the northern border have dark skin. people here also dye their hair.[citation needed] their language is called hallandren as well.[citation needed] economics[edit] when hallandren was still known as hanald, the kingdom had little of note economically, until the tears of edgli were found. these flowers quickly turned the country into an economic powerhouse. t'telir's location on the bright sea made it easy to access hallandren textiles and dyes, which quickly turned the city of t'telir into a prime port and a center of trade for all kingdoms in nalthis. while the bright sea's trade routes are a boon to hallandren, they only connect hallandren to the southern kingdoms, which do not provide nearly enough income for the kingdom as a whole. for hallandren to thrive, it needs access to trade routes to the northern kingdoms, which are monopolized by idris. bebid postulates that a drawn out war with idris would cut off their primary trade routes and would lead to ""full economic collapse."" priests control much of the trade in the city. being wealthy individuals with notable political power in hallandren's theocracy, they own and organize a large sum of the traded goods in hallandren. there were strict rules around buying and selling breath. truthcall is one of the returned given a vote over issues of trade with other kingdoms. as such, his decisions hold sway over the economics of both hallandren and its trade partners.

Bisig,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Bisig,"bisig is a member of bridge four. appearance and personality[edit] bisig is thin with an angular face and doesn't speak much. despite being quite reserved, he is close to becoming betrothed. attributes and abilities[edit] as a windrunner, bisig has surgebinding abilities, including healing powers and flight through the use of basic lashings. he has at least a basic knowledge of towers, and thinks rlain is good at the game due to his skill at bluffing. history[edit] bisig was a member of bridge four under torol sadeas; it is not known why he was assigned to bridge duty. he was the last member of bridge four to join in with the reforms that kaladin brought, and likely only conformed because of rock's and teft's threats, not out of loyalty. after the crew gave rock a razor as a gift, he was one of the two men to get hugged by the horneater. bisig was one of the guards during the highstorm prior to the balcony collapsing on elhokar, but was dismissed prior to the actual attack. when he got back to the barracks, he joined in with the others to discuss how they missed carrying their bridge. he and most of the rest of bridge four were among the expedition to find stormseat. bisig survived the battle of narak, although he lost the use of his right hand to a shardblade wound during szeth's attack on dalinar. his upcoming marriage was one of several situations that sigzil brought up to kaladin in order to get him to think about how he would accommodate the men as they branched out in different directions from being simple slaves. bisig became a windrunner squire to kaladin along with the rest of bridge four, which granted him access to stormlight and the ability to heal his hand injury. he crashed into the ceiling during practice one time while trying to imitate lopen, prompting skar to feel jealous of his ability to draw in stormlight at all. when taravangian sent an assassin to recover jezrien's honorblade from bridge four, bisig was badly wounded in the conflict, suffering another shardblade injury, this time to his arm. he survived, however, and came to long enough to describe how the perpetrator had been wearing teft's lieutenant's coat. bisig presumably joined in the offensive in emul with most of the other windrunners, and wasn’t present during the occupation of urithiru. trivia[edit] - bisig is a cameo for a friend or family member of brandon's. - a possible inspiration is a couple named geoff and rachel biesinger who are mentioned in the acknowledgements of - . notes[edit]"
Ivis,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ivis,"ivis is an ardent and swordmaster who serves house kholin on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] like most ardents, she has a shaved head and flowing robes. she wears a glove on her safehand. attributes and abilities[edit] ivis appears to be one of alethkar's most skilled ardents with a sword. zahel and kelerand, two expert swordsmen, fully trust her to perform training without their direct supervision. dalinar also knows her by name and trusts her with important tasks. she can handle a shardblade and is highly familiar with all ten stances, which is unusual for a woman in alethkar. history[edit] shattered plains[edit] ivis is one of many ardents that reported to zahel on the lighteyed training grounds in dalinar kholin's warcamp on the shattered plains. zahel assigned her to spar with bridge four using one of the king's shardblades, hoping to familiarize them with the stances used by shardbearers, should they ever have to fight one. although ivis's robes concealed her figure, kaladin considered the sight of a woman holding a shardblade to be odd, although it was no odder than seeing a darkeyes hold one. ivis had bridge four use pieces of wood as practice swords and walked them through the stances. after about an hour, they took a break; ivis told yake and teft to stop dawdling and come back to practice, but she did not call kaladin, who seemed to intimidate the ardents. after kaladin rejoined the group and continued practicing, ivis corrected his grip, and laughed when she realized he had expected to learn swordsmanship very swiftly. urithiru[edit] ivis relocated to urithiru after the battle of narak. she continued to train soldiers, now reporting to kelerand instead of zahel. dalinar told kelerand to have ivis expand the training grounds in urithiru to keep the soldiers occupied. notes[edit]"
Hobber,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Hobber,"""“being a radiant isn't so much about your strength or skill, but about your heart. and yours is the best of all of us. ”-kaladin to hobber"" hobber is a member of bridge four and a windrunner. appearance and personality[edit] hobber is round-faced and lean. he has a gap between his teeth and short black hair. he has a tattoo on his forehead to cover up his slave’s brand. hobber is frequently one of the more positive men in bridge four, always supporting kaladin and the rest of the men. he likes to joke with the others and help wherever he can, even when he is severely injured. he follows the passions. attributes and abilities[edit] hobber is a windrunner of at least the second ideal. he has the ability to draw in stormlight and use the surges of adhesion and gravitation. history[edit] hobber was assigned to the bridge crews after getting into a drunken brawl along with his squad. while he was probably just going along with that the others were doing, a man ended up dead, and he was punished accordingly. rescued by kaladin[edit] during kaladin’s first run as bridgeleader, he found an injured hobber laying beside the bridge. he had taken an arrow through the thigh and was moaning in pain. kaladin grabbed him under the arms and pulled him to safety. determining that the arrow hadn’t hit any major arteries, kaladin returned to the battlefield to retrieve more injured bridgemen. after tending to the more severe injuries, kaladin returned to hobber and cleaned, stitched, and bound his wound. kaladin ordered the men to tie hobber and dabbid to the top of the bridge so they could transport them back. when kaladin checked on the wounded, hobber was smiling openly. he thanked kaladin for saving him. kaladin told him he wouldn’t be able to walk for a few weeks, but that he would bring him food from the mess hall. hobber just thanked him again, taking his hand, almost tearing up. kaladin moved on to dabbid and hobber told kaladin that he’d been sitting like that all night. hobber thought he’d been hit in the head, but kaladin disagreed, calling it battle shock and that it would wear off. hobber just hoped he was right. after a few weeks, thanks to the food and antiseptic kaladin was able to get, hobber limped out of the barrack and joined the rest of bridge four for their first pot of stew. before long, hobber could walk without his crutch and it wouldn’t be long before he could start running bridges again. in the meantime, lopen recruited him, along with dabbid, to help carry water for the rest of bridge four. bridge four tattoos[edit] ""“no, sir. i wasn’t freed from bridge four. i was freed by it. i wouldn’t trade my time there for anything.”-while getting his tattoo"" when bridge four decided to get tattoos, hobber was the first one to jump at the chance as he was the very first one to believe in kaladin. even during the painful process, hobber kept a grin on his face. as the tattooist finished, hobber asked what it meant. sigzil answered that it meant “freedom.” hobber said that it was good, but not good enough. he wanted “bridge four” added to it, because bridge four was what freed him. while kaladin didn’t understand it, he drew the glyphs anyways so they could be added to hobber’s tattoo. once hobber was finished, the others requested the same. hobber, along with the rest of bridge four, objected when the tattooist said she couldn’t tattoo shen because he was property. the tattooist gave in and before long, all of bridge four, with the exception of kaladin, whose ink wouldn’t take, had the matching “bridge four” tattoo. encountering the assassin in white[edit] kaladin, after receiving warning from syl that there was darkness in the palace, assigned hobber and beld to an advance squad in charge of scouting a way out of the building. the two men scouted ahead, but they ran into szeth. szeth cut down hobber, leaving his legs darkened and grey, dead. he then stabbed beld through, killing him. after fighting szeth, kaladin found hobber weeping. he apologized to kaladin and explained what happened. kaladin tried to reassure him, but hobber told him he couldn’t feel his legs, that he was useless. kaladin objected firmly and told him he would always be bridge four. kaladin offered that they could have rock teach him how to cook. hobber countered that he was an awful cook, but kaladin just told him he’d fit in with most military cooks. kaladin then tried to lift hobber, but his body objected. he sucked in stormlight and then carried hobber back towards the others. hobber fell into his new role of helping rock in the kitchen, serving the men of bridge four while rock looked on proudly. he kept his grey legs covered with a blanket, sitting on a stump the men had fashioned for him. kaladin nodded to hobber and raised a fist, encouraging him to fight on. a miracle[edit] ""“i don't know if...i mean, sir, i'm no radiant. i was never that good with the spear. i'm barely a passable cook. ”-hobber to kaladin"" hobber continued to find his place in the kitchen as rock’s assistant chef once the rest of bridge four moved to urithiru after the battle of narak. one day, he traveled with the rest of bridge four and other prospective windrunners to the shattered plains for training. while assisting rock in the kitchen, kaladin walked over to hobber and handed him a gemstone. kaladin explained he had to breathe in the stormlight, something he himself hadn’t really known he was doing until teft explained it to him. hobber objected, saying he wasn’t that good with the spear and barely a passable cook. however, it was a job he could do after his was injured by the assassin in white, and rock was happy to have his help. kaladin folded the gemstone in hobber’s fingers and just asked him to try, explaining that being a knight radiant wasn’t about strength or skill as much as it was about heart. kaladin told hobber that his heart was the best of all of them. a short time later, rock returned to the kitchen and went to hand hobber the plates so they could begin distributing the food. however, hobber didn’t respond to his request. rather, he was focused on the gemstone in his hand. the energy changed and several windspren turned towards hobber. in a moment, it seemed like everything else had faded as hobber’s fist began to glow. rock shouted and hobber jumped in surprise. his jaw dropped and he stared at the now-dun sphere. he held up his hand and shouted at the other men. ""“i can feel them again! i can feel my toes!”-being healed"" the bridgemen came rushing over and kaladin ordered them to give all their gemstones to hobber. the men scrambled to give hobber their gemstones, and the lights dampened. hobber cried that he could feel his toes again. he reached out for support, and drehy and peet helped him slip off his stool, righting him. he finally forced them back, standing precariously on his own. the men of bridge four celebrated, and lopen gave the bridge four salute. it seemed to be something special coming from him, one of the first times lopen had been able to make the salute. hobber saluted back. falling into routine[edit] as more and more people took to the skies and joined the windrunners, many felt like things were changing faster than they would have liked for them to. hobber admitted that he was afraid he couldn’t keep up with the others, which led to many others confessing their fears. rock reminded them that while they were all afraid and felt alone, they all shared those fears and could be alone together. hobber and the others found this comforting, with hobber even slapping rlain on the back. bridge four continued to settle into their windrunner and guard duties, with hobber and others sharing guard duty. while accompanying dalinar and navani to a meeting, the latter apologized for how boring it must have been. hobber and leyten both confessed they liked boring, because that meant no one was trying to kill them that day. relationships[edit] kaladin[edit] having been rescued by kaladin, hobber never wavers in his support of or devotion to the bridgeleader. he supports his efforts and is even the first to get a bridge four tattoo to cover up his slave brand. kaladin, while strong most of the time, almost seems near tears whenever he talks to hobber after his injury at the hands of szeth. when kaladin encourages hobber to try to breathe in stormlight, he tells hobber that he has one of the best hearts of all of them. rock[edit] rock, or lunamor, embraces having hobber’s support in the kitchen even though he is barely passable as a cook. after his injury that left him with dead legs, hobber jokes that he could burn broth. however, rock appreciates his help, stating that he can always find the man where he left him. notes[edit]"
Malop,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Malop,"malop is a member of bridge four on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] he has thick, black hair and a bushy beard. his hands are both tattooed with a glyphward. he isn't considered very smart, and he has limited knowledge of the world beyond alethkar. history[edit] during kaladin's first run leading bridge four, malop was one of the last men to get into position. he was killed by the parshendi during the battle of the tower. he suffered a severe axe wound to the arm and subsequently lost too much blood. kaladin regretted being unable to save malop, jaks, and narm during the battle. malop was one of the many people that kaladin remembered being unable to protect while he was trying to swear the fourth ideal of the windrunners. notes[edit]"
Dunny,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Dunny,"dunny is a member of bridge four on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] dunny is a darkeyed, spindly youth. he is skinnier than most of bridge four, with kaladin thinking how he couldn’t use dunny as an example because of his size. according to sigzil, dunny’s eyes are dark violet, hinting that he may have been veden (rather than alethi). he is babyfaced, hardly needing a shave at all. at first, dunny is quite shy until he sings with rock during chasm duty. after that, he walks around with more confidence, talking to the others more. history[edit] dunny was an apprentice before he found himself in bridge four. while he didn’t go into much detail about his past, dunny admitted that his master beat him for not remembering to use titles to address those of higher stature. during his first run as bridgeleader, kaladin didn’t want to leave his injured men behind. he recruited a young dunny to heat the knife, which he used to treat a wounded leyten. on stone gathering duty, dunny approached with earless jaks towing a wooden sled bearing a large stone. the pair helped kaladin put the stone in the wagon. kaladin thanked them, to which dunny just shrugged. when bridge four was assigned to chasm duty, kaladin, rock, and teft discussed duels back on the peaks. seeing that dunny was moving closer to listen, kaladin asked him a question, startling the youth. rock chuckled and asked if he knew the meaning of his name. dunny didn’t know, which made him feel like an outsider especially knowing rock’s name meant a whole sentence. rock told him that on the peaks, everyone’s name is a poem. hearing that, dunny hesitated, but then spoke his own poem. ""“hey you big buffoon, you smell like a wet hog, so go out by the moon, and jump yourself in the bog.”-dunny’s poem during chasm duty "" rock laughed riotously and kaladin commented that it sounded like a song. dunny admitted that he put it to the tune of “mari’s two lover’s” to get the beat right. hearing the mention of a song, rock asked dunny to sing for them. after a yelp of protest, dunny obeyed. his voice was pure tenor as he sang, appearing more confident in song than in voice. rock joined in and sang the harmony. when they finished, teft applauded and rock said it was good to meet a lowlander that could sing. dunny blushed, but he walked more confidently after their compliments, his shyness fading. that evening, dunny helped rock prepare the stew and the two sang songs for the rest of bridge four. from then on, dunny continued to support kaladin and the rest of bridge four. he helped with the stew and was vocal in kaladin’s plan to fight and escape. he also tended to be more outspoken about his past even telling the others a story about the first girl he kissed. unfortunately, dunny was killed in a bridge run soon after. once kaladin's crew had set their bridge, sadeas's troops started fighting the parshendi. in the battle, one of sadeas' archers accidentally shot dunny in the shoulder. before kaladin could reach him, he was struck again in the opposing side by a parshendi arrow, killing him instantly. kaladin tried again to get to him, but moash pulled him back, saying there was nothing he could do. dunny’s death had a profound impact on kaladin as he considered the bridgemen to be a friend and one of the first to support him. however, kaladin knew there was nothing he could do for him, so he focused on healing the injured from other bridge crews. right before swearing the second ideal, kaladin remembered dunny along with maps, amark, goshel, dallet, nalma, tukks, nelda, and tien. notes[edit]"

Knights Radiant,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Squire,"""“""i'm not some glorious knight of ancient days. i'm a broken man. do you hear me, syl? i'm broken.""she zipped up to him and whispered, ""that’s what they all were, silly"" ”-kaladin and syl on what the knights radiant were like."" the knights radiant (parshendi: neshua kadal) were an organization of surgebinders on roshar. their orders were centered at urithiru, but they lived all across alethela, the silver kingdom who had to maintain the arts of war. they considered it their duty and privilege to stay vigilant for desolations. it is commonly believed that they betrayed mankind on the day of recreance, and were then referred to as the lost radiants. their symbol was a golden hourglass shape, of eight spheres connected with two at the center. history[edit] ""“they were a solution, a way to offset the destruction of the desolations. ten orders of knights, founded with the purpose of helping men fight, then rebuild.”-dalinar's visions"" the first surgebinders came to be as a result of spren trying to imitate what honor had given his heralds. the spren formed bonds with the mankind to give them surgebinding abilities. honor was surprised by their coming, because he hadn't taught it to his heralds. these surgebinders were later formed into the ten orders of the knights radiant by the herald ishi'elin, for the purpose of watching for the coming desolations, and helping men fight, then rebuild the society from the destruction of the desolations, and they adopted the city of urithiru as their center of power. for a long time, they maintained their duty, until eventually they abandoned it on what is now known as the day of recreance, and possibly even turned against their wards, as some legends say. this betrayal caused many spren to die, their corpses becoming tools of destruction, and as a result they stopped granting humanity surgebinding. in recent times, sensing an impending danger, the spren started returning to mankind as an act of self-preservation. people all over roshar started gaining surgebinding powers by forming nahel bonds with the spren in the following years. at the beginning of the year 1174, urithiru was reclaimed, and the knights radiant were re-founded with initially four members; kaladin, shallan davar, dalinar kholin, and renarin kholin. radiant orders and powers[edit] the knights radiant comprised ten different orders, some of which had several hundred members. each order had two surges associated with it, and each surge was used by two different orders. scholars associated the ten orders with the ten essences as well. each order corresponded to a herald, and all of them except the bondsmiths roughly correspond to an unmade, though it is not entirely a one to one relationship. the knights radiant also used shardblades and shardplate, which were etched with glyphs and glowed a different color according to the order they were a part of. not all radiants have access to shards and many orders don't receive them until they have sworn the higher ideals. squires[edit] many orders of the knights are able to grant the ability to use stormlight and some of their surges to people, possibly those capable of becoming knights themselves. it appears that potential squires must have a mindset that matches at least partly with the requirements of the order. for windrunners this appears to be a mental state geared to protection. many squires recite the first ideal before gaining surgebinding, but this is not required. each order follows a path and with a knight willing to help the first steps can be taken before bonding a spren themselves. this shows the spren what people are good candidates for each order, and reducing the chance that a spren will die from failed oaths. time as a squire also allows a person to practice surgebinding before gaining a nahel bond. it is possible for a person to remain a squire their whole life, or to be a squire of one order and bond a spren from another. using a mix of other investiture (such as feruchemy and hemalurgy), a surgebinder could hack the magic and be a squire of multiple orders at once. the powers of a squire are tied to a particular radiant and their spren, and without their presence, a squire cannot draw in stormlight to surgebind, even if another full knight of the same order is present. squires must be within approximately fifty miles of their radiant to use their powers, although they begin to weaken once they are separated by thirty miles or more. if their radiant were to suddenly separate from them, such as by using an oathgate, a squire's powers would last between one to two hours. while it has been said that some orders may not have squires, the windrunners, skybreakers, dustbringers, lightweavers, willshapers, stonewards, and bondsmiths are known to have squires. immortal words[edit] ""“life before death. strength before weakness. journey before destination. ”-the first ideal of the knights radiant"" the ideals of the knights radiant, known as the immortal words, serve as a guide for the radiants' actions and lives. each order of radiants has five ideals, though different radiants from the same order may swear an ideal with slightly different words and lightweavers swear more individualized truths instead of ideals. the wording of the first ideal, however, is exact and is used by all orders, including the lightweavers. it appears that it is not necessary to speak the first ideal as a complete uninterrupted phrase, as when navani kholin spoke them to bond the sibling, she spread the three sentences throughout the length of a conversation, and though he was unable to complete the ideal before being killed, elhokar kholin stuttered and repeated its words. the first ideal acts as a motto and guide for the radiants as a whole, and is known as the ideal of radiance by the skybreakers, who may have carried the name over from the ancient radiants. the unique ideals of each order are designed as a progression that develops a radiant's character toward the central concepts of their order. the stormfather and cultivation have some discretion in deciding whether or not a radiant has progressed enough that their oath can be accepted, though this discretion appears to be limited. it is unclear whether or not the stormfather had this ability prior to honor's splintering, but it seems likely it was instead honor's decision at this time. a bondsmith may also be able to accept the oaths of other orders. as a radiant swears additional ideals, they gain their shardblade and shardplate (though the ideal at which these are received is not the same for all orders) and become more efficient in their use of stormlight. additionally, some orders cannot use one of their surges until they swear a higher ideal. swearing the fifth ideal, also known as the final ideal, makes the nahel bond between radiant and spren so strong that it can only be broken by death; until that point, there are apparently safe ways to break the bond. swearing the fifth ideal is generally not necessary to be considered a full knight radiant and is such a difficult process that the order of the skybreakers has not had someone swear the fifth ideal for centuries. ideals must be sworn in order, even if a radiant is ready to swear a higher ideal than the one they cannot currently swear. radiants must also be ready to swear the ideals, and cannot just say the words to advance. vorinism[edit] in vorinism, the fall of the knights radiant was called the day of recreance. they are taught to be evil people who turned against humanity, and are thus given the moniker ""lost radiants."" vorinism taught that the knights radiant betrayed the people. it was taught that their powers were not real, but elaborate tricks, and that they only pretended to have a holy calling. the ""evidence"" for this was that the powers could not be reproduced. there are legends that teach about the souls of the knights radiant arriving during highstorms in order to steal spheres left out to be infused. this was used as a way to explain both spheres being stolen by thieves in the dark, and how the winds of the highstorm often tore baskets off their posts and flung them into the distance. notable knights radiant[edit] trivia[edit] - brandon intended for sets of ideals across orders (e.g. the third ideal) to have a theme, though not all oaths will follow the pattern. - the term for a knight radiant in parshendi is neshua kadal, possibly related to the hebrew words נִשְׁבָּע (""nishba"") meaning ""one who makes oaths"" or נִשָּׁבַע (""nishuva"") meaning ""one who was sworn to"" and קטל (""katal"") meaning ""kill"" (a reference to the killing of - ). notes[edit]"
Halam Khal,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Captain_Khal,"captain halam khal is a lighteyed officer and shardbearer in the kholin army on roshar. he is the eldest son of general khal and brightness teshav. appearance and personality[edit] little is known about halam khal's appearance. his eyes are light, either yellow or violet depending on which of his parents he takes after. like all alethi, he's tan. even his kinsmen consider him tall. khal is a dependable soldier. his father trusts him with his set of shards, and often leaves him to act on his own, trusting--rightfully so--that the captain will succeed. halam has been taught to take on any challenge that arises, even if the opponent is his superior. when not in battle or fulfilling other duties, he is usually seen close by his father's side. attributes and abilities[edit] halam is a trained soldier with considerable skill. he is present in most major engagements during the war of reckoning and the true desolation and comes out of them essentially unscathed. he's also a trained shardbearer, and though he does not have plate or a blade of his own, he is skilled in using his father's weapons. it's possible, however, that general khal ends up bestowing his own plate on him, as following the battle of narak others refer to halam as a shardbearer, and he is seen wearing his father's plate far more often than his father is. as his father's eldest son, halam is the heir to the khal lands, if they still exist. history[edit] nothing is known of halam khal's early life except that he was born to general khal and brightness teshav. like many alethi brightlords, he joined the military, and by 1173 he reached the rank of captain. he was a member of the war party led by dalinar kholin out onto the shattered plains to fight the parshendi. he fought in the battle of narak along with the less-skilled armies on highprince roion's front. for this, his father lent him his own shardplate and shardblade. despite captain khal's best efforts, roion's troops were routed by the parshendi. trapped and nearly overwhelmed, halam was rescued when brightlady navani's artifabrians put their moisture-attracting fabrials into action, allowing archers to give khal and his men cover as they retreated. captain khal returned from the front on foot, bearing teleb's borrowed king's blade, which he had recovered from the other man's corpse. he was sent to another part of the battlefield immediately upon his return. halam survived the battle and came to urithiru along with the rest of his family. at some point, the princess of yezier began courting him, perhaps in hopes of tying her country to the kholins and their military. he and his father briefly visited thaylen city, but before the battle of thaylen field began, they transferred back to urithiru to gather their soldiers and were subsequently stuck there when the tower came under attack from the fused. after that assault was pushed back, they led an alethi relief force consisting of two thousand sodiers and three shardbearers to aid thaylen city. the captain survived that battle as well. trivia[edit] - halam goes unnamed throughout the entirety of - , being referred to only as ""captain khal"". notes[edit]"
Shardhammer,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Shardhammer,"a shardhammer, also known as a warhammer is an enormous battle hammer that can only be wielded by someone in shardplate. contrary to what it's name might suggest, it is not an ancient magical weapon like shardplate or a shardblade, but rather, a more modern creation. dalinar's warhammer is described as having a haft as ""thick as a man's wrist"" with the front of the head being larger than a man's fist. it could barely be lifted by two men and was carried on a cart. a shardbearer's hammer is a common weapon for someone who owns a set of plate, but no shardblade. notable mentions[edit] dalinar used his warhammer to dig a latrine ditch as he contemplated stepping down as highprince. sadeas recalls an incident one year after the assassination of gavilar in which he slaughtered a large number of parshendi with only his hammer. when adolin posed as dalinar to meet with eshonai on the shattered plains, teleb wore a shardhammer strapped to his back. on a plateau run where adolin assists other highprinces in a failed attempt to collect a gemheart, jakamav carries a shardhammer as a member of his team. during adolin's duel-gone-bad, elit wears the king's borrowed shardplate and fights with a shardbearer's hammer. before either had shardblades, dalinar and sadeas both use warhammers as their primary weapon. specifically during the battle of the rift. during the battle of thaylen field hrdalm uses a warhammer while battling a thunderclast with adolin. notes[edit]"
Ethan Skarstedt,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ethan_Skarstedt,"ethan skarstedt is an author who occasionally works with brandon sanderson. he co-wrote a short story with him in the armored anthology, and was involved in the production of adamant (originally the lurker), before brandon bought the full rights due to time constraints between the two authors. he is a longtime friend of brandon's and the pair are in a writing group together. he is the namesake of the character skar. notes[edit]"
Shanay-im,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Heavenly_Ones,"the shanay-im, translated as those ones of the heavens and often referred to simply as heavenly ones, are a brand of fused who can use the surge of gravitation. abilities[edit] the shanay-im are fused who can manipulate the surge of gravitation. fused of this brand can manipulate their own gravity without expending voidlight, but must use it to heal themselves or to lash things other than themselves. these abilities are similar to the basic lashing used by the windrunners and skybreaker. shanay-im are often seen manipulating the gravitation vector of both themselves and other bodies and objects, resulting in abilities such as flight, reduced weight, and sending their enemies flying off into the air. the fused accelerate more slowly than surgebinders when using gravitation. this is due to them expending less energy and does not have to do with the gravity of braize. over a large span, fused will go faster than surgebinders. fused can only lash themselves once. these fused are able to enter space, but cannot travel far, since they would require a large amount of voidlight to heal due to the lack of air and pressure. culture[edit] shanay-im usually wear extremely long robes, trailing behind them several feet. they utilize long lances suited for aerial combat, with aluminum coating to block shardblades. the lances also incorporate raysium to drain stormlight from radiants. when fighting windrunners, they hold an honorable tradition of one-to-one dueling. they raise their weapons to those they wish to duel, and engage upon consent from the windrunners. the rest of their members float about and do not interfere with the duel. the windrunners play along with the tradition, as the windrunners have a smaller number and this prevents them from being ganged up on. this tradition does not extend to normal soldiers. high chambers[edit] after the fused capture kholinar, the shanay-im oversee the construction of a line of twenty large spires in the city. the columns are narrow pillars of stone that are about one hundred feet tall. they each have a guardhouse at the bottom that controls access to a wooden staircase that winds up the pillar. the design of the spires is reminiscent of an ancient stone pillar in narak; they look precariously balanced, yet they are able to survive highstorms. at the top of each spire is a room known as a high chamber that is open on two sides and has no railings at the edge. these chambers serve as living quarters for the most important of the shanay-im; their voices typically live in the guardhouse. they have other servants that attend to them, including a stormsetter that is charged with packing up the shanay-im's possessions before each storm. lesser shanay-im live in conventional housing. notable shanay-im[edit] trivia[edit] - the name shanay-im may derive from the hebrew word ""shamayim"" (שָׁמַיִם) (ipa: ʃəˈmajim or ʃaˈmajim), which means ""heavens"". - . ""-im"" is the hebrew masculine plural suffix, hence the singular would be ""shanay"" and plural ""shanayim"". (the word ""shamayim"" is indeed in the plural, hence the translation ""heaven - "", and ""shanayim"" as ""heavenly ones"") notes[edit]"
Ristina,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ristina,"ristina is an alethi scribe in urithiru. appearance and personality[edit] she is very short. she has a sense of humor, unlike many scribes. history[edit] she was on duty at the narak oathgate on the day that skar and lyn became radiant squires. she used a ledger to note who traveled through the oathgate, and chided a tardy kaladin on behalf of the waiting merchants. when he said to tell them that the knights radiant are not ""their doormen,"" she smirked and wrote something down, as if to tell the merchants exactly that. skar liked her sense of humor, and the two later started dating. because kaladin liked intelligent women and did not care about height, adolin thought ristina could have been a good match for him had she not been with skar. trivia[edit] - skar is a cameo for brandon's friend - , and ristina may be a cameo for his wife kristina. notes[edit]"
Cobalt Guard,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cobalt_Guard,"the cobalt guard was the honor guard of house kholin in alethkar on roshar. members of house kholin were highprince dalinar kholin and his sons adolin kholin and renarin kholin. ""“we are the cobalt guard ... our duty is to protect brightlord adolin. ”-captainlord malan of the cobalt guard to kaladin "" history[edit] post: battle of the tower[edit] after the betrayal at the battle of the tower, the cobalt guard was nearly wiped out. after bolstering their numbers with the members of bridge 4, dalinar augmented the king's guard with the remaining men of the cobalt guard to secure king elhokar's life. dalinar took the men from bridge four as his new bodyguards. he gave his cloak to kaladin to show that he was the new head of his personal guard. the remaining members of the cobalt guard accepted kaladin as their leader without a word of complaint. shortly after kaladin becoming captain of the cobalt guard, a few remaining original members, all darkeyed, had started eating meals with bridge four and requested to have the new bridge four patches, but were ordered to keep their original patches on at least one shoulder, as a mark of pride. even with the added numbers from the leftover members of the original cobalt guard, kaladin felt as if he did not have enough men to adequately guard the members of the kholin family. battle in emul[edit] the cobalt guard defended dalinar during the battle in emul. this group, along with cord fended off an attack from nale and the skybreakers. they were later used to create a perimeter around dalinar's tent after the duel between jasnah and ruthar. notable members[edit] - head of cobalt guard (former) - head of cobalt guard (former) - head of cobalt guard (current) - - (former) notes[edit]"
Blackcaps,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Blackcaps,"""“yes, we let darkeyes in. but not runts. ”-blackcaps to skar"" the blackcaps are the personal guard of highprince aladar on roshar during the era of solitude. the blackcaps wear a black uniform and helm when they are on duty. they are an elite force, and while they allow darkeyes to join, they are still very selective with their membership. skar tried to join the blackcaps when he came to the shattered plains. due to skar's stature, the blackcaps turned him down, although they claimed they would reconsider if skar managed to find himself some weapons and armor. skar stole the required equipment from the blackcap quartermaster, believing that they would see his theft as a sign of his enthusiasm and cleverness. however, the blackcaps instead branded skar a slave and he was later sold to highprince torol sadeas and made a bridgeman. it is likely that the blackcaps accompanied highprince aladar on dalinar kholin's expedition to center of the shattered plains and participated in the battle of narak. after the start of the true desolation, the blackcaps took turns with other groups of soldiers going on plateau runs to collect gemhearts from chasmfiends. notes[edit]"
Eranniv,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Eranniv,"eranniv is a former shardbearer on the shattered plains. he is first mentioned to adolin by jakamav, who describes him as being boastful and insisting that his skill is higher than his ranking would show, and that he would accept an offer which others refuse in order to stand out. despite this jakamav still warns adolin that he is actually skilled and not completely full of himself, so he should watch out when dueling him. he duels with adolin kholin. notes[edit]"
Chull,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Chull,"the chull is a species of crustacean useful for labor intensive jobs. there are differing breeds of chulls and they come in a variety of shapes and sizes. they are found all across roshar. appearance and anatomy[edit] chulls are massive crustaceans with thick legs with large claws and a stone-like shell. their carapaces are typically red. chulls have whip-like antennae that grow in pace with their shell as they age, so that the chull can sense out spaces to determine if they're large enough to pass through, and beady fist-size black eyes. chull shells are a light, porous stone created from minerals the chull consumes in its food and water and then excretes. since the shell is not alive, chulls are not hurt when their shells are cracked or shaped. in the wild, there are often plants growing in the crevices of a chull's shell. chulls pull their legs and head into their shell when they sleep, and as a result sleeping chulls look like large boulders or small hills. the reshi, and likely others, paint their chulls' shells. one can identify what island a reshi chull handler is from by the colors and patterns on their chulls' shells. behavior[edit] chulls are generally docile creatures. they have claws that are said to be strong enough to break a man's arm, but it is very unusual for them to behave aggressively. they tend to move with a slow, lumbering gait and are generally slower than humans. they are capable of making a wide range of noises, including a gravelly bleating, trumpeting, and snorting. chulls are omnivorous creatures. they eat everything from rockbuds to slugs to smaller crustaceans. domestic chulls are often fed grain. chulls are considered less intelligent than horses and in some cases, stubborn. chulls breed by way of laying eggs. training[edit] there are several different methods of training chull. - in the rural areas of - , chulls are harnessed and controlled with complex leather bridles. - in the coastal region around - , chull drivers often sit directly on the chull's shell and direct them by tapping on their antennae with long poles. - some chulls are trained to respond to different rhythms tapped out on their shells with a guiding reed. these reeds are often as long as a person is tall and allow the driver to drive from the wagon or cart rather than riding on the chull itself. use[edit] chull are highly valued as work animals and are considered to be worth more than the average slave. some people maintain chull herds and rent their labor out on a contract basis.they are slow but strong and are used to pull everything up to and including the large complex bridges dalinar uses for chasm crossings. since their shells can be carved without harming the animal, some people sand flat places on top of a chull to ride and many carts are hooked to fittings drilled directly into their shells. shelves and racks can also be carved into or attached directly to chull shells. since it is lightweight and durable, chull shell is used as a crafting material. shallan had a havah with chull-shell buttons. chull meat is edible. it can be dried and stored as jerky. in some cultures, including herdazian and unkalaki, chull head is considered a delicacy. dalinar kholin uses them to pull his bridges, rather than put the lives of bridgemen at risk. cultural references[edit] there is a tavern in dalinar's warcamp called the ""ornery chull."" idioms[edit] ""“you think i'm scared of a lumbering chull like you? ”-teft's nervous retort."" ""“jasnah is inordinately fond of dust, i believe she thrives on it, feeding off the particles like a chull crunching rockbuds. ”-shallan davar talking with kabsal"" ""“an army was like a massive chull at times, lumbering along, slow to react ”-dalinar regarding his army.""

Yezriar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Yezriar,"brightlord yezriar is a crown prince of one of the alethi princedoms on roshar. he was killed by dalinar early in gavilar's unification war. appearance and personality[edit] yezriar is a high-ranking lighteyes. in battle, he wears steel plate armor with a helm and cape that is styled to resemble shardplate. he rides a white mare and carries a sword and shield. he is accompanied by an honor guard on the battlefield, and he seems to follow established military traditions and customs. history[edit] in 1140, gavilar invaded one of the alethi princedoms that opposed his ambition to rule alethkar. gavilar's forces, led by dalinar, pursued the local army from the south somewhere in the outskirts of the princedom. during the pursuit, the locals set their own land on fire, desperately hoping to slow gavilar's attack. however, dalinar pressed his forces through the fires and caught up to a portion of the defending army, led by yezriar. yezriar's army included an archer with a blue face tattoo, presumably teleb. dalinar wanted to kill the most important person he could find. he knew that the highprince was fighting further north, but he vaguely recalled gavilar mentioning a son. torol sadeas later mentioned the crown prince being a strategic threat. dalinar's soldiers quickly began to route yezriar's defenses and yezriar accepted dalinar's challenge for a personal duel. jenin shot yezriar's horse with an arrow; yezriar fell, but quickly recovered to face dalinar. dalinar attacked aggressively, but one of his shield straps broke during the fight, allowing yezriar a brief opportunity that he took advantage of to land several blows on dalinar, including a gauntleted punch directly to his face. however, this further stirred the thrill in dalinar, who ferociously attacked with a poleaxe. yezriar attempted to flee, but dalinar tripped him and slammed the poleaxe through his chest. as he lay dying, yezriar asked dalinar why he had attacked their princedom, and was surprised to hear that dalinar did not know and had simply followed gavilar's orders. dalinar had dym end yezriar's suffering by stabbing him with a sword through a gap in his armor. dalinar later told teleb that he killed yezriar in lieu of capturing him in order to discourage other lighteyes from resisting gavilar's rule. yezriar's father was also killed in the fighting, and his head was placed on a spear. many years later, yezriar's death was among the memories that odium rekindled in dalinar's mind to help demonstrate how much he had influenced dalinar's life through the thrill. dalinar thought of yezriar as a better man than himself. notes[edit]"

""maps"" is a nickname that comes from a birthmark on his chest that he swears is an exact map of alethkar, although kaladin does not see the resemblance. his real name is unknown. history[edit] maps was among the members of bridge four that kaladin met in his early days as a bridgeman. he was not one of the first to accept kaladin's leadership. however, he was drawn to camaraderie and soon became one of kaladin's supporters. after kaladin's judgement in the highstorm, maps gave a brief speech addressing bridge four. he expressed support for kaladin and presented rock with his razor; the other bridgemen appreciated him speaking up. however, he was skeptical when kaladin later brought up the idea of an escape attempt. maps continued to become more relaxed and friendly around the group, and encouraged others to talk. he was among the bridgemen that figured out that sigzil was a worldsinger, and asked him to tell the men a tale while they were on chasm duty, much to sigzil's chagrin. he died during the fifth battle in which dalinar and torol sadeas cooperated, taking a parshendi arrow through the lung and into his spine. kaladin attempted to perform emergency surgery, but was unable to save him. he was one of the people that kaladin thought about before swearing the second ideal of the windrunners. notes[edit]"

Austrism,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Austrism,"austrism is a monotheistic religion centered around a god named austre, practiced by the idrian people on nalthis. austre is often called ""god of colors"". austre is not endowment, and his true identity (if any) is unknown. before the manywar and the exile of the royal family, he was also worshipped in hallandren. teachings[edit] according to the doctrine of austrism, austre commands the returned to come back to life, and gives breath to humanity. the fundamental tenets of the religion are called the five visions. these are the visions had by vo, the first returned, before he died. ""“i saw men who placed themselves above others, and i saw them cast down. ”-a quote from one of vo's five visions"" the visions teach the virtues of humility, sacrifice and seeing another's problems before your own. they teach that no person should try to put oneself above others, and that austre regards all people equally. acting ostentatiously, rejecting people because of their sins, and flaunting one's talents are seen as sins. austrism also teaches that there is nothing wrong with feelings, but drawing attention to yourself with them is wrong. austrism, as practiced by idrians, considers breaths to be intimately linked to human souls. for that reason followers of austre consider holding the breaths of others to be a sin, and using them to awaken to be an even greater sin. however, vasher states that such intolerance toward awakening only emerged after the manywar. preventing pregnancies is seen as a sin. austre[edit] ""“he’s more of a force. you know, the thing that watches over all people, who punishes those who don’t do what is right and who blesses those who are worthy. ”-siri explaining the concept of austre to susebron"" austre is the only god of the monotheistic religion of austrism. he is often referred to as the ""god of colors."" austre is not endowment; it is unknown if he is a real being or not. while male pronouns are used to reference austre, he is not seen as a person, but instead, as an invisible karmic force that watches over all people. despite being viewed as a force, he is often given human descriptions, such as colorful eyes. he is said to have emotion and to be able to be pleased or displeased with someone's actions. followers of austrism believe he regards all humans, regardless of their societal status, as equals. he is believed to make all living things, and to put them in their proper place better than any human could. he is also said to give people their personalities and their talents. austrism holds that he sends the returned back to nalthis as his prophets, and gave vo the five visions. the idrians believe that austre watches over them and protects them. they call themselves sons and daughters of austre. members of austrism[edit] curses[edit] almost every idrian uses austre's name for a variety of expressions of confusion, shock, and disbelief. ""for austre’s sake!"" ""austre, god of colors!"" ""what in austre’s name was that?"" ""oh, austre."" ""oh, god, lord of colors!"" monks[edit] monks of austrism (also called idrian monks) are supposed to be the most pious and least ostentatious of idrians. they are required to shear off their hair and wear white robes. it is seen as a duty in idris to provide at least one child for the monasteries (especially among noble or rich families), as it is against the five visions to be selfish, even with one's own blood. idrian monks do not get locked in a monastery--they can leave at any time--and they provide services for the needy in idris. the monks act as servants to the kingdom's poor in a very formalized way. for example, if a man breaks his leg and can't work, a monk will take his place at his job; the wages earned will still go to the injured man's family. occasionally, if a father dies, a monk is permanently assigned to his place at work and provides for that man's family. monks are forbidden to own or possess anything themselves and give everything they have to the people. without the pressure to feed themselves or acquire goods, some monks can be a little lazy. however, many are very diligent, such as fafen. quotes[edit] ""“flowers ain't evil, assuming they're left where austre put them. we shouldn't use austre's beauty to make ourselves more important. ”-mab to siri "" ""“in the distance, she could see the plateau that held the court of gods, the most profane place beneath austre's colorful eyes. ”-vivenna travelling in t'telir "" trivia[edit] austre may be a very old returned. notes[edit]"
BioChromatic Breath,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Drab,"biochromatic breath, also known simply as breath, is the common form of investiture on nalthis. biochroma[edit] every nalthian is born with one breath, though a person may choose to transfer that breath to another person. it is possible for children of nalthian parents with breath born away from nalthis to have their own breath. when a person dies, the breath they were carrying returns to endowment and leaves with their soul. humans are able to use their breath to perform awakening as well as gaining benefits from having one or more breaths. breaths vary in strength, and tend to weaken when the person is sick. the fluctuation of strength for a breath is normally not very noticeable, particularly when someone has many breaths. the more breaths a person has, the more they will heighten colors around them and the further their area of effect is. it is possible to hide this effect. having enough breath will interact strangely with color-blindness and synesthesia. when a person dies, they may have their breath pulse, sending out a wave of heightened color. this flare of brightness during death is rare. a person may also be able to forcefully flare color around them. breath, through an unknown method, can have memories encoded into it. excising the breaths in which memory is stored will lead to the loss of said memories. breaths are not inherently connected to nalthis since they are freely given gifts, thus they do not limit worldhopping. awakening[edit] awakening is the process by which an awakener uses their stored biochromatic breath to animate an object. to do so, they issue a command in their native tongue while visualizing the action they want the object to complete. the commands are the key part of awakening, and the skill of an awakener depends on their ability to use commands correctly. the process causes some portion of the awakener's stored breath to exit their body and become invested in the awakened object. depending on the object, it may require any where from one to one thousand (or more) breaths. furthermore, color is drained from nearby objects as fuel for the awakening process. this can manifest, for example, as a red scarf being bleached grey. though the color drain is permanent, this magic is still considered end-neutral since the breaths can be recovered from the awakened object (in most cases). while anyone can benefit from possessing a breath, a non-nalthian possessor would 'probably have to jump through some hoops to awaken' with it. it is impossible to reabsorb breaths from an object awakened by somebody else, unless they blank their identity first with intent. this is likely due to the imprint of the awakener's soul being left in the breath that awakens the object, since breath is a part of one's soul. types of biochromatic entities[edit] vasher categorizes biochromatic entities into four types. at some point vasher had to change the system. he refers to spren as type one invested entities and describes them as power that came alive on its own. he adds that what he used to consider type i are now considered type ii. it's not clear if other adjustments are made to his system. type i[edit] spontaneous sentient biochromatic manifestations in a deceased host, also known as the returned, are the only known natural biochromatic entity. they retain sentience after being returned (by endowment) following death, and are endowed with a divine breath. returned are able to awaken normally using any breaths on top of their divine breath, but giving away the divine breath results in death. the divine breath, a single powerful breath that grants the powers of the first five heightenings, is a splinter of endowment. giving away the divine breath to another person will instantly heal that person, at the cost of the life of the returned. divine breaths cannot be transferred like normal breaths as they immediately become kinetic investiture when used. type ii[edit] type ii biochromatic entities are mindless manifestations in a deceased host, or more commonly known as ""lifeless"", and are non-sentient reanimated animal remains. they have a functioning brain, and are able to interpret old commands and have new commands given. these creatures are made via complex commands that reanimate a dead person or animal. these commands are guarded closely by those who know them. type ii entities are cheap to make, even with awkward commands (used to cost 50 breaths before the manywar). this is due to the law of biochromatic parallelism. however, breath sticks so firmly to the construct that it is impossible to remove afterwards. once a lifeless is created, it will obey any instructions given to it that include a pre-determined command phrase(similar to a password). human lifeless are able to understand more abstract instructions than animal lifeless. however, the skill of the awakener who awakens the lifeless also affects its ability. any lifeless will retain a level of skill that it had in life. for example, a soldier's corpse would make a better soldier lifeless than that of a farmer's. the lifeless can function for a long time if cared for and repaired. lifeless can withstand otherwise mortal wounds, but too much damage will eventually cause the lifeless to cease activity, which means that lifeless bodies need to be maintained and repaired (e.g. by sewing its wounds shut) when needed, otherwise they are going to need a new breath. one innovation in lifeless maintenance is the use of ichor-alcohol, a substance discovered by yesteel that could act as blood for lifeless and that greatly prolongs their viability. lifeless created from bones encased in stone have the advantage of being extremely resilient and not needing ichor-alcohol. it is also possible to make stone lifeless by transforming a dead body to stone (e.g. via soulcasting) before awakening it. the discovery of how to create lifeless with just a single breath eventually led to the lifeless armies of the manywar. one example of a single-breath lifeless command is, ""awaken to my breath, serve my needs, live at my command and my word"". type iii[edit] the process generally thought of as awakening creates type iii entities, a biochromatic manifestation in an organic host far removed from being alive. examples include awakened ropes, cloth, or skeletal remains. they are between the two extremes of inorganic objects and dead bodies. therefore, these have the advantage of requiring less breath (still more than corpses, often over one hundred) to awaken than inorganic objects while at the same time allowing for breath recovery. they have the strength to easily strangle people. the more it resembled living beings, the easier it is to be awakened, so a skilled awakener would prepare human-shaped and organic clothes for awakening purposes. when awakened, it tends to mimic living things, forming muscle-like structures or the shape of hands. they are understandably the most common type of biochromatic host entities created. however, other types of biochromatic hosts are generally more powerful. type iv[edit] type iv biochromatic entities are sentient objects made by awakening inorganic materials like metal and stone. this requires at least the ninth heightening. nightblood, a sentient awakened sword, is an example of this type of entity. he was created by shashara with the help of her husband talaxin, also known as vasher, using a thousand breaths and the command ""destroy evil"". nightblood is incapable of determining morality and has a rigid way of thinking similar to a spren on roshar. the large number of breaths he contains also grants him incredible destructive power. the threat of more weapons like nightblood being created eventually caused talaxin to kill shashara to prevent the knowledge of this form of awakening from becoming public. stone is presumed to be similarly difficult to awaken. however, lifeless can be made by enclosing bones in stone, making near-indestructible warriors. talaxin used this technique to create the legendary kalad's phantoms. vivenna's blade might also be a type iv entity, though it has not been confirmed. biochromatic laws[edit] law of biochromatic parallelism[edit] the closer a host is to a living shape and form, the easier it is to awaken. this is easily understood since biochroma is the power of life, and seeks patterns of life. law of comparability[edit] the amount of breath required to awaken something isn't necessarily indicative of its power once awakened. a good example is that a piece of cloth cut into a square and a piece of cloth cut into the shape of a man take very different amounts of breath to awaken, but will serve essentially the same function once awakened. collecting breath[edit] in order to achieve the most interesting and extravagant awakening, more than one breath is required. since each person is born with a single breath, an awakener must collect breaths from other individuals. the method by which this is done is itself a type of awakening, using the command ""my life to yours, my breath become yours."" the person imparting the breaths must be in physical contact with the recipient. as a person gains more breaths, they are granted certain properties. these heightenings, as they are known, are markers along a continuous scale of breath. as a person gains more breath, they are more resistant to disease (for example), but at approximately 2,000 breaths this reaches a maximum and they are immune to most diseases. if a person was sick before receiving a large amount of breaths, they will quickly be cured. the number of breaths for each heightening are approximate. depending on the quality of breath, it may take fewer breaths to realize a heightening. furthermore, very little is known about the upper heightenings (above the sixth). very few individuals amass such a store of breath. if a person gains a large amount of breaths at once, they will feel a sudden burst of pleasure and shock. this typically causes people to collapse to the ground, quivering. this will not occur if the person recently had a large amount of breaths. if enough breaths are collected, they can start to affect the personality of the person holding them. ""breaths do bring some things along with them,"" but they are not ""terribly individual"" depending on their original owner. for example, vahr's resolve was strengthened because of the similar mindsets of those he collected his breaths from, but the effect only manifested due to the large amount of breaths he had. heightenings[edit] drab[edit] drab is the colloquial name for anyone in hallandren without a biochromatic breath. terms such as dull or faded one are also used. without breath, colors lose their vibrancy and their other senses are dulled. contrary to what many people believe in hallandren, being without a breath has significant negative effects. they feel less emotion and are more susceptible to depression. a person's allure decreases, as does the strength of their immune system. the latter stems from the fact that breath acts as a sort of magical booster for the body, and thus the body doesn't need to build up immunity. due to these facts, they typically have a shorter lifespan. drabs lack life sense (the instinctive feeling to know if someone is watching them) and do not register on the life sense of others. a drab is also incapable of returning. many people sell their breaths when they are short of cash, then spend their time trying to earn enough money to buy back a breath. however, some people who gave their breath to a returned out of their beliefs cherish their status as a drab. if someone is made into a lifeless before endowment returned that person, endowment's gift of a divine breath would come down, strike the lifeless, and 'all kinds of craziness' would occur. they would end up as a 'drab god'. breath equivalent units[edit] the breath equivalent unit (beu) is a unit of measurement for investiture based on biochromatic breath. even on highly invested worlds, a person’s soul typically isn’t more than three beus. a normal threnodite from canticle has only one beu. a sunheart made from a threnodite on canticle contains about two hundred beus. trivia[edit] - breath is specifically named biochromatic breath due to some of the - having visited other more advanced worlds that had a more scientific approach to the study of investiture. - a person from another - in the cosmere would have more innate investiture than a drab, but less than someone with one breath. notes[edit]"
Court of Gods,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Court_of_Gods,"""“they hold every single pass to the northern kingdoms! every workable copper mine! they have military garrisons within striking distance of t’telir! and they still claim to be ruled by the rightful kings of hallandren! ”-blushweaver's priestess to the court of gods"" the court of gods is the home and parliament of the returned in hallandren. while the returned effectively rule the nation, they are confined inside the walls of this complex in t'telir, the capital of hallandren. appearance[edit] god king’s palace[edit] the palace of the god king is located at the far side of the court of gods, directly opposite to the court’s gates. it is large, far larger then the other palaces and is pyramidal in shape. the palace is made of large blocks, approximately 10 feet high. the first few levels are formed of square blocks, though the rest of the levels are steeper and closer to a traditional fortress. the palace has four floors, and the fourth floor has a stairway to the flat palace roof. the outer walls of the palace are adorned with decorations. because the god king represents all colors, the rooms where the god king stays are each coloured differently. the stone walls are still black however, so coloring is achieved by filling the room with silks and tiles of a specific color. the palace is divided into two area’s, the inner part, where the god king resides, in this area the rooms are all coloured,and the outer part, this is the servants area, inside this area the rooms are all black. some rooms have windows to the outside. most rooms in the palace don’t have a dedicated purpose, instead the servants bring in furniture when it is needed. because of this most things in the palace are portable, like for example bathtubs. an exception to this is the conception chamber, this room technically lies in the servants part of the palace, with a window to the outside, from which a person can see the sea. the room has a large imposing door, which is completely plated with gold. the hallway in front of the door has four lamps without coloured glass. there are lots of storage rooms in the palace. there is also a large library. the god kings palace is attached to the tunnel complex beneath the court. there is always food available, so that when the god king asks for it, he doesn’t have to wait. the palace was first created by the shipmates of vo, as a residence for their queen. before the manywar the fortress was stark, built with odd twists and turns to confuse an invading foe. after the manywar, while the stonework remained the same, the open dining halls or garrison rooms were split into many, smaller rooms, colorfully decorated in the mode of the hallandren upper class. returned palaces[edit] additionally all the returned have their own palace in the court. these palaces are arranged in a ring. while the palaces are the same color as the returned who inhabits it, they are painted with many different hues, only visible for someone of the third heightening. the palaces have two stories, although the second story is little more then a roof, with no walls. the palaces contain dozens of rooms. these rooms are filled with the finest decorations imaginable. while the palaces do have hallways, these are for the servants. at the center of a palace is a small room, in this room the residing returned feasts on the breath of a child. ""“each red was different, like notes on a musical scale. the walls were of pure red. the roof tiles, side columns, and other ornamentations were of slightly different shades, each distinct and intentional. the columns, for instance, formed stepping fifths of color, harmonizing with the base tint of the walls.”-vivenna describing a returned palace"" another room is the offering room, this room is long and thin and is completely white, something very unusual in hallandren. this room is used to show the offerings which were made to a returned, these will in turn rate the paintings. petitions are heard in the petition hall, this room is often open to the outside and contains a throne for the residing returned. all the palaces are lit by torches and lanterns with the same colours as their gods. most palaces are connected to the large tunnel complex beneath the court. due to hallandren’s climate the palaces don’t have actual walls, and are separated by little more then cloth. the returned do employ guards, however these aren’t meant to actually protect the palaces, and are unarmed. the guards instead prevent people from entering the palaces without a reason. arena[edit] just outside of the ring of palaces, at the back of the court, is an arena. this arena has a circular shape and is very ornate, although not to large. the arena lacks a roof and its floor is made out of sand. there are four rows of benches for the common people to sit on, while the gods enjoy clefts carved into the building. these boxes are located at the tops of the arena, so everyone have to look up at them, they also have holes in them for the canopy of a god. the god king also has a box, and on top of this box is a golden throne. this box is located at the very top of the arena. the arena has a stone pathway running in a circle around it. the arena is a source of entertainment for the returned, but the priests debate here as well, informing the returned about the current political situation. a lot of the larger events are held here. it also allows the common people to see the returned. the floor of the arena can be furnished as needed, in the case of a debate for example a number of pedestals would be put down. the court’s arena is often used as a location for athletic individuals to engage in contests of physical prowess. some arena competitions mentioned are shot put, javelin toss, archery, leaping contests, and races. the returned often watch these events. common people can enter the arena through a couple of different ways. they can simply buy their way in, or possess enough breath to be let in without issue. they can also win a lottery and be allowed into the court. gardens and walls[edit] the court is essentially a giant lawn. there are no true gardens in the court, however the returned may summon gardeners, these then bring out many different types of plants, going so far as to create temporary flower beds. the court of gods has a wall running around it, although just behind the gate there is a second wall to stop people from looking into the court. this second wall doesn’t fully run around the court. the walls are hung by large tapestries, these tapestries are replaced often enough to not have a single scratch. these walls are protected by human soldiers. common people can enter the court through a couple of different ways. they can simply buy their way in, or possess enough breath to be let in without issue. they can also win a lottery and be allowed into the court. near the gates are a number of shelters where people can stay for the night. lifeless enclave[edit] the lifeless barracks are located at the bottom of the court. the building is gigantic and has a covered walkway leading to it. there are multiple guard posts on the walkway from the court to the enclave. this walkway also contains several twisting passages, designed to confuse and disorganise enemies trying to strike at the lifeless. the lifeless are kept in the dark. the compound is made up of four warehouse like storage areas for the different groups of lifeless there is also a track for them to run around and a room with various stones and blocks of metal for them to lift. there is also a medical area where their [[ichor-alcohol is tested and refreshed. there is also a viewing platform, allowing a person to get a good overview of the lifeless. the barracks are connected to the large tunnel complex underneath the court. functions[edit] politics[edit] the court of gods is the political heart of hallandren. the returned, who make the decisions, reside here. the returned aren’t allowed to leave the court however, so the priests convey the will of the common people through debates in the large arena. as part of the government, each returned is assigned specific administrative duties, such as maintaining the city sewers or commanding part of the army. the god king can nominally make any decision he pleases, but in reality much of the day-to-day government decisions are made by the priests of the various gods. the court assembly is a standing commission of the court of gods that provides decisions to hallandren's citizens. it meets daily to make small judgments. the assembly is made up primarily of priests and priestesses. the returned do not sit on the assembly, but many of them regularly attend the weekly meetings to watch. during assembly meetings, arguments are brought forth regarding various topics. the assembly's discussions are often full of rhetoric and politically savvy returned try to influence the direction of the assembly. the regular court assembly is not empowered to make major decisions such as a declaration of war; instead, all of the returned must attend a gathering known as a ""main"" or ""general"" assembly so they can all cast a vote. bluefingers is the head scribe and keeps the court running. religious[edit] the court of gods exists to protect and nurture the returned. the hallandren believe that the returned come back to help the people, and therefore keep them alive. the returned have at least somewhat prophetic dreams, and this is one of the reasons the returned are so valuable, hallandren priests write them down each morning. another reason is because of their goal, all returned come back to achieve something. the petitions are used to help gods remember what they returned for, although some gods do actually help the people. the hallandren send offerings to one of the gods when they need something, an attribute like courage or boldness. these offerings are often paintings or other works of art. it is the work of the priests to record what the gods say and think of these paintings. furthermore, the priests need to arrange breaths so that their gods can continue to live and bless humanity. staff[edit] priesthood[edit] the court is the religious center of hallandren, therefore it has a large amount of priests, while these priests have religious responsibilities they also rule the empire in the name of their king. priests wear intricate robes and some priests, likely the more important ones, wear miters. it seems the more important one is the more intricate ones robe and miter become. the robes of the priests are the colors of their god, with the god king’s priests wearing different colours everyday the main job of the priests is to care for the returned. this includes making sure that the returned have enough food and drinks to enjoy, dressing then etc. the more important priests have jobs like writing down the dreams of a returned or writing down their review. each high priest also argues in the arena in order to keep the gods informed of the common people’s opinions. there seems to be a clear ranking system in the priesthood, at the top is the high priest of the god king below him or her are probably the high priests of the returned. priests aren’t paid for their services. servants[edit] there are two kinds of servants in the court of gods. the first type are the hallandren servants. the god king’s servants are all hallandren, these servants are dressed in different colors each day, likely because the god king represents all colors. servants are responsible for many things, from opening doors to delivering food and washing the god king and queen. it seems the returned also employ hallandren servants, these servants dress in the colours of their god and seem to have much of the same jobs. the servants duty is to be as efficient as possible without being distracting, therefore they rarely speak while working. the second type are the pahn kahl servants. these servants are considered second class by most. they aren’t allowed to serve the god king, and most of them have worse jobs then the hallandren. the pahn kahl servants have to wear brown. havarseth manages all servants in the court. soldiers and awakeners[edit] both of the walls are patrolled by soldiers. the returned palaces are also guarded by soldiers, though these do not have weapons. the priests have access to many lifeless some of the priests are awakeners and there are some very skilled awakeners among them. history[edit] the god kings[edit] after peacegiver stopped the war he gave his breaths to a priest in t’telir, this priest would go on and become the first god king. with the royals driven out, the cult of the returned took over and the court of gods was formed. four more children would become god kings, all of them would be called susebron. susebron the third died giving away his breath to save the children in a raided village while susebron the fourth died to heal a plague of distrentia. eventually susebron the fifth returned and became king. treaty with idris[edit] the court of gods formed a treaty with idris in approximately the year 307, in which was written that king dedelin of idris would send his daughter to be married to susebron the fifth, the god king of hallandren. this treaty would further legitimize the court’s claim to rule in hallandren, as an heir would have the royal blood and presumably royal locks (something the people of hallandren desired). rebellion[edit] in the year 327, the court of gods was challenged by the pahn kahl rebellion. the people of hallandren were mad at the gods, who had become complacent and apathetic towards the needs of the people. it had been 3 years since a god had sacrificed their divine breath to heal someone. this rebellion was supported by idris via their spy lemex, along with several slumlords. the rebellion was quelled when bluefingers informed the court of vahr's location, after which he was captured and tortured in one of their dungeons. he was kept alive as the court desired his breath. his capture and eventual death at the hands of vasher effectively ended the rebellion. a new queen[edit] around this time, dedelin decided to send his youngest daughter, siri, instead of his oldest daughter vivenna, as the treaty had not stipulated which daughter would be married to susebron. this agitated the court, spurring more talk of war. had idris sent nobody, it would have meant all out war. the argument against the war was the lands held by the idrians was undesirable and cold. the main argument for the war was to claim and protect the trade routes, as being cut off from them would lead to full economic collapse in t'telir. siri's arrival started the wedding jubilation within the court, which was a weeklong celebration. this marked the first time they'd had a queen in thirty years. members[edit] the court holds around two dozen gods, including the god king. the court assembly has room for around fifty gods. various past members of the court of gods are known. notes[edit]"
Tedradel,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tedradel,"tedradel is a kingdom on nalthis that has existed from before the time of the manywar. it is located across the bright sea from hallandren. history[edit] tedradel opposed hallandren in the manywar, possibly as part of the pahn unity. when vasher withdrew kalad's phantoms, it was brought out of the conflict along with the rest of the surviving kingdoms. however, since the manywar, tedradel's hatred and animosity towards hallandren has not lessened greatly. tedradel was on good enough terms with idris that it was considered possible by general yarda that tedradel would come to their aid if a conflict erupted between idris and hallandren. culture[edit] the people of tedradel have brown skin, and traders from there often wear long black beards tied into a cylindrical shape with a leather cord. tedradel is still on good enough relations with hallandren by the time of the pahn kahl rebellion that it had traders in t'telir. vivenna wears a dress in a fashion from tedradel that is tube-like and tightly fitted. it is a long dress, going from her ankle almost to her neck, with full-length sleeves. it is possible that they also export fine pottery, as some is to be found in hallandren that comes from across the bright sea, where tedradel was located. notes[edit]"

Idris,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Idris,"""“composed, simple, hard, and capable. idrian. ”-king dedelin's observation of vivenna"" idris is a country to the north of hallandren on nalthis. geography and ecology[edit] ""“they’re rocks, like you said, but they’re not lifeless. they’re green-as green as your jungles. but it’s a different green. ”-siri telling susebron about the mountains of her homeland"" idris lies in the highlands, where its location allows control over the four main trade passes to the north. the land in idris is rich with minerals that also bring the country wealth. the countryside has vegetation that buds out in spring, though it only gets warm for a brief period each year; some valuable roots grow higher up in the mountains. there are fields and meadows with grasses and wild flowers. the air is crisp and chilly due to the elevation. history[edit] ""“the royal family of idris, who can apparently trace their line back to the first returned. another heritage of divinity, a challenger for rightful rule in hallandren. ”-siri musing on the politics surrounding the throne of hallandren"" idris was one nation with hallandren until the manywar, when the royals refused to support the conflicts that led up to the war. the separate nation of idris was formed at the climax of the war when the royal family fled to the mountains for safety after being rejected by the people of hallandren in favor of being ruled by the returned. twenty years before the events of the pahn kahl rebellion, dedelin's father was assassinated, and he inherited the throne. king dedelin's first official act was to negotiate a treaty with susebron promising to send his daughter (ostensibly vivenna, though this was not stated specifically) to the court of gods to marry him when vivenna turned twenty-two, thereby reintroducing the bloodline of the royals into hallandren's own ruling line. when the time came, however, dedelin could not bring himself to send his beloved daughter to what he was sure would be her death, so he sent siri instead. during that time of deteriorating relations, lemex, the chief idrian spy in t'telir, acted on dedelin's orders in an attempt to destabilize hallandren and undermine its ability to wage war. unfortunately, he was oblivious to the fact that denth and his crew, whom he had hired to aid in his efforts, were manipulating him; lemex's actions were actually inflaming the already considerable tensions. vivenna continued his work, also in the name of helping idris and also unaware of denth's true motivations. at the culmination of the pahn kahl rebellion, hallandren's lifeless army was sent to idris to slaughter its population; however, susebron sent kalad's phantoms after the army, who reached the lifeless in time to defeat the force. politics[edit] idris has a monarchical system of government and is ruled by king dedelin. the eldest child, regardless of gender, inherits the throne. those of the royal family who either rule or are potential heirs have the royal locks: hereditary hair that changes color according to the bearer's emotional state, at their will, or not at all when the bearer uses training and discipline to suppress the changes. those with the royal locks can also grow them when they want to, and this feels to them as if they were using a physical muscle. the royal family in idris usually keeps their hair black or brown, as other colors such as red or yellow are considered ostentatious. ""“your people are in a state of rebellion against the rest of the kingdom.”-treledees to siri"" while idrians consider themselves a separate nation from hallandren, hallandren considers idris to be rebel-controlled land still within its borders. this is the main source of tension between the two nations, a tension that is kept in check during the first twenty years of dedelin's reign by his treaty with susebron that promises to send one of his daughters to the court of gods to marry the god king. according to bebid, dozens of kingdoms north of idris do not share hallandren's belief that idris is a rebel faction, and these countries would ally with idris should a war break out, or use the opportunity to seize control of t'telir. because king dedelin fears war, he establishes lemex as the head of his spy network in t'telir and closely monitors the information lemex sends. idris' armies are harried by vendis raids and are no match in general for the lifeless army of hallandren, and vahr's failed rebellion has renewed hallandren's focus on its enemies. due to these factors, general yarda advises dedelin to do what they must to delay war at least until winter, when heavy snows can be another of their allies; dedelin decides to send siri to fulfill the treaty and stall the process of war for a little longer. in the meantime, yarda discusses riling up the remnants of vahr's rebels and approaching tedradel about gaining their support. culture[edit] the kingdom is drab and relatively devoid of color, reflecting the idrian people's aversion to any display of ""ostentation"" in their way of living. stone walls are whitewashed, and clothing is kept a dull grey or tan in accord with a superstition teaching that this can prevent awakeners from using colors to fuel their magic. idrians consider the hallandren gods to be strange and their religion to be untrue. though ramblemen come through and tell the idrians of the outside world, many idrians hold false ideas of the horrors of hallandren and tell stories of horrible rituals they supposedly carry out there. although the people of idris can also become returned, this is a rare occurrence. the people of idris, unlike those in hallandren, refuse to provide any returned with breath, causing them to die at the end of the week. idrians who convert to the iridescent tones are called 'scrapes' by other idrians. the term is an epithet that refers to a scratch on a person’s arm revealing the colorful blood underneath. ""“women chasing runaway geese, men pulling donkeys laden with spring seed, and children leading sheep on their way to pasture.”-siri describing the people of bevalis"" idris is mostly rural, with most people working as shepherds or farmers. most people believe in austre, and it is a tradition that all families with means enough to spare them should send at least one child to work in the monasteries. these monks dedicate their lives to working for the good of the poor and don't amass possessions or wealth for themselves. the people are taught to be reserved from a young age and ""to avoid shameful outbursts of emotion."" the model idris woman dresses in a way to avoid drawing attention, with hair modestly contained and no makeup; clothing typically covers even the neck. economics[edit] ""“it’s hard, sometimes, living up in those mountains. crops fail, and what do you have? the king owns your land, so you can’t sell... ”-thame explaining to vivenna why thousands of idrians work in hallandren"" idris has few exports of note. the kingdom gains most of its income from tariffs on four main trade passes that it controls. these trade passes are extremely important to hallandren, as they are the kingdom's only reliable method of passage to the north. idris must be careful with the tariffs it charges on goods that pass through these trade routes, as raising them too high would upset the countries that use their routes and could be cause for war. commerce in idris is not particularly robust at the time of the pahn kahl rebellion. due to this, many struggling idrians find themselves traveling south to hallandren for work to support their families. farming is difficult in the snowy mountain range of idris and farmland is owned and levied by the kingdom, not by the farmers themselves. thus, struggling farmers cannot rent or sell land if their crop yield is low, forcing them to find work elsewhere. idris has disaster relief funds, and one can petition the king in the case of disaster. a major flaw with this program is that it requires travel to bevalis, which can take several weeks. thus it is more practical to seek work in hallandren, which is not far from lower farms in southern idris. this is often a better alternative to taking a long trek through snowy mountains, likely with minimal supplies due to the disaster, to petition the king for assistance. bevalis[edit] the capital of idris is the city of bevalis. its roads are unpaved, and its houses are stone-walled, thatched cottages. the royal palace, which serves as a meeting place and a center of operations for the kingdom, is a single-story building with a courtyard of packed dirt; it is, however, large enough to be considered almost ""flamboyant."" bevalis is a small city in comparison with the capitals of other nations on nalthis, with a population of around a few thousand. notable citizens[edit] notes[edit]"
T'Telir,https://coppermind.net/wiki/T%27Telir,"""“it was terribly overwhelming. garish. a vibrant, enthusiastic garishness. ”-siri's first impression of t'telir"" t'telir is the capital city of hallandren on nalthis. it is set on the coast and is known for its blaze of color because of the dyes grown in the area. a person from t'telir is called a t'telirite. geography[edit] the city of t'telir is located somewhere in hallandren, close to idris. t'telir lies in a tropical climate: the temperature is quite warm, colorful animals and flowers are common, and harsh weather is rare. the growth of plants in this region is helped by investiture, much like the elendel basin, this is also the reason that hallandren is the only place in which the tears of edgli grow. the jungle around t’telir is inhabited by panthers, parrots, monkeys, and crocodiles. t'telir is located on the shores of the bright sea. the city is built in a crescent around a bay of the bright sea, abutting the water. the city's placement in this bay, protecting it from storms, makes it a prime port. the area in the direct vicinity of t’telir is covered in jungle. the soil near t’telir is mixed with sand. inside this jungle there are many farms, producing both food and dyes. these farms are owned by people, although in wartime the farms and the products produced on them become state owned. landmarks[edit] the city walls[edit] when entering t’telir one is greeted by its walls. siri describes them as immense and daunting, while almost looking more artistic then functional. the wall’s top is curved in massive half-circles, like rolling hills, and the rim is plated with a golden metal. the gates themselves are described as in the form of two twisting, lithe sea creatures who curve up in a massive archway. the position of the city on the sea means that the city wall only has to run around the landward half-circle of the city. ""“many of the painted buildings did clash, but none of it was sloppy. there was a sense of craftsmanship and art to everything from the storefronts, to the people, to the statues of mighty soldiers that frequently stood on corners.”-siri describing t'telir"" the court of gods[edit] t'telir contains the court of gods, the court is built on a plateau in the south of the city, and entirely walled off. the court consists of a number of palaces for the returned, a large palace for the god king and an arena used for entertainment. the court exists to protect the returned, so that they may bless humanity, and to rule hallandren. t’telir also contains the lifeless enclave, the compound like building containing the entire halllandren army, forty thousand lifeless. this makes t’telir the starting point of any invasion. d'denir celabrin[edit] another notable feature of t'telir lies in the d'denir celabrin, imposing statues of warriors supposedly left as a memorial to those who died in the manywar and as a reminder to the hallandren of the cost of war. the people of t'telir often put colorful clothing on the statues for fun. some statues, particularly those located in the idrian slums, have been defaced or broken. the first ones were left to the city by peacegiver the blessed right after the manywar, though new ones are commissioned yearly by the returned. most of the original statues reside in the d'denir garden, an open grassy field with many statues, this garden is one of the only ones in the city which doesn’t feature flowers and trees and isn’t full of bustling people. the exact location is unknown, but it is somewhere in the north of the city. the garden is noticeably quiet and serene in comparison to the rest of t'telir. despite this, it is a popular place for clandestine meetings after hours. docks[edit] t’telir lies on the shores of the bright sea, and because of it’s location in a sheltered bay, t’telir is a prime port. the t’telirite docks are made up of the shipyards, a number of warehouses and the dock slums. these slums are located between the shipyards and the warehouses. the dockslums are full of dockhands, who live and drink here. stormrunners are ships that go and fish during the spring tempests. stormrunners have a high casualty rate, due to sailing in the spring tempests. t’telir has a number of these stormrunners. everyone who wants to fish in t’telir waters needs to pay a fee. some people avoid this by fishing at night however. there are people at the docks who sew nets. the slumlords of t’telir often dump bodies in the bay, hiring people to go out at night and sink the bodies. markets[edit] t’telir has many markets. like the rest of t’telir the markets are very colourful. most of the markets in t’telir are decorated with the d’denir celabrin. when entering the markets a person is instantly bombarded by the sight, sound, scent, and colours of t’telir. the wealthier shopping districts do not contain merchants raising tents to shade themselves as they sell wares. instead, there are many high quality, colorful shops with more expensive goods. while performers are present in these markets, there are fewer than in the average shopping district. the t’telirite markets are full of merchants from distant kingdoms, such as idris, tedradel and likely the kingdoms beyond the mountains. appearence[edit] colour[edit] t’telir, like the rest of hallandren, is extremely colourful. buildings are painted in a wide array of, often very bright, colours. the same goes for the people, most of whom wear brightly coloured clothing and even dye their hair. even furniture and other objects are painted. due to this there are very few dull things in the city, and most of them are located in the slums, which contain objects and buildings with faded colours. the t'telirites love greenery and as such the city is designed with many gardens and open spaces that show off its greenery and have palm trees and other flora growing along the streets. wealthy areas[edit] the wealthy areas of the city are very diverse, ranging from huge mansions to regular sized houses. these residential areas tend to have less people walking around. since hallandren has no nobility these houses are likely owned by merchants. the flora in these districts is described as being incredibly diverse. dozens of different species of palms, ferns, grasses, and potted flowers, including the tears of edgli, can be found in the gardens of the houses and on the streets. like in most of the city there are many d'denir statues located in these districts. almost none of the roads in the city are made of anything other then dirt, although most roads have slate sidewalks for people to walk upon, and the streets are lined with lanterns. the people tend to stay on the sidewalks because carriages are common. the wealthier shopping districts do not contain merchants raising tents to shade themselves as they sell wares. instead, there are many high quality, colorful shops with more expensive goods. while performers are present in these commercial areas, there are fewer than in the average shopping district. slums[edit] t'telir is home to many slums. while there are different varieties of slums, they generally have a couple characteristics. like the rest of t'telir most of the slums are colourful, even though the colors are a little faded. the slums also contain parks like the rest of the city, although these are very dirty, like the slums themselves. the d’denir statues that decorate much of t'telir are in various states of disrepair in the slums. there are soup kitchens which provide very cheap meals, food being available for only two bits. the best known slum in t'telir is the highlands, the idrian quarter. the highlands are located in the north of the city, and most idrians live here. the highlands are less colourful then the rest of t’telir, although there are still many colors. this slum is ruled by three slumlords, paxen, ashu and rira. furthermore there are many brothels, most only a short distance away from the edge of the highlands. vivenna describes the place as unwelcome. culture[edit] people[edit] there are many different peoples and cultures in t’telir. the most prevalent people are the hallandren. other known cultures in t’telir include pahn kahl and idrian. t’telir has no nobility, instead it has a small but very rich class which is almost completely compromised of the most successful merchants, a middle class, and a large peasant class. hallandren is the only nation on nalthis to have a middle class, instead of only a high and low class. due to this large middle class t’telir has many features that the rest of the world lacks. one of these features is restaurants. restaurants are only possible because of the middle class, which is large, and rich, enough to support businesses. t’telirites often eat lunch at restaurants, as during midday it makes more sense to buy food rather then return all the way home. it is a common practice to wipe your fingers on the tablecloth. lots of enterprising young street boys wander the neighborhoods proclaiming their services, willing to deliver food from restaurants right to people's homes for a fee. the people in t'telir like spicy food, and their food is often centered around seafood, and seasoned with exotic spices. ""“people jostled their way through the streets, draped ﬂagrantly in colors, yelling, and talking, and moving, and stinking, and coughing, and bumping.”-vivenna's first impression of t'telir"" t’telirites like to be together, tending to crowd the same streets. because of the warm climate, they are comfortable with wearing loose, revealing, and few clothes; their clothes are of all kinds of designs, makes, and colors, all meant to make them stand out, though the overwhelming effect is then that no one stands out. the people in the slums are often dirty and beaten down. most slums are ruled by people called slumlords, the crime lords of specific slums in the city. the poor in t'telir take any jobs they can, including prostitution for women and work in the dye fields for men. a lot of people here also beg for money, although this profession isn’t very rewarding in t'telir. there are also underground fighting matches where men can see people, often idrians, box eachother to unconsciousness, these matches are often funded by slumlords. the t’telirites enjoy music, painting, dance, poetry, sculpture, puppetry, play performance, sandpainting and lots of other ‘lesser’ arts. weapons are uncommon enough in the city that a sword draws attention. book ref|wb|19}} timepieces are not common in t’telir, and punctuality is not a high priority in the city, especially among the returned. the t’telirites are fond of carriages, and use them a lot in the city, although the returned and their queen prefer to use palanquins. the t’telirites herd livestock such as sheep and cows. they also enjoy many sorts of sealife, such as mussels, fish, and octopi, and many foreign foods. they like their food spicy. the t’telirites keep their dead in charnel houses. religion[edit] while t’telir is home to many different cultures, and many different religions, the largest part of the population follows the iridescent tones. there are also a number of idrians who follow austrism. as there are many pahn kahl living in the city. the pahn kahl religion is likely practiced as well. t’telir contains the court of gods, a large walled off plateau.this plateau is the home of the returned, including the god king. anyone in the empire who wishes to get a blessing has to send their offerings all the way to t’telir. if people want to petition to the gods they also need to travel all the way to t’telir. both of these things make t’telir very important to the religion. t’telir embodies everything that modern austrism preaches against. for example, austrism preaches that ostentation is forbidden while in t’telir everyone and everything competes for attention. another example is that austrism considers breath to be a part of the soul, while the t’telirites trade in breath. this is likely on purpose as austrism changed significantly after the manywar, hating everything hallandren. during the first three hundred years of the city’s existence the majority of the population followed austrism, although back then it was very different from modern day austrism. during this time the cult of returned likely settled in hanald, although it wasn’t very large yet. after the manywar however the hallandren people felt that austre had forsaken them, and left them to kalad the usurper. partly because of this and partly because of peacegiver stopping the war they started to worship the returned. during this time the cult of returned grew and evolved into the iridescent tones. at the time of the pahn kahl rebellion, people are beginning to doubt their gods more and more, seeing them as less divine, weaker, and less wise. politics and laws[edit] ""“this isn’t about money. it’s about fear. people in the court talk about what might happen if the idrians cut off the passes or what may happen if the idrians let enemies slip through and besiege t’telir. ”-bebid to vasher"" t'telir is the capital of hallandren and contains the court of gods, the home to the returned. hallandren, which includes t’telir, is ruled by the god king, although in reality he has very little political power and is more of a figurehead for his priesthood, who actually rule the empire. the god king has the right to undo any decision made by the court of gods. the returned have duties and votes on specific matters in the city and the empire. the task of the priesthood is generally to inform the gods of the people’s opinions. the returned can then make informed decisions, which the priests enforce. in reality the priests handle most of the minor decisions, so that the returned only vote on the major decisions. this method of government, waiting on debates that must be brought to the gods (who cannot leave the court to be among the people of the city) by the priests, operates much more slowly than idris' monarchy. there are specific laws about where begging is allowed and where it isn’t, these rules aren’t taught to beggars though. hetting into a brawl in the city will get you locked up for a night, although hitting a priest means the death sentence. anyone who wants to fish in the waters of t’telir has to pay a fee. city guard[edit] t’telir has a strong human garrison, although not terribly large. the city guard also contains many lifeless, usually directed by living humans. it is likely that the city guard also contains many of the support staff that goes along with lifeless soldiers. the city guard has a number of cavalrymen. t’telir’s living city guard is dressed in bright yellow and blue, while the lifeless guards are dressed in purple and gold, t’telir is also the location of the entire hallandren lifeless army. this army numbers forty thousand lifeless, fully equipped and ready to respond to any potential invasion. while this army is completely separate of the city guard, it can be called upon to defend the walls. the lifeless soldiers are described as wearing gold and blue, this might be the same as the living human guards, who’s uniforms are described as bright yellow and blue. politics[edit] ""“this isn’t about money. it’s about fear. people in the court talk about what might happen if the idrians cut off the passes or what may happen if the idrians let enemies slip through and besiege t’telir. ”-bebid to vasher"" t'telir is the capital of hallandren and home to the returned. the god king rules t'telir officially and can overrule any decision made by the court of gods, although his priests usually make most decisions for him. the returned are given votes when it comes to big decisions; before casting votes, they listen to their priests debate about the issues in court assemblies. some of the returned also sit on various councils and vote on other important matters in the city. this method of government, waiting on debates that must be brought to the gods (who cannot leave the court to be among the people of the city) by the priests, operates much more slowly than idris' monarchy. the king and the rest of the returned are revered as gods, and those of people who are in trouble, are sick or lame, or need help of some sort, can go to them during their daily time to receive petitions. the poorer people are also entered into a lottery where they can come to court assemblies and view the gods while they make their decisions. however, at the time of the pahn kahl rebellion, people are beginning to doubt their gods more and more, seeing them as less divine, weaker, and less wise. though the general opinion in the city before siri's arrival expected idris to back out on the treaty with susebron, there are still some in the court pushing very vocally for a war with idris, which they consider little better than a rebel enclave within hallandren's borders. history[edit] settling and expansion[edit] the pahn kahl were the original inhabitants of the hallandren lowlands, and of the bay where t'telir was later built. they lived in scattered fishing villages in the valley's jungles. at some point, the people of chedesh discovered the lowlands and multiple ships were sent to investigate. on one of these ships, in the bay of t’telir, a man named vo died, and later returned. after vo died again his crewmates decided to found a kingdom, crowning his wife as queen of hanald. the place where they set foot on land would later become t’telir. the god king's palace was the first building constructed in the city of t'telir. it served as an outpost overlooking the bay and was built by the crew mates of vo, the first returned, three hundred years before the events of the manywar. it would later become the residence of the royal family of hanald, making t’telir the capital. as hanald expanded and its economy grew t’telir grew as well, both in population and in wealth. the increase in wealth happened because of a number of reasons. t’telir is located in a bay, protecting it from storms and making it a prime port. another reason for t’telir’s wealth was, and still is, the farming of many products native to the hallandren lowlands, this includes the tears of edgli which only grow in hallandren due to the present investiture from endowments perpendicularity. this monopoly on the dye trade was a major factor for the manywar, as other kingdoms wished to take control. the manywar[edit] t’telir was home to the royal family of hanald, the descendants of vo. after a returned had a vision of war kalad raised up a large army, and together with the royal family’s own lifeless and awakeners he seized control of hanald, ending three hundred years of reign. at least some of the royal family were kept alive though, and they were stuck in t’telir. near the climax of the manywar the remaining members of the royal family fled t’telir and headed north, establishing the kingdom of idris. after the end of the manywar kalad, then known as peacegiver commanded his phantoms to enter t’telir, and stay put like statues, calling it a gift for the city. eventually the people of t’telir forgot that they were lifeless. modern day hallandren lore holds that peacegiver ""commissioned"" a large number of these statues known as the d'denir celabrin, ostensibly as memorials and reminders not to go to war. the returned continue to build more statues each year throughout the city to honor peacegiver's tradition, although these are not phantoms. the plague[edit] ""“you mean to tell me that our god king-the most holy and divine personage in our pantheon-died to cure a few tummy aches? ”-lightsong"" two hundred and fifty years later, a plague of distrentia struck t'telir. the disease was especially deadly among the elderly and the young, and the nature of it meant that it spread other diseases as well. this caused the city's commerce to slow drastically, meaning that outlying villages went months without necessary supplies. in the end, susebron the fourth gave his breath to cure the plague and susebron the fifth began his rule. the pahn kahl rebellion[edit] thirty years into susebron the fifth's reign, he signed a treaty with king dedelin of idris that promised peace in exchange for his marriage to dedelin's daughter. at the time when the treaty was fulfilled twenty years later, t'telir was the site of the pahn kahl rebellion. first, a pahn kahl named vahr, a worker in the dye fields, made an attempt at stirring up his people. he worked to that end for over a decade but was ultimately captured and imprisoned due to bluefingers' information leaks and killed by vasher. bluefingers himself planned an extensive subversive campaign centered around starting a war between hallandren and idris: he brought mercenaries and pahn kahl awakeners into the tunnel system below the court, manipulated siri into distrusting the hallandren priests, and hired denth's crew to increase tensions in the city. when his plans were nearing completion, he tortured blushweaver and lightsong in order to get the command phrases for hallandren's lifeless army, changed the command phrase, and sent the army towards idris. the attempted rebellion was defeated when susebron, with his newly healed tongue, used peacegiver's treasure to storm his palace with an army of awakened cloths. vasher decided to give him the command phrase to kalad's phantoms, which he then sent after the lifeless army. notable residents[edit] trivia[edit] - brandon wanted to use double consonants as a naming structure in warbreaker, though he also wanted variety in the way in which names were written. thus, we have apostrophes as in t'telir, doubled up letters without an apostrophe as in llarimar, and letters with a vowel in between as in vivenna. notes[edit]"
Blushweaver,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Blushweaver,"""“i will bear the awful burden of being the most wonderful of the gods. ”-blushweaver to lightsong"" blushweaver is a returned from hallandren on nalthis. appearance and personality[edit] ""“i’m the goddess of lust, for your sake. i’ve got to fill the role. ”-blushweaver to lightsong"" blushweaver is considered the epitome of beauty. she has glossy black hair, pale skin, dazzling eyes, red lips, and a lusciously curvaceous body. though mercystar is built more heavily and blushweaver thin, both are considered to have a godly beauty. since returned look the way they believe they should look, blushweaver therefore looks like what she perceives to be the ultimate in honest beauty. her perceived perfection has given her a vain and narcissistic attitude. she expresses disgust for the appearance of ordinary people, jokes that bad fashion sense is worse than murder, and states in jest that attention should always be on her. blushweaver wears little clothing, often appearing in revealing gowns of her colors, green and silver. she is often seen in seductive poses. her personality is centered around seduction, as she propositions lightsong on several occasions and often talk about her personal relationships, with fellow returned and mortals, including her own priests. like most returned, blushweaver has become decadent due to the nature of the court of gods: a group of servants follows her wherever she goes, meeting her every whim. this has made her somewhat lazy and capricious; despite this, she is determined to improve the fate of hallandren and takes her role as a god seriously enough to expend great effort to control the hallandren military in order to preserve hallandren. in no small part due to the length of her rule, she has become ""one of the most dynamic figures in the court."" ""“they hold every single pass to the northern kingdoms! every workable copper mine! they have military garrisons within striking distance of t’telir! and they still claim to be ruled by the rightful kings of hallandren! ”-blushweaver to the court of gods"" blushweaver directly urges lightsong to action. when he suggests that they just allow the universe to take its course, she tells him to ""fight it,"" suggesting that she is not as lost as some of the other gods to boredom and indolence. she is witty and enjoys verbal sparring with him as well. lightsong additionally states that she is unlikely to engage with him without an ulterior motive, as her lengthy fifteen years as a returned has made her incredibly wise and crafty. when blushweaver first returns, she is unhappy with her title of ""the honest."" she considers pursuing a reputation of honor and justice, but decides that a persona as the goddess of love and romance feels more natural to her and will lead to greater power. this is now how she views herself. attributes and abilities[edit] as a returned, blushweaver has a divine breath which gives her the benefits of being on the fifth heightening. this includes: - aura recognition - allows her to assess the number of breaths a person possesses. - perfect pitch - perfect color recognition - allows her to instantly and instinctively determine exact shades of colors and their hue harmonics. - perfect life sense - allows her to sense people around her. - agelessness - makes her immune to most toxins and physical ailments, as well as making her functionally immortal. she is a skilled negotiator and politician, as demonstrated by her ability to convince other returned to place her in control of half of the country's lifeless military forces. her presence on the court of gods as a returned grants her a palace, at least 30 servants, a high priestess, and 6 lesser priests. history[edit] return[edit] before blushweaver's return, she was a very well known and powerful merchant in hallandren. she was assassinated after exposing a group of dye merchants she worked with for their untrustworthy, deceptive, and criminal practices; this was the basis of her original name upon her return. she returned in order to attempt to stop the invaders she saw taking t'telir after bluefingers' revolt in her vision. she was named blushweaver the honest by the iridescent tones, but in her first year as a returned successfully campaigned to change it to blushweaver the beautiful. during the rebellion[edit] ""“by inviting that woman into our city, we may have initiated the end of returned rule in hallandren. ”-blushweaver to lightsong"" when blushweaver returned, she was given a seat on the council of social ills, where she weekly participated in important votes. she was one of the oldest living returned during the events of the pahn kahl rebellion, having returned about fifteen years previously. blushweaver, aware of the subtleties of politics, was very active in trying to defend hallandren and their way of life. to this end, she had spies in idris, seeded the crowds at court assemblies with people outspoken in support of war, and lobbied the gods who had been assigned military responsibilities and therefore held the command phrases for the lifeless armies. she promised to vote however hopefinder - one of the four returned who held command phrases - wished, and in exchange he gave her the security phrase to his portion of the army. mercystar also agreed to give up her lifeless troops thanks to lightsong's unwitting help when he investigated the break-in at her palace. though blushweaver had a very warm relationship with lightsong himself, he refused to give her his lifeless commands; she also failed to convince allmother to part with her pass phrase. still, after spending her efforts on those four returned she eventually held the command phrases for half of the lifeless army. later, blushweaver was kidnapped, taken down to the tunnel system below the court, and tortured by a group of priests to force her to give up her lifeless command phrase. the false priests, in truth pahn kahl rebels, later slit her throat to show lightsong how willing to kill they were. this eventually won the rebellion control over the entire lifeless army, which they sent up to idris. blushweaver would be pleased with how the rebellion attempt ended, though it cost her her life. relationships[edit] lightsong[edit] ""“i trust her as much as i trust any other returned. but if war does come, then she’ll quickly become the second-most-powerful person in the kingdom. ”-lightsong to allmother, discussing blushweaver"" blushweaver's most notable relationship as a returned is with lightsong. they enjoy each other's company and look forward to their verbal sparring, though they also care for each other more deeply. while blushweaver would like to become involved romantically, lightsong rejects her advances. she tries to get lightsong on her side regarding war with idris, but he isn't able to bring himself to trust her completely and so withholds his and allmother's command phrases from blushweaver. the pahn kahl rebels kill her in the tunnels because they suspect lightsong loves her and want to make an impression on him. inhanna[edit] inhanna is blushweaver's high priestess, the one who delivers her votes and argues in court on her behalf. trivia[edit] - blushweaver is one of the first gods brandon named, which served as the naming standard for other gods in the court. notes[edit]"
Havarseth,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Havarseth,"""“you should watch yourself, child. not all here in the palace is as it seems. ”-bluefingers to siri."" havarseth, better known as bluefingers, is a pahn kahl servant to the god king's palace on nalthis. he is an instrumental player in the pahn kahl rebellion. appearance & personality[edit] he is described as an older man in brown robes who is balding and has a round, pleasant face. his nickname was earned by the fact that his fingers seem perpetually stained with blue ink. he often carries around a ledger. bluefingers is knowledgeable about many things, including idrian culture and the royal locks. he acts subservient to siri, asking to be excused and offering her assistance, but is also unafraid to point out the flaws in her actions. history[edit] during his time in the palace he serves as head scribe and steward, rather than a priest, due to his lack of faith in the returned. he is integral to many of the goings-on in the court of gods; according to bebid, bluefingers ""pretty much keeps the court running."" in addition to that duty, he provides a measure of guidance to siri while she is in the god king's palace. for example, he lays out all the rules for her behavior and her interactions with the god king soon after she arrives in hallandren, and meets her outside the god king's room to give her guidance about how to act. he also warns her of the dangers of bearing the god king an heir and evokes suspicions within her, which eventually drive a wedge between her and the priests. he does this because he knows that if a new god king is elected, he and the other pahn kahl servants would be dismissed from the ranks they worked so hard to earn, causing them lose all the power they gained. siri makes a deal with him that promises she will protect the pahn kahl servants if he swears to try and get her and the god king out of the palace if the priests choose to move against them. eventually it is revealed that he betrayed siri, hoping to help secure independence for his people by leading her and susebron into a trap, while the palace was in military turmoil. bluefingers, teaming up with lifeless, then captures the couple and uses them in his plans to wreak havoc between idris and hallandren. he imprisons susebron and plans to kill siri by stabbing her with a dagger, but is stopped by susebron's awakening abilities. quotes[edit] ""“my name is havarseth, but everyone just calls me bluefingers. i am head scribe and steward to his excellent grace susebron, god king of hallandren. in simpler terms, i manage the palace attendants and oversee all servants in the court of gods. ”-bluefingers introducing himself to siri"" ""“all apologies, vessel, but i'm not a follower of the returned. ”-bluefingers to siri on his faith.""

”-lightsong"" lightsong's attitude at the time of his returning was one of indolence. after meeting calmseer and starting a relationship of mutual respect turned physical with her, he gains a drive to become the god everyone expected him to be and gives up his lazy ways. this backfires when he fails miserably, leaving his followers dissatisfied and the other gods mocking him for being a hypocrite. he blames his failure on the other gods who would not take his new attitude seriously, and reverts back to his languorous ways with a newly sharpened wit which he let loose with as much vengeance as he could muster. nobody was offended by his verbal jabs, and instead took it as natural that he act in such a way; and so he perpetuated this attitude. at the time of the pahn kahl rebellion lightsong had been returned for five years, and was one of the younger divinities in the court of gods. as the god of bravery, he held the commands to control ten thousand lifeless warriors in the hallandren army. as the potential war with idris drew closer, lightsong found himself to be in a position of responsibility, one that he did not desire. blushweaver was attempting to consolidate control of hallandren's lifeless armies under her command, and was actively trying to recruit lightsong to her side. throughout this time, lightsong was having dreams of destruction and the capital city of t'telir burning. as lightsong attempted to distract himself from his visions, a murder of one of mercystar's servants caught his attention. lightsong was surprised to find himself interested in the murder, and to discover that he was actually good at investigation. believing himself to be a detective or constable in his previous life, lightsong made an effort to begin discovering more about himself and his past. when blushweaver managed to obtain control of hopefinder's and mercystar's lifeless warriors, lightsong gave his own security phrase to allmother, in the hopes that she would oppose blushweaver's call to war. allmother surprised him by giving him the security phrase to her lifeless. unable to shirk his responsibility any longer, lightsong took command of allmother's lifeless, giving himself control of half of hallandren's army. when the vote was called to go to war with idris, lightsong walked away without casting his vote. ""“you were a scribe, and you were one of the best men i'd ever known. you were my brother.”-llarimar to lightsong"" on the night of the pahn kahl rebellion, lightsong and llarimar entered the tunnel complex under mercystar's palace, where he stumbled upon blushweaver being held captive by pahn kahl scribes disguised as priests. convinced that he was previously an investigator and a skilled swordsman, lightsong attacked the pahn kahl, only to discover that he did not know how to fight. after being captured and thrown into cages, llarimar finally lost his patience with lightsong, shouting at him and telling him that he had actually been an accountant, not a detective. the pahn kahl demanded his security phrase, and slit blushweaver's throat when he refused. horrified, lightsong gave them his phrase when they threatened to do the same to llarimar. when the pahn kahl prepared to execute susebron, lightsong remembered the moment of his death, and the vision of the future he had been granted. realizing that this is what he had been sent back for, lightsong sacrificed his life to heal susebron, restoring his tongue. susebron, now able to awaken, overpowered his captors and was able to prevent the war from taking place. relationships[edit] llarimar[edit] lightsong's high priest, llarimar was also lightsong's older brother, although lightsong forgot that fact when he returned. llarimar maintains a calm persona, even when confronted with lightsong's foolish behavior, such as calling him ""scoot."" a true believer, llarimar even educates lightsong on his own religion and offers encouragement when lightsong is feeling despondent. calmseer[edit] in his early returned life, lightsong had a close relationship with calmseer, with whom he was rumoured to have slept with. lightsong regards some of the gods of this period, including calmseer and brighthue, as very honorable; he remembers them with reverence, saying they are far better and greater than the later gods. blushweaver[edit] his most notable relationship at the time of the pahn kahl rebellion is with blushweaver, who is in love with him. whilst their conversations are highly flirtatious, their relationship never becomes physical in nature, despite blushweaver's attempts. even though lightsong admires and cares for blushweaver, he opposes her desire for war with idris. siri[edit] after realizing that siri is a naive young woman and not a cunning spy sent by idris, lightsong takes pity on her and gives her advice on dealing with the politics of the court of gods. siri thinks of him as the best of the returned gods in the court at the time, and comes to rely on him even though he advises her not to. quotes[edit] ""“not a god, but a scribe. a silly little scribe who was allowed to play god for a few years! a coward. ”-lightsong about himself"" ""“you are a god. to me, at least. it doesn’t matter how easily you can be killed, how much breath you have, or how you look. it has to do with who you are and what you mean. ”-llarimar to lightsong"" ""“so far this day i have discovered several disturbing and redefining elements of my soul which are slowly restructuring the very nature of my existence. other than that, it was uneventful. you? ”-lightsong to siri"" ""“i've tried for years to corrupt him. never seems to work. i can't even get him to acknowledge the theological paradox it causes when i try to tempt him to do evil. ”-lightsong, talking about llarimar"" ""“you're the one that makes us laugh, even while you insult us. can't you see what that does? can't you see how you've inadvertently set yourself above everyone else? you didn't do it intentionally, lightsong, and that's what makes it work so well. in a city of frivolity, you're the only one who's shown any measure of wisdom. ”-blushweaver"" ""“by the colors... i am a god. ”-lightsong just before healing susebron"" trivia[edit] - the sword - gave to his wife emily at their wedding is called lightsong. - the relationship between lightsong and llarimar is a parallel to the relationship between siri and vivenna. - lightsong was designed as a character that could fit in an oscar wilde play. notes[edit]"
Sisirinah,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sisirinah,"""“but surely we can bend the rules a little bit? ”-siri to treledees"" sisirinah or siri is a princess of idris and the queen of hallandren on nalthis. appearance and personality[edit] siri is an attractive young woman. she has the royal locks and has poor control over them, allowing them to follow her moods naturally. this leads her to often have blonde hair: the color of joy and excitement. siri is a hasty and impulsive youth. though she also has an inner steel, as proven by her ability to survive in the court of gods and learning to control her hair in tense situations such as her confrontations with treledees. this is also emphasized by her stubbornness which she uses to strengthen her in difficult situations. she struggles with some feelings of inferiority especially when compared with her 'perfect' sister vivenna. she recognizes that this is part of why she was always defiant as a child: partly to gain attention (something forbidden by the teachings of austrism) and partly because she knew she could never live up to vivenna's example. she likes being spontaneous and colorful, unlike her elder sister. this makes her feel a failure in idris, but helps her excel in t'telir. siri is drawn to the ostentatious and the mysterious. where many traditional idrians, such as vivenna, are disgusted by the displays of wealth and talent in hallandren, siri must force herself to not be distracted by them. attributes and abilities[edit] siri is very brave, empathetic and acts with initiative. this is best demonstrated by her willingness to sacrifice herself for her family and people in becoming the bride of the god king. later she shows these in her confrontation of susebron (which she believed could cost her her life) and subsequently her teaching him to communicate. as a member of the royal family of idris she has the royal locks. this means she can change her hair's length and color at will, though it takes effort. history[edit] childhood[edit] ""“there were great advantages to being unimportant ”-siri thinking about herself"" siri is the youngest child of the idrian royal family, and spent most of her youth feeling and being largely redundant. her oldest sister, vivenna, was being raised to marry the hallandren god king, her only brother ridger was set to become the next king of idris, and the second-youngest daughter, fafen, had joined the austrian monasteries, as one child from each idrian family was expected to do. siri had no particular expectations on her, and so whiled away her days ignoring her tutors and pushing austrism's conservative limits. she refused to control her royal locks, instead letting her hair always reflect her emotions; she picked colorful flowers and gave them to the children of bevalis. her father typically ordered siri to work in the royal kitchen when he bothered to address her misbehavior at all. unbeknownst to him siri was friends with the cook, mab, and enjoyed the work. arrival in hallandren[edit] when the time came to fulfill the treaty he had signed with the god king, king dedelin decided to send siri to wed him in vivenna's place. so at seventeen, siri found herself ripped from her carefree life and deposited in a carriage to t'telir. she spent the journey trying to come to terms with her father's decision, mostly by yelling her confusion at the small group of guards that accompany her. as she arrived in the capital, siri was taken aback at the massive lifeless honor guard that met her, and the pervasive color that decorated every person, building, and market square. she gathered herself enough to order her equally overwhelmed guards to leave her and return home, and siri vanished alone into the court of gods. siri was stripped, bathed, dressed, and groomed in a whirlwind of activity as a pahn kahl scribe called bluefingers explained that there would be no formal wedding ceremony. she, the vessel, would simply enter the god king's bedchambers and await his whim. she was told she could not talk to, make eye contact with, kiss, or even proactively touch susebron, but must enter, strip, kneel, and wait for his signal to approach the bed. then siri was led, in a dress magnitudes more extravagant than anything she had ever seen, to the god king's chambers. siri spent that night, and many after it, kneeling until she passed out from exhaustion in front of a silent, unmoving figure who would be gone when she awoke. after a week siri was presented to the court of gods where she met lightsong. over the course of several weeks siri acted out by degrees: she sat up and made eye contact with susebron, she refused to completely strip, she began curling up in her dresses and sleeping on the floor, and finally, after treledees informed her that the priests listened in on the chamber at night, she faked the sounds of sex and fell asleep on the bed. each night the god king only watched her silently. befriending susebron[edit] one night, after siri's performance, she was startled by a figure looming over her. susebron had risen from his throne by the bed and approached her where she laid. siri shrieked in terror but when her reaction appeared to startle susebron, her fear was replaced with confusion. the god king pulled out a book of children's stories, gesturing silently for her to read it, and siri realized that susebron had no tongue. coming to the conclusion that susebron was essentially a prisoner in his own palace, siri agreed to teach him to read. each night after that one, siri performed her act on the bed, although at some point she stopped doing this, then she and susebron sat up all night, as she taught him to read and write they began having conversations with the aid of a small chalkboard. siri learns that most of susebron's character is formed from a mix of the fairy tales in his children's book and lessons he received from the priests when he was young. his simplistic worldview, strong moral backbone, and cautious rebellion against his gilded cage drew siri to him, and she began planning how to protect him as well as herself from the threat she suspected the priests posed. at one point siri asked lightsong to call a storyteller to tell her about the history of hallandren, specifically previous god kings and why they all died after their heir was born. at another point siri extracted a promise from bluefingers to smuggle her and susebron to safety if the threat to susebron's life became too great. eventually siri realized that she and susebron had fallen in love, and they began actually sleeping together. being concerned with both her and susebron's safety, when susebron's high priest talks to her and guesses how she's thinking, she realizes that the priests are 'reading' her emotions from her hair and begins practicing keeping it stable, as her sister vivenna always did. the pahn kahl rebellion[edit] siri devised a plan to explain to lightsong that susebron could not speak, and with him convince the other returned to demand to hear from their king, exposing the priests' deception; however as she headed to the assembly to meet with lightsong, she was cut off by a group of priests. they informed her that she was to go into seclusion due to her ""pregnancy"" and moved her to a room outside of which they posted a guard. siri waited in the room, occasionally hearing the sounds of fighting, until treledees appeared and took her to another room, full of priests who surrounded susebron. bluefingers offered to take the two of them through the tunnels to the docks, and treledees assented, but as they headed out of the room siri realized that the pahn kahl are the only group likely to benefit from the conflict that had consumed the god king's palace and would soon consume two nations. she confronted bluefingers and he ran off. returning to treledees and the priests, siri and susebron attempted to fight their way out of the palace, but are met at the entrance by two groups of bluefingers' fighters. the priests unflinchingly sacrificed themselves in defense of the god king, but bluefingers' group overwhelmed them and siri and susebron were taken captive. susebron was taken away and bluefingers led siri to an altar deep within the palace where he intended to kill siri and make it look like ritual human sacrifice to push idris and hallandren into war. however susebron appeared at the last moment, mind and tongue healed by lightsong's sacrifice, and rescued siri. with the aid of vasher, susebron counteracted the last effects of the rebellion, and war was averted. relationships[edit] family[edit] she is the daughter of king dedelin of idris, and the wife of the god king susebron. she is the sister of vivenna, ridger and fafen. as a member of the idrian royal family, she has a lineage that traces back to vo. susebron[edit] siri's marriage was arranged by her father, who sent her, instead of vivenna to fulfill the treaty. at first, susebron was a stranger to her, this person who just sat there in the darkness at night. eventually, susebron approaches her, showing her a storybook. this is the start of their relationship in more than an official sense, as she teaches him how to read. they grow closer through siri's lessons, and they start communicating through writing. they share parts of their cultures with each other, and siri even comments that he knows her better than anyone back at home.they grow to truly love each other. when bluefingers and the pahn khal try to take over they are both captured, and bluefingers intends to kill them. thanks to lightsong, susebron manages to save her. when siri and vivenna reunite, susebron talks with vivenna, who remarks in her thoughts that she can tell just how much susebron and siri love and understand each other. returned[edit] siri initially find's lightsong's playful banter to be an insult, but quickly realizes that he means no harm and warms up to him after he helps her navigate the politics of the court of gods. she believes that he is a good man, albeit a strange one. priests[edit] siri enjoys llarimar's helpfulness, contrasted by the discourteous attitude she's experienced from the priests in her own court. notes[edit]"
Riina,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Riina,"""“there is precisely one being i fear on this planet. ”-xisis in reference to riina"" riina, also known as the sorceress, is a member of the ire and was a resident on lumar considered one of the most dangerous people on the planet. appearance and personality[edit] appearance[edit] in the cognitive realm of scadrial, riina was a withered husk. on lumar, riina appears to be a woman in her fifties (when she gained the ability to stop aging) who is short and plump. like most elantrians, she dislikes makeup as she thinks it takes away from the effect of her glowing skin. personality[edit] ""“in her case, in lieu of a soul, the woman had pure ice. kept cold and frozen by her heart.”-hoid describing riina."" riina is known to be unusually cruel. she curses anyone who enters her domain and survives, as well as anyone who attempts to talk to her. she personally delights in coming up with cruel curses, spending her spare time coming up with new ideas for them. as part of this she also ensures that the cursed individual is aware of the full details of the curse, but also are incapable of talking about it with others and thus unable to ask for help. this is done intentionally on her part in order to make the curse more cruel for the afflicted. all those who have met her attest to her being a cruel and heartless individual. even xisis considers imprisonment under him to be a mercy when the alternative is meeting riina. she also seems to enjoy the reputation of the sorceress. despite it being unneeded, she is known to speak in rhyme while placing a curse on someone. at the same time, she shows a certain level of disdain for those on lumar, as she considers folklore about her to be funny nonsense and dismisses their technological achievements. she is also opinionated about seemingly inconsequential things, such as believing that spaceships should have sliding doors. riina herself, like most elantrians, is known to be very cautious and unwilling to take any risks that may involve her dying. this is a motive for her arriving to lumar, a system where she does not think she can be opposed and whose technology is vastly inferior to her own. when faced with a force that actually has a chance of stopping her, she retreats. even the knowledge that a dragon is on the same planet as her is enough to spook her. riina is paranoid to the extent that she keeps vats of acid nearby on the of chance that a kandra will try to act against her in some way. despite this caution, however, hoid considers riina easy to manipulate. attributes and abilities[edit] riina is an elantrian and awakener. riina is also capable of using aondor in order to grant curses to others. they are formed through long strands of aons, which can be seen wrapping around the cursed, lining up with aon equations; the person given the curse is aware as to what the stipulations of the curse are. when placed upon someone a requirement is made to break the curse, other than meeting this requirement there is no way to break the curse, not even riina herself can achieve this. the curse itself however can be altered by other elantrians. an aspect of the curse is always consistent which is that the cursed individual cannot discuss the curse with others; any attempt to do so leads to them stuttering. the curses are flawed, however, in that since they cannot be changed, they can be manipulated if one finds a way to do so that riina failed to prevent. one way to do so is by identifying what an individual cannot talk about. this indirectly reveals aspects of their curse. she is possibly capable of investing common animals to grant them self-awareness, making them her familiars. although it isn't clear if this is what she does, or if it just humans that she transforms into animals. other beings in the cosmere also fear riina, one of which is the dragon xisisrefliel who considers imprisoning people to be a mercy when the alternative is for them to face the sorceress. he himself fears to confront her. the sorceress's army[edit] in the role of being the sorceress she had an army of some sort, most probably her metal soldiers and midnight essence. her army had gone to war against the emerald sea multiple times in the past with the emerald sea losing the conflict each time. even during peace time her forces were known to go on raids against the kingdom. this army also apparently contains ships, of which only hers can sail with any others being destroyed by her forces. in the case of midnight essence they are formed when rain hits the spores in the midnight sea. upon being spawned these beings fall under her command and follow her wishes. in order to achieve this goal she manages to set up a way to continuously grant water to the monsters formed by the midnight essence. she also possesses an army of awakened soldiers, these troops are awakened constructs and immune to almost all weapon fire on lumar. a single reptilian humanoid also is under her command. history[edit] member of the ire[edit] she was among the five members of the ire that set out on an expedition to try and capture preservation's shard. she rode on horseback and carried a decoy version of the ire's orb. she abandoned the expedition with the rest of the group when kelsier used alonoe's robes to make it appear that she had disintegrated. the sorceress[edit] many years later riina came into the possession of a spaceship and used it to travel to lumar. she chose lumar because she believed that the planet was unimportant and that none of its inhabitants posed a threat to her. whilst there, she set up her defences and eventually became known to the planet's inhabitants. over the years, she earned the title of sorceress. under this name she cursed or killed anyone who dared visit her island in the midnight sea, inspiring fear among the population. the kingdom on the emerald sea, and possibly others, attempted numerous wars against her and her army but each ended in failure. this led to further raids launched by riina against the kingdoms. ""“she took my other sense of taste. the important one. and with it went my sense of humor, my sense of decorum, my sense of purpose, and my sense of self”-hoid explaining his curse."" eventually hoid noticed riina's presence on the planet and decided to approach her. for a long time hoid had desired to become an elantrian and learned that the only way to achieve this was to be invited to become one. he decided that riina was someone who could make this happen. hoid travelled to her island and made a bet with her, stipulating that he would allow himself to be cursed on the condition that if he broke the curse, he would become an elantrian. riina agreed to these terms and cursed him, causing him to lose most of his mental faculties. the only way for hoid to break the curse was for him to re-enter her tower. over the ensuing years, riina kept an eye on hoid, but never felt worried that he would actually break the curse. arrival of tress and charlie[edit] following her curse of hoid, the sorceress continued her raiding of the emerald sea. due to these pressures the king eventually began to consider it necessary to wage war against the sorceress. in order to justify this, he began seeking out more support for a war among the populace. as part of this effort, he sent charlie to riina with a marriage proposal under the guise of that this arrangement would be a path toward peace. in truth, he expected the sorceress to harm charlie, giving him the ammunition he needed, as well as popular support, for a war. upon charlie's arrival, riina ordered her troops to take him to his tower. whilst there, she sent a ransom to the king demanding he hand over souls of the royal family for the freedom of charlie. whilst waiting for his response, she and charlie talked for a time and she learned of his love for tress. when it had become clear that the ransom would go unpaid, riina elected to curse charlie, turning him into a rat. she set the terms of breaking the curse to be for him to bring tress to the sorceress to be cursed herself. following this, she allowed him to leave and began further raids against the emerald sea. for the next few months, riina would largely ignore the outside world and focus solely on the activities of hoid and charlie on the planet. at some stage she managed to hack into fort's translation device allowing her to see and hear what he did. this served as an easy way for her to keep tabs on the crew of the crow's song and hoid himself. hoid speculates that it was around this time she grew worried that he might actually make good on his bet and so began work to sabotage him further. eventually, by happenstance, both charlie and tress arrived on the boat and riina was able to keep tabs on them as well. she watched tress' journey to the midnight sea, and eventual capture by the sorceress' midnight essence. upon arriving, tress attempted to barter for charlie. riina played along, attempting to pass one of her spies off as charlie using lightweaving. tress was about to leave the tower with the fake charlie when she realized the ruse and turned back to confront riina, who then explained the full details of charlie's curse to tress. while having this conversation with the pair, she failed to notice the crew of the crow's song arriving at the island. riina became distracted attending the defense of her island, giving tress and charlie the opportunity to use her computer to communicate with fort and salay. during their conversation, tress realized the nature of hoid's curse. knowing that hoid's curse would be broken if he reached the tower and that he could potentially defeat the sorceress, she instructed salay, fort, and ann to bring hoid with them to the tower. during all of this, charlie had been trying to reach the door of the tower, but the sorceress' cat, lacy, had been making that impossible. as salay, fort, ann, and hoid finally arrived at the base of the tower, he told tress to distract the sorceress as he made a last ditch effort. tress did distract the sorceress, and the sorceress began to prepare a curse for tress using aondor. just as the curse was about to transform tress, hoid burst into the tower and blocked it with his own aondor spell. after a brief conversation, riina offered to let the crew leave the island. tress refused and instead demanded riina herself leave the planet for her crimes against the inhabitants of lumar. riina dismissed this threat until tress ordered hoid to help and he indicated that he would. riina weighed her odds and decided to comply with tress' order. after tress and the crew left, she departed the planet in her tower, which was also a spaceship. trivia[edit] - although never stated by the text itself, the painting by - depicts riina as trying to cast the - on tress. this aon is about transformation and also uses illusion magic, indicating that the sorceress was planning to have tress's curse revolve around an illusion or transformation. notes[edit]"
Lemex,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lemex,"""“i’ve gained notoriety through abusing the souls of others. and now i’m dying. ”-lemex's dying confession to vivenna"" lemex is an idrian merchant living in t'telir and king dedelin's chief spy in hallandren. as head of the spy network, lemex is the only one besides the king who knows who all of the other spies are and what projects they work on. appearance and personality[edit] ""“but…i felt so powerful. i could make the very dust of the earth obey my command. it was for the good of idris! ”-lemex to vivenna"" lemex is a crafty, intelligent man in his fifties, an age which is considered older, though up until denth begins poisoning him he is sprier than might be expected due to his wealth of breaths. when vivenna meets him for the first time, he is bed-ridden with fevers that leave him pale and clammy, delirious, and thin. the power he feels from having such a large supply of breaths compels him to buy more and more breaths. lemex justifies doing what he, a follower of austrism, feels is wrong by focusing on how his aura allows him easier entrance to parties and to court assemblies to gather information he might not otherwise have access to. he seems to be a patriot honestly working for the good of idris despite embezzling money from the king at the same time. lemex's greed and desire for a lengthened life also spur him to stockpile breaths, though, and some of the things he writes to king dedelin added to the way he hides money around his house leaves some doubt as to whether or not he might have turned traitor in the end. history[edit] ""“i believe that lemex was still loyal to idris... he was not a traitor; he was simply greedy. ”-vivenna"" lemex established himself in t'telir as a spy in king dedelin's service. the king funded the purchase of fifty breaths for lemex for the purpose of granting the man access to court assemblies, after which lemex began fudging numbers in his expense reports, pocketing the extra money and using much of it to buy more breaths for himself. the looming threat of war also contributed to the king's decision to send lemex even greater resources. after bluefingers hired denth's crew to aid in inciting war between hallandren and idris, the crew sought out employment under lemex as an in with the idrian community. denth began deftly manipulating lemex into unwittingly aiding the pahn kahl rebellion while making it seem like he was helping idris. however, after some time lemex began to grow less tractable; this together with the news of vivenna's imminent arrival precipitated denth's decision to poison lemex. on their way to t'telir, vivenna and parlin arranged via letter to meet with lemex, whom vivenna hoped to use as a mentor during her time in the city. when they arrived at the restaurant chosen for their meeting place, they were instead met by his employees, two mercenaries named denth and tonk fah. the men took vivenna to see lemex, who was bed-ridden, feverish and pale. denth claimed lemex had fallen ill, though the roughly five hundred breaths the man had accumulated while living in t'telir rendered him immune to all disease. in reality, denth had been poisoning lemex for some time. lemex regained lucidity long enough to have a short conversation with vivenna in which he admitted that after inheriting breaths from his predecessor, despite feeling it was wrong, he continued to seek out and buy more breaths. undeterred by vivenna's attempts to ask him for names and passcodes to allow her access to the idrian spy network, he remained fixated on his wrongdoing and kept discussing his breaths. he gave them to vivenna, who desperately did not want to take them; then, having lost the breaths' resistance to poison, he died quickly. denth claimed that lemex was embezzling from idris, a claim that the paperwork in lemex's house substantiated. when denth's crew searched his house, they found five thousand gold marks hidden in various places as well as an assortment of papers and letters documenting lemex's plans and his correspondence with king dedelin. vivenna decided to continue lemex's work, not realizing that many of his plans to disrupt hallandren's ability to wage war fell in line with denth's plans to exacerbate tensions between the two nations. trivia[edit] - in brandon's first drafts of the book, he intended for lemex to live, planning him as a spry, capable man serving as vivenna's mentor. he decided to kill him off for two reasons: he felt like he relied on the mentor trope in a lot of his writing, and he felt that lemex would become a crutch for vivenna, hindering her growth as a character. after deciding to kill lemex, brandon rewrote the mercenaries to be more competent so they could fill some of that role for vivenna while still allowing her to be out of her element in t'telir. see also[edit] notes[edit]"

personality[edit] ""“all of those stories are just tales told by people who lived lives before ours. what they say about humankind is true. i have watched and seen how people act. it is strange, for me, to interpret these things, for i do not see as normal men do. i am the god king. everything, to my eyes, has the same beauty. ”-susebron on his perception of beauty"" as a returned, susebron looks about twenty, much younger than his fifty years. he is described as having dark hair, black eyes, and pale skin, though it is revealed later that he can learn to change his appearance at will. he is naive, having grown up in a virtual prison imposed upon him by his priests. he is highly trusting of them, and refuses to believe that they may wish him harm (though it is worth noting that his faith in them turns out to be well-placed). his main source of knowledge about morality is a book of stories that once belonged to his mother, the morals of which he follows from memory. later, he begins to figure some things out for himself, though he continues to hold to the book's rules, making him honest to a fault. susebron is highly devoted to the people he trusts, including siri and the priests, and refuses to abandon either of them. nonetheless, he can be realistic in his assessment of others and is keenly aware of his own shortcomings as a ruler. he is very fond of sweets and justifies eating a lot of them by saying that as a returned, he can't gain any weight. attributes and abilities[edit] throughout most of his life, susebron was mute and unable to read or write using the common alphabet. he did, however, understand the color-coded hallendren artisan's script, which provided the only means of communication between susebron and his priests. because he wasn't taught how to awaken mentally, he was unable to use his breath to awaken. he eventually manages to learn how to read and write from siri, and has his tongue restored by lightsong, immediately gaining the ability to speak. he has been gifted with peacegiver's treasure, a sum of approximately fifty thousand breaths. additionally, he receives two to three breaths every week which causes his hoard of breath to grow steadily over time. this grants him the tenth heightening and all the abilities of the heightenings beneath it, including: - aura recognition - allows him to assess the number of breaths a person possesses. - perfect pitch - perfect color recognition - allows him to instantly and instinctively determine exact shades of colors and their hue harmonics. - perfect life sense - allows him to sense people around him. - agelessness - makes him immune to most toxins and physical ailments, as well as making him functionally immortal. - instinctive awakening - allows him to know commands necessary for what he desires to do without learning them beforehand. - invested breath recognition - allows him to recognize the auras of objects, and can tell when something has been invested with breath via awakening. - command breaking - allows him to instinctively override commands in other invested objects, including lifeless. this requires concentration and will leave him exhausted. - greater awakening - allows him to awaken stone and steel objects. - audible command - allows him to awaken objects that he is not physically touching, but that are within the sound of his voice. - color distortion - wherever susebron goes, white objects in his vicinity break up their colors like a prism, creating further colors. to show this off, he's usually dressed in white for public functions, although he wears black in private, as it is a more powerful color from an awakening standpoint. - perfect invocation - when awakening he drains objects to white instead of grey. - mental command - this ability, which is difficult to learn, allows him to give commands and awaken mentally. susebron would have been able to awaken through this ability before having his tongue healed, but was never taught how to do so. - there are rumors of other powers granted by the tenth heightening which are not understood or have not been made known by the god kings, who have been the only ones to achieve it. the peacegiver's treasure makes susebron effectively immortal, and even if he were to suddenly be cut off from his weekly supply, he could still live for over nine hundred years feeding off it. this amount of breath might also make him immune to emotional allomancy. in addition, as the god-king, he's capable of using his divine breath to heal multiple people instead of just one. whether this is because he was returned young or some side-effect of holding peacegiver's treasure is uncertain. though little has been shown of susebron's awakening abilities, he is naturally extremely powerful by the virtue of the sheer number of breaths he possesses. shortly after regaining his tongue, he was capable of controlling hundreds of individual awakened objects simultaneously. though he is a king, it's uncertain how much in the way of political skill he has, as until very recently, he's been little more than a figurehead of the priesthood. history[edit] childhood and early life[edit] susebron was an infant returned fifty years before the pahn kahl rebellion. he was born to a poor family living far to the north in hallandren, to a merchant and his wife. at the time of his return, the current god king was unable to produce a child, and so the infant susebron was given peacegiver's treasure and made the new god king after his predecessor gave up his divine breath to cure a plague. at some point either before or after his crowning, his tongue was removed so that he would be unable to use the wealth of breaths that had been bestowed on him. his mother raised him in the palace, though eventually she was ""taken away"". through the years he managed to retain a storybook she used to read him; he had heard the stories so many times and looked at it over the years that he had memorized each symbol, and the morals of the stories in the book were in part the code by which he lived. throughout most of his life, susebron resided mostly alone in the black palace of the god kings in t'telir. despite being the official ruler of hallandren, he was kept away from its people and other returned, only coming out briefly on special occasions in order to hide the fact that he was mute. at the time, he had not been taught to awaken by thought. marriage to siri[edit] ""“i don't think god kings are supposed to be ""sweet."" ”-susebron showing his lack of knowledge on metaphorical terms"" to forestall a war between idris and hallandren, susebron was promised the hand of king dedelin's daughter, vivenna. at the last moment, however, she was swapped for her sister, sisirinah, and susebron ended up marrying siri. for a long time, susebron and siri met only at night, as the priests wanted them to make a child, but neither acted, as siri was awaiting susebron's first move while susebron had no idea what was expected of him. initially, he did not understand siri, uncertain as to why she spent her nights waiting, naked, on his floor. after a nearly a week of this routine, siri approached him and berated him for doing nothing but watch throughout all the previous week. when susebron approaches, it is revealed that he has no tongue. siri, to convince his priests that they were trying for a baby, began moaning and bouncing on the bed every day, mimicking what she thought sex sounded like. after she began to perform her moaning and screaming routine for the priests, he approached her with a book, hoping to start some communication. siri taught susebron to read and write using his mother's storybook, and they started to converse, him writing on a board, and her speaking. as he and siri planned how to reveal to the other gods that he had no tongue, the two began to fall in love. he would spend long hours with her, learning about things like sarcasm and mockery, about places such as idris, and about siri's life growing up. during one of these conversations, susebron expressed an interest in meeting austre. eventually, he and siri consummated their marriage. the pahn kahl rebellion[edit] after much convincing from siri, susebron decided to finally reveal his true function in the court to the other gods, with the plan for failure being to flee with siri and bluefingers. however, before either could happen, siri was taken away by the priests under the guise of her pregnancy forcing her to stay in seclusion. almost immediately afterwards, the pahn kahl attacked the court of gods, and imprisoned both siri and susebron. the latter found himself in a cell next to lightsong, who sacrificed his own divine breath to heal him, restoring his tongue. now able to speak, and armed with enough breaths to let him instinctively awaken, susebron freed his palace from the pahn kahl invaders and saved siri. soon after the rebellion was quenched, susebron was approached by vasher, who gave him the command to the kalad's phantoms strewn about the city. he used it to send the statues after the lifeless army, which was bearing down on idris. he himself remained in t'telir along with siri, now with far more influence on hallandren politics. relationships[edit] siri[edit] ""“there is nothing so wonderful as you, even in my entire court. the mountains must be special indeed, to produce such beauty. ”-susebron to siri"" siri and susebron are married. though the purpose of their marriage is to solidify political alliances and to fulfill the agreement between hallandren and idris set up two decades previously, they come to love each other deeply. siri is not initially meant to be susebron's wife through the agreement; instead, her older sister vivenna is groomed her whole life to marry the god king. however, when vivenna turns twenty-two and the time comes that she must travel to hallandren to wed susebron, her father, king dedelin, decides to send siri in her place. despite siri's initial terror at the prospect her marriage to susebron, the two strike up a friendship which turns quickly to love. development[edit] siri, vivenna and susebron were developed together. originally, they were all characters from mythwalker, brandon's ninth, unpublished novel. susebron was unnamed in mythwalker, going only by the name of the emperor, but was likewise going to marry vivenna (vvenna in mythwalker) before marrying siri instead. the emperor in mythwalker retains the same divine status susebron has, but the details are slightly different: he's significantly younger, has been crowned at the age of ten rather than shortly after his birth, and wears black rather than white in court. he's also not a returned, as awakening did not yet exist in its current form. though the emperor is present for siri's marriage to him (in contrast to susebron), his early meetings with her go much the same as they do in warbreaker. however, as the siri in mythwalker possesses powers that would allow her to regrow his tongue, the plot requires the two to remain in that initial state of non-communication for far longer than they do now. though brandon never finished mythwalker, the budding relationship between siri and the emperor was one of his favorite parts of the story, which is why he revisited it in warbreaker. though their plot was re-written significantly to improve the pacing, the emperor's personality did not change when he became susebron. trivia[edit] - several people emailed brandon saying that lacking a tongue, susebron shouldn't have the sense of taste. however, this is a misconception born out of a common urban legend that the taste buds are segregated by taste on a person's tongue, while in reality, the roof of the mouth also has them. - though susebron believes that he has hidden his book of stories from the priests, they are aware of it, though they decided to let him keep it as a memento. - according to brandon, susebron might not make a good god-king, but he will certainly make an earnest one. it's possible that - will become his high priest. - though susebron might appear in - , he will not be the focus of the story. notes[edit]"

Tress,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tress,"""“the girl, however, might be as you imagined-assuming you imagined her as thoughtful, soft-spoken, and overly fond of collecting cups. ”-hoid describing tress."" glorf, more commonly known as tress, is an eighteen-year-old girl who is the captain and sprouter of the two cups on lumar. she was born on an island in the emerald sea called diggen's point, where she lived until leaving to rescue charlie from the sorceress. appearance and personality[edit] appearance[edit] tress's hair has been described as the color of wheat or honey; however, she would prefer to call it light brown. her hair is incredibly unruly, requiring much care to ensure it stays tame. she tries to keep her hair in a braid with a ribbon, but strands of her hair float free in the wind. tress wears a stolen inspector's uniform, with a large red and gold coat. ulaam likes tress's green eyes, and even offers to trade one of hers for a nice deep blue one so that she would be heterochromatic blue and green. tress denies this offer however. personality[edit] ""“plenty of ordinary people live meaningful, interesting lives without needing someone like you pushing them. you shouldn't be so callous about killing good people. ”-tress speaking to crow."" tress is thoughtful and kind, with a tendency for fixation that lead to a large collection of cups and a natural ability for sprouting. tress cares for the crew of the crow's song deeply, and risks her life to keep them safe. the crew recognizes her actions, and love her for it, much to crow's disgust. tress likes to see the best in people, not willing to accept that they are bad people beyond redemption. laggart demanded his own death from tress after crow was defeated, but tress was unwilling to go through with it, as that was not her. she would rather forgive him, than do the easy thing and kill him. she is quite naive about how the world works, and has much to learn while on her travels looking for charlie. simple things like eating verdant vines, common knowledge to many, is new to her. tress is very brave and willing to go to great lengths to help others, including leaving the island she grew up on for the love of her life. rather than risking the life of her crew, tress tries to face the midnight essence alone, believing it to be her task alone and not wanting to lose any more crew. cups[edit] ""“tress cherished her cups. she had fine porcelain cups with painted glaze, clay cups that felt rough beneath her fingers, and wooden cups that were rugged and well-used. ”-hoid describing tress's cups"" tress is an avid collector of cups, and goes out of her way to get her hands on them. she used to wash windows to earn money, of which she would spend on ingredients to make pies for trading with sailors visiting the island for more cups. tress loves showing off her cups to charlie, and would always go to him to show new ones off when she got them. her cups are some of her most prized possessions, and she takes some of her favorite ones with her when she heads off to rescue charlie. attributes and abilities[edit] tress is a remarkable cook, who can make the most of whatever ingredients she has at her disposal. on diggen's point she trades for whatever ingredients are available in the port market, some of which may be past their best. realizing that fort was only cook of the crow's song out of necessity, tress takes over and produces food beyond what the crew could have expected much to their surprise and delight. tress is relatively new to being a sprouter, having taken on the role more out of desperation to be seen as useful, than because of her skill with aether spores. tress has a healthy respect for spores, and does not allow her fear to prevent her from using them. tress can manipulate spores that are considered dangerous by many, able to form a bond with midnight essence and use it to spy on crow. tress's control over verdant spores is quite remarkable, and can effectively use them to lift a ship clear of the crimson sea to avoid the spikes caused by the rain. history[edit] early life[edit] tress, named glorf after family members before her, was born to a peasant family on diggen's point. her wild hair gained her the name tress, which everyone knew her by. she washed windows for a meager living, using much of her funds to buy ingredients to make pies to exchange for cups that sailors brought her. regularly running into the duke's son charlie on the mansion's grounds, which she could access because she cleaned the windows, she soon fell in love with him despite him pretending to be a groundskeeper. while charlie was away with the duke to court princesses from other kingdoms, tress received four cups sent by him on his travels. during this time, she continued to collect her own cups, though fewer than normal, to show to charlie when he returned. leaving the rock[edit] tress tried to escape diggen's point to rescue charlie from the sorceress when the king and the duke refused to. she managed to con her way aboard the oot's dream, pretending to be an inspector with her father's assistance, but was captured and imprisoned by the crew. the ship was a smuggling ship and the crew believed her to be an inspector who was out to get them. she met huck while being held captive, not long before the ship was attacked by the pirate ship crow's song. fleeing the ship after the seethe stopped, tress walked across the verdant sea to seek passage on the pirate ship. crow's song[edit] tress managed to gain admittance onto the ship by hanging on to the side for fifteen minutes before they let her onboard. she proved her usefulness to the ship by scrubbing decks, filling pouches of spores for use with the cannons, and eventually taking over the role of being the ships sprouter. tress learned that the captain wanted the ship to become deadrunners to force the crew to be loyal. she found some midnight spores with the help of hoid, that she then figured out could be used to spy on the captain in exchange for water. tress learned to use various spores to temporarily fix holes in the ship, and later discovered that she could somewhat control the spores with her thoughts. she met with several members of the crew, who believed her to be a king's mask, despite her insistence otherwise. tress managed to convince crow that they should go into the crimson sea, and further experimented with spores to develop a flare gun that fired bullets that would spread verdant spores all over the target. she saved the ship from the unpredictable rainfalls in the crimson sea, and the ship traveled until it reached the lunagree. crow discovered the planned mutiny and defeated the members soundly, and then descended below the surface of the spore ocean with tress. deals with a dragon[edit] crow and tress came across xisis, the dragon, and crow offered tress in exchange for a boon. tress, seeing no other option, made the same offer much to the confusion of both the dragon and crow. tress and crow, both had to argue their case that the other would make a better slave for the dragon, and tress was ultimately successful when she insisted she would do everything in her power to escape. tress negotiated some gifts for her friends in exchange, and became the new captain of the crow's song. the sorceress's trials[edit] salay showed tress to hoid, who had been about to throw jugs of water overboard and who had been throwing much of their food stores overboard too. hoid revealed he was doing so under instruction from huck, who wished to convince them not to continue on to sorceress's island. the crow's song eventually arrived at the midnight sea, and tress went with huck in a small boat to try take control over the midnight essence that patrols the ocean. unsuccessful, huck used his connection with the sorceress to get them free passage to the island. tress and huck met the sorceress in person inside the tower, and after some convincing, agreed to trade charlie in exchange for tress's two cups she had in her possession. tress realized this charlie was a fake, and that huck was really charlie, and had been cursed to be a rat. the crow's song and its crew come to the rescue, and while the sorceress was distracted, tress used a magical tablet in the room to communicate with fort. the sorceress immobilized tress after realizing what tress was doing, and went to curse her to before hoid showed up to save her. tress then was able to use the threat of hoid and the rest of the crew to get the sorceress to leave the planet, after it was discovered charlie's curse could not be undone. hoid adjusted the parameters of the curse after the sorceress left lumar in her tower, which was actually a spaceship. return to diggen's point[edit] five months later, tress, charlie, and the rest of the crew returned to diggen's point aboard their new ship, two cups, after being pardoned by the king. she presented the duke with the writ they had gotten from the king, changing the law so people could leave the island. she and charlie sailed off with her family and the rest of the old crew of crow's song, with charlie now cured thanks to hoid's adjustments to the curse, so that he only had to return tress back to her home. relationships[edit] ann[edit] ann gets along with tress pretty much straight away, answering some of her questions around why she is a pirate. she helps tress get medical assistance from ulaam when she blows up her face, and helps her understand how to be a sprouter. ann is ecstatic when tress returned without crow from their meeting with xisis, and is confused at first when tress hands over the spectacles to help her with the micropsia that has been a problem for most of her life. ann is able to successfully shoot the metal men defending the sorceress and is part of the crew to rescue tress. charlie[edit] tress loves charlie so much that she leaves diggen's point illegally and heads off on a grand adventure to the most dangerous parts of the planet to try rescue him. charlie and tress understand each other well, both referring to each other as a pair of gloves, and seeing it for the compliment it is. while stuck as a rat, charlie befriends tress despite her not knowing his true identity. charlie helps tress on her journey to sorceress's island by helping spy on crow, but is against the ultimate goal of getting there and tries disrupt the journey, much to tress's disbelief. tress learns charlie was really huck the rat all along while facing the sorceress, and the two are properly reunited with hoid's assistance. the two continue to travel together, him acting as her valet, while the two properly date. crow[edit] crow initially cared very little for tress, going so far as to order her thrown overboard and left to die in the pursuit of having her crew become deadrunners. tress manages to convince crow of her usefulness, which backfires somewhat for her as crow then sees tress as a means of being able to cure herself of the spore gestation she is stuck with. crow underestimates tress, not seeing her as a threat and going so far as to prove this by defeating the mutiny tress was a part of with ease. this is also her downfall, as tress is able to out-negotiate her with xisis, and crow is left behind with the dragon while tress is able to carry on her quest to save charlie. fort[edit] fort was the cook of the crow's song, though not because he was especially good at cooking, but because he was the best of who tried cooking after weev died. he ensures tress gets fed, and not just by saving leftovers either, but setting aside food before all the dougs get at it. tress delights fort when offering to trade her cooking services in exchange for him feeding her, a trade that he is going to brag about for many years to come. when crow broke fort's tablet after learning about the planned mutiny, he was absolutely devastated. much to his joy, tress manages to get one as part of her boon from the dragon xisis. hoid[edit] despite his curse from riina, hoid does his best to assist tress in finding the sorceress's island. tress realized that his curse would likely be cured if he was brought to sorceress's island, and ensured the crew brought him along. hoid arrived just in time to save tress, defending her from riina's attack. as the new captain of the crow's song ship of which hoid is a crew member of, tress orders hoid to defend her and the crew from riina, much as she dislikes giving orders. even if he is not too keen to do so, he still steps forward to ensure riina is not able to cause further harm. salay[edit] salay firmly believed that tress was really a king's mask in disguise, and hoped that tress would help her and the rest of the crew from being executed by the king if captured. salay steered the ship through the dangerous sea around sorceress's island to bring the crew to rescue tress. thanks to tress getting the information from xisis, salay was finally able to find her father who joins the crew on two cups. trivia[edit] - although never stated by the text itself, the painting by - depicts riina as trying to cast the - shao on tress. this aon is about transformation and also uses illusion magic, indicating that the sorceress was planning to have tress's curse revolve around an illusion or transformation. - some of tress's attributes such as her pragmatic nature and not wanting to impose on people, are inspired by - wife, - , though tress is not meant to be a direct parallel of her. - the inspiration behind tress's agency in setting out to rescue her beloved, comes partly from - where the character buttercup does not pursue her love. brandon and

Fort,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Fort,"fort is a cook and trader on the crow's song, and later the two cups, on lumar. he is deaf, and communicates using a piece of nalthian technology he obtained by trading with an unknown worldhopper. appearance and personality[edit] fort is a very large man, not in the sense of being overweight, but simply being built ""on a different scale than the rest of humanity"", enough so he could easily hold a ceramic cannonball in one hand. he can be assumed to have black, curly hair like salay, due to both coming from the same island. his fingers on both hands are gnarled, but it isn't known if it is from a congenital disease or tragic accident. despite this significantly affecting his dexterity, with his fingers not being as mobile and his hands trembling as he attempts to pick up or move objects, he manages to get by and is rather capable, even if he has to do things differently than other people. however, he is unable to write, with the creation of finer shapes being difficult for him, which is one of the reasons his board was so beneficial in communication. while he is a pirate, he is firmly opposed to killing others, and doesn't want the deaths of others on his shoulders. he appears to easily buy into legends, believing in the legends of bone spores, despite never seeing them himself. he loves to negotiate and tells tress that haggling is how he hunts to honor his upbringing. history[edit] early life[edit] he was born on the islands of lobu in the sapphire sea, into a family who took the cultural idea of the hunt very seriously, and when he came of age, he decided to choose trading as his hunt. thus, he began looking for trades with those he comes across, and records them to send back to his family to be hung in their family hall. in his youth, he primarily communicated through sign language and reading lips. this was until some point where he met an unknown worldhopper, and traded for a piece of nalthian technology that could let him read what others were saying, and write out what he wants to say. this helped him immensely in his ability to communicate and properly interpret what others were saying. sailing the spore seas[edit] over his time traveling the seas of lumar, he managed to cross ten, all but the crimson and midnight sea, due to them being too dangerous to risk crossing. at some point in the past, fort was referred to by the title sir, but he rejected it by the time he met tress on the crow's song. at some point, he became a member of the crow's song. after weev died, he became the cook, despite his poor cooking ability, as he was simply the best cook on board. when hoid became a member of the crow's song, after he was bought off the whistlebow due to his curse from the sorceress, he grew fond of him and began giving him food before everyone else, despite crow not ordering him to. he was on the ship during the sinking of the oot's dream, and was confused by it along with the rest of the crew, knowing that they should have been harmless, meant to merely hold the ship in place. he examined every cannonball he knew of in the cannon and armory, and found none with defective fuses. this left him very confused and worried about what had happened, and how crow had acted about it. tress's voyage[edit] when tress came aboard the crow's song, he immediately began to show her kindness, giving her food despite crow informing him not to. he always made sure to give her and hoid food before the rest of the crew. he at first did not consider this done out of kindness, but considered it a trade for a future favour. over time, he grew close with tress and developed a bond of mutual trust. they would eventually team up, alongside ann and salay, for a mutiny against crow due to disagreements over her desire to turn the crew into deadrunners. learning of their planned mutiny via the midnight essence, crow called them to deck and attacked them, intentionally breaking his board in the process. not long later, tress traded crow for three gifts from xisisrefliel, one of the gifts was a replacement board for fort, a gift for which he was deeply grateful. tress as captain[edit] when tress left on her own into the midnight sea and was kidnapped by midnight essence servants of the sorceress, he was the one who proposed that they follow her into the sea and barter with the midnight essence to be led to the sorceress' tower. he successfully managed to barter with them over large barrels of water, and they agreed to lead him and the rest of the crow's song to the tower. seeing him outside, tress and charlie used a board in the sorceress' tower to engage in a video conference with fort. where she ordered ann, selay, and fort to come into the tower, bringing hoid along in order to break his curse. a task they accepted without opposition, fighting through the spores and metal soldiers to make their way into the tower. he helped tress after she fell down from her aonic chains, and when the sorceress refused to leave, he and salay pulled their pistols on herm threatening to fire. this, along with the threat of hoid's new aondor powers, led her to flee. with the sorceress gone, they all returned to the crow's song, and he rolled out some alcohol he had been saving for such an occasion. months later, they had sold the crow's song and got a new ship known as the two cups, looking for a new start. he helped the crew by teaching them some sign language, which helped with communication without having to yell over the sound of wind,

Kalad's Phantoms,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kalad%27s_Phantoms,"kalad's phantoms are an army of unconventional lifeless created by vasher (then known as kalad the usurper) during the manywar on nalthis. they were later hidden in plain sight as statues known as the d'denir celabrin. characteristics[edit] kalad's phantoms are a version of lifeless made of awakened human bones encased in stone, in the form of massive warriors. their stone bodies are larger than a human's, and they are faster and sturdier than other lifeless. most of them also have stone weapons and armor. they are very strong in order to move their stone bodies, and conventional weapons are virtually useless against them. the phantoms can be placed in stasis by leaving the bones invested with just enough breath to hold them together. since they do not consume ichor-alcohol like other lifeless, they can remain in this state indefinitely, and vasher designed them to last a very long time. a significant influx of additional breath is needed to animate them. history[edit] creation and the manywar[edit] vasher invented the phantoms sometime during the manywar. during this period, awakening was still a relatively new concept and the five scholars were regularly making significant breakthroughs that contributed to the beginning of the manywar. discoveries by yesteel and shashara led to nations building up huge fighting forces made of both humans and lifeless. however, vasher's phantoms were so powerful that they could destroy larger armies while sustaining almost no losses. the research of the five scholars eventually led to shashara's creation of nightblood, his ""horrifying"" use in the battle of twilight falls, and shashara's death at vasher's hand to prevent her from sharing the secrets of nightblood's creation. vasher subsequently recalled the phantoms from battle (presumably in kuth and huth) back to hallandren. the presence of the phantoms effectively ended the manywar, and vasher came to be known as ""peacegiver the blessed"". stasis[edit] after peace was restored, vasher put the phantoms into an inanimate state so that they appeared to be warrior statues. hallandren lore holds that peacegiver ""commissioned"" a large number of these statues known as the d'denir celabrin, ostensibly as memorials and reminders not to go to war. the oldest d'denir-those created by vasher-are in the d'denir garden. the returned continue to build more statues each year throughout the city to honor peacegiver's tradition, although these are not phantoms. the people of t'telir often put colorful clothing on the statues for fun. some statues, particularly those located in the idrian slums, have been defaced or broken. ""“d’denir statues stood in a solemn line, arms upraised, weapons at the ready, as if in defense of the people. ”-vivenna, visiting the d'denir garden"" modern citizens of hallandren did not know that kalad and peacegiver were the same person, as the records from that era were all destroyed. kalad was thought of as power-hungry and dangerous, while peacegiver was believed to have defeated kalad and ended the manywar through diplomacy and negotiation, saving the city. hoid showed up in hallandren, knowing more about the true nature of kalad than most, but even he did not know all of the specifics. local legends reflected the destructive power of the phantoms and although they were mostly thought of as mythical, some people still believed that they were real. at some point, the phrase ""kalad's phantoms"" entered the vernacular as a curse. return[edit] ""“""there are some thousand original d’denir in the city, and most of them should still function, even still. i created them to last.” ”-vasher"" after bluefingers betrayed hallandren and co-opted the lifeless army, vasher revealed his true nature to siri, vivenna, and susebron. he told them that at least one thousand of the oldest d'denir statues were actually his phantoms, and, at vivenna's urging, gave susebron his security phrase. as god king, susebron had over fifty thousand breaths and was able to reanimate all of the phantoms, sending them to stop the lifeless army from marching on idris. the phantoms easily destroyed the army, and they remained in siri and susebron's control. vasher was left feeling cynical about reactivating a weapon like the phantoms. notes[edit]"
Vasher,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Talaxin,"""“i have trouble talking. i get frustrated. i snap at people. doesn’t make me very popular. but i promise you that i won’t lie to you. ”-vasher to vivenna"" vasher, kalad the usurper, strifelover, peacegiver the blessed, talaxin, zahel, or warbreaker the peaceful is a returned from nalthis. he helped create the awakened sword nightblood and is one of the five scholars. appearance & personality[edit] ""“i’m old, son, repeating myself makes me eat the wrong flower. ”-zahel to renarin after asking him to jump in shardplate."" vasher is a tall man who has trouble expressing himself. he lets his anger get the better of him, and is rough around the edges. vasher's memory has a few holes. he is usually grumpy. during most of the pahn kahl rebellion, he looks ragged. he wears ragged brown clothing, ripped in places, and wears loose trousers tied at the waist by a simple rope. his facial hair is halfway between a beard and just scruff. his hair is unkempt and comes down to his shoulders. as a returned, he can change his appearance at will. when he wants to show his returned form to susebron, for example, he becomes taller, muscular, and clean-shaven; his hair color becomes golden and he displays a color-enhancing aura. on roshar he also appears long-haired, and he wears a short but scruffy black beard. he wears loose tan clothing tied with ropes, with a robust build and a scar on his cheek. his eyes ""seem old"", but his skin doesn't seem wrinkled enough to match them. he has a low, scratchy, grinding voice. he becomes a swordmaster and joins the ardents, though he knows he is not good at this second job. he uses exclamations and phrases involving colors, which often confuse the rosharans. attributes and abilities[edit] returned[edit] as a returned, vasher has a divine breath, making him automatically of the fifth heightening. however, over the years he has learned to give away all of his breath except for the one divine breath that keeps him alive. as long as he has that one breath (which he’s learned to suppress and hide), he can stay alive. on roshar, he uses stormlight to keep himself alive. though he cannot use it to awaken, he can still sense people. he can draw investiture from highstorms, but doesn't have access to surgebinding. the method he uses involves the gap in his spiritweb left by his divine breath. awakening[edit] vasher has a lot of good information, and a handle on what he doesn’t understand. he can trivially issue three commands in one awakening, which is a difficult task for some awakeners. vasher has also developed innovations in the application of breaths. he created kalad's phantoms, a near-unstoppable army of lifeless stone soldiers. he is also one of two known awakeners who have created sentient inanimate objects, having created nightblood. apart from the scholarly aspect, he is also extremely capable at using awakening skills in combat. with clothes and awakening skills only, he is able to casually defeat kaladin, who was wielding a living shardblade. he has not figured out how to awaken using stormlight. swordsmanship[edit] ""“you think like vasher. do you know vasher? he teaches swords to people now, which is funny because varatreledees always says vasher isn't any good with the sword. ”-nightblood to szeth"" vasher is a very skilled swordsman, with three hundred years of practice along with his returned speed and strength. he could reasonably beat anyone alive in a fair sword fight. though he has admitted that he is not the best swordsman because his temper gets in the way, his ingenuity in combat gives him an edge. denth states that vasher was not a duelist, though this is likely in comparison to the other five scholars, who are leagues above any mortal in fighting prowess. he is open to using ""cheap tricks"" in combat, such as transferring breaths to stun his opponent, to make up for any skill gaps in a duel. a clear indicator of his sword-fighting prowess is that on roshar he is a highly sought-after alethi weapons-master, having directly trained both of the kholin children and kaladin in the use of and defense against shardblades. his familiarity with wielding shardblades presumably was honed by using nightblood, who is similar to a very powerful shardblade. history[edit] first years and becoming a returned[edit] vasher was born on nalthis and eventually died and returned. like other returned, he cannot remember anything of his life from before his return. after he returned, the cult of the returned named him warbreaker the peaceful and kept him alive by giving him breath. he formed the five scholars, along with the other returned denth, arsteel, shashara, and yesteel. vasher (then known as talaxin) and shashara created nightblood some time after worldhopping to roshar, among other things, while they were both in love. he married shashara shortly before he slew her with nightblood. he killed her in order to prevent the knowledge of its creation from being disseminated. the manywar and aftermath[edit] after the five scholars split, they all joined different sides in the manywar, each bringing different specialized knowledge to their chosen kingdoms. by the time war started, vasher was known as kalad. the true origin of the war is a topic of debate among scholars, but it is known that kalad was the man who started the manywar against the cities of kuth and huth. stories say kalad used his knowledge of biochromatic breath to create a vast army of lifeless and seize power in hallandren. he protected the kingdom with his armies, yet shattered the kingdom as well by driving the royals into the highlands. he later had a change of heart, which was so confusing for people that they thought he was a different person. because of this, he also became known as peacegiver, who defeated kalad and sent away the phantoms. kuth and huth had already been destroyed, but the other kingdoms agreed to stop the manywar thanks to peacegiver's diplomacy. peacegiver left a treasure of over fifty thousand breaths with the first god king, to be kept safe but not used. he also left the phantoms invested with enough breath to stay together but not move, ready to take action again with a sufficient influx of breath. pahn kahl rebellion[edit] at some point, vasher misinterpreted arsteel's motives in joining with denth and killed him. due to this, and vasher's killing of shashara, denth and vasher became enemies. vasher used a trick to get himself imprisoned in the god king's palace. he escaped his cell and visited a rebel called vahr. vahr gave vasher his breath in exchange for a merciful death. vasher found through a priest there was a political hallandren group pushing for war against idris, where the exiled royals lived. looking for more information on the faction involved, he met with bluefingers, who gave him information that led him into the home of mercystar, a returned who was known for her involvement in politics, yet not all that influential. he broke into her palace; after disabling some guards and creating a lifeless squirrel as a distraction, he was able to find a secret trapdoor. he found vivenna was inadvertently working with denth to create disturbances and vandalize the city, which was making the movement for war stronger. because of this, he kidnapped vivenna and took her to one of the slums, where he forced her to take nightblood to test her heart. as nightblood cannot tempt the hearts of those who are pure, she felt sick and dropped the sword, thereby passing the test and gaining his protection. she still believed, however, that denth and his team were on her side and ran back to them, only to find out they were not what they seemed. vivenna ran from them and ended up on the streets; eventually, vasher found her and rescued her, using nightblood to kill thugs who were threatening her. vasher began taking vivenna to meetings with members of the idrian community of hallandren; he had been trying and failing to convince them to stop the riots and avoid the war. vivenna asked the idrians to find a way to bring attention to their suffering without bringing hatred as well, and to become heroes to idris. after that, they continued reaching different groups of people with the same speech in favor of stopping the war. vivenna shared some of denth's plans with vasher. this knowledge tipped him into finding the daughter of one of the priests who was kidnapped to turn her father in favor of the war. during this rescue, vasher lost his temper and killed the thugs. vivenna and vasher went to the arena to watch the hallandren vote on war. they found out that siri was pregnant; at vivenna's pleading, vasher agreed to help save her. when he broke into the god king’s palace, he was ambushed by denth’s mercenaries who captured him. when vasher woke up, he was tied by his wrists to a hook in the ceiling of a stone room and tortured by denth. denth also had nightblood thrown into a bay near t'telir, but nightblood was able to get himself retrieved; vivenna found him and they went to find vasher. vivenna freed vasher from his bonds and gave him a considerable amount of breath. he began swordfighting denth; he appeared to be losing, but was confident that he would be able to defeat denth in the end. however, he ended up being thrown out the window before finishing the fight. using awakening, he survived and found nightblood, which he used to kill a group of lifeless that were sent to kill him. nightblood consumed most of his breath, but he was able to drop nightblood before dying. denth came in and asked to finish the duel. vasher was at a disadvantage, but finished the battle using his secret maneuver: he transferred breaths to denth and took advantage of the resulting moment of shock to kill him. by the time vasher found vivenna again, the pahn kahl had already sent hallandren’s lifeless to attack idris. they wanted both kingdoms to fight and be weakened, making it easier for them to gain their own liberty. although vasher felt hopeless about being able to stop the army, vivenna found out vasher's true identity and convinced him to give susebron control of kalad's phantoms. vasher showed himself as returned and told susebron how to activate the phantoms. the lifeless were destroyed, and only a couple of the phantoms were lost. vasher, accompanied by vivenna, then set off to find yesteel, who was attempting to restore huth and kuth. worldhopping to roshar[edit] vasher moved to roshar, the only planet he had been to besides nalthis. his main purpose in returning to roshar was to have easier access to the investiture, in the form of stormlight, that he needed in order to survive. he partially walked and partially took a vehicle to get from nalthis to roshar, making use of a caravan running between the two planets. he took on the name zahel; he intentionally chose a name similar to the word ""nahel"", which means ""connection to the divine"" in alethi, to hint at his returned nature. zahel became aware of the purelake at some point and told nightblood about it and its ""magic fish"", though it is not known whether that happened during this trip or an earlier one. due to a ""falling out,"" vasher was separated from nightblood after arriving at roshar. during the war of reckoning, he served as ardent and swordmaster in the kholin warcamp. with encouragement from adolin, whom he had trained before, he became the swordmaster for renarin kholin. zahel appreciated renarin’s enthusiasm, obedience, and willingness to look foolish for the sake of training. he also offered to train kaladin in using shards and defending himself from shardbearers in order to better protect the kholins. he tested kaladin by sparring with him; he recognized kaladin's skill and tenacity, but still felt that he needed more training to be fully effective. kaladin didn’t accept the offer at first, but came asking for it after the attempt on the king’s life; he brought three more men from bridge four to train with him. most of the training was given by ivis, another ardent. during the siege of kholinar, vivenna (now going by the name of azure) met both kaladin and adolin. before parting from them, she asked them to warn zahel that she was looking for him. after kaladin was asked to retire from the front lines, he asked zahel if he could become a swordsmaster with the ardents. zahel challenged him to a fight to test his skills, using awakened cloths to assist him, while grilling kaladin about his motivations to fight and his religious beliefs. kaladin recognized his fighting style as being the same as azure's, and told zahel that she was looking for him; zahel was unconcerned, as she'd have to get through cultivation's perpendicularity first. zahel didn't let kaladin join the ardents because he realized that kaladin still loved the fight. he then showed kaladin a fossil and explained that he was a cognitive shadow like the heralds and the fused, and that the only way to kill the fused would be with a weapon that could unravel their souls. he was ""not available"" to help kaladin during the occupation of urithiru. at some point vasher discovered the existence of vivenna's shardblade. relationships[edit] denth[edit] vasher knows denth as varatreledees and denth knows vasher as tax. they started out as friends, colleagues from the five scholars, and in-laws (when vasher marries denth’s sister, shashara). however, after the creation of nightblood, vasher killed shashara, making a lifelong enemy of denth. denth worked for the pahn khal and his payment would be capturing vasher and make him pay for killing shashara and arsteel. denth did respect vasher and acknowledged all the good he had done for people throughout his life. denth wanted nightblood to kill vasher, like he did with shashara; or to kill him in a duel like arsteel. in the end, denth was killed by vasher with the same maneuver used to kill arsteel. vivenna[edit] at first, vasher believes vivenna is working with denth and wants war between idris and hallandren. he kidnaps her and tests her by asking her to hold nightblood. because she feels sick from doing so, he concludes she has a good heart and decides to protect her, even after she runs from him. he teaches vivenna about the theory and practice of awakening. he also helps her get a good grip on her sword and gives her some tips on how to act. vivenna is turned against vasher by denth, an impression that is reinforced by vasher's rough treatment of vivenna when he first kidnaps her. however, after he rescues her from the streets and they train and work together, she begins to trust him more and more. after the pahn kahl rebellion, she chooses to leave behind her life as a princess to travel the world with vasher. shashara[edit] shashara works with vasher and the rest of the five scholars in their research into awakening. they eventually fall in love and get married. she draws nightblood at the battle of twilight falls, horrifying vasher with the result. she reveals the commands for creating lifeless with a single breath and wants to reveal the method used to create nightblood as well, both of which vasher opposes; they fight and he kills her using nightblood to prevent more such abominations from being created. nightblood[edit] ""“sneaking, vasher? you’re terrible at sneaking. ”-nightblood to vasher"" vasher and shashara create nightblood during the days when they are in love based on the shardblades they have seen on roshar. he renames the sword to nightblood after using him to kill his wife. vasher has something of a blind spot and some bias regarding nightblood and makes assumptions he wouldn't make for others. vasher does not usually unsheathe nightblood; all vasher has to do is throw him and let him do what he does. to vasher, if someone can be controlled by nightblood, then they must be guilty. nightblood has less of an effect on vasher. nightblood can sense where vasher is. this is because nightblood has ingested and fed on vasher’s breaths in the past, which is also why he does not become sick when touching it. in roshar, it is implied he still talks to nightblood expecting an answer, though there hasn’t been an answer in years. dalinar kholin’s family[edit] vasher considers dalinar kholin and his sons to be his friends. he speaks fondly to adolin and addresses him as a student, despite the distinct hierarchical difference between them. adolin often remembers zahel’s (vasher’s) advice and speaks fondly of his training with him. vasher also considers it to be a pleasure to train renarin due to his enthusiasm, obedience, and lack of fear of looking foolish, something that vasher says is not easy to teach. vasher trains kaladin and his men to be better bodyguards to the kholins. he sometimes watches adolin duel and shouts advice to him. vasher also gives dalinar advice on how the ardents must feel about having to choose between him and their religion when dalinar pushes for testing the boundaries of vorinism. presumably thanks to his broader worldview and lack of actual adherence to vorinism, he accepts dalinar's actions much more readily than the other ardents. kaladin[edit] ""“but boy, you’ve got red on your ears like i’ve never seen. ”-zahel to kaladin and his men"" vasher, as zahel, trains kaladin and is able to understand him, knowing that he is a profound person who asks many questions. kaladin trusts vasher enough that he later seeks his advice when he is bothered with the moral decision of letting king elhokar be killed. later still, after kaladin has been relieved of duty due to his battle shock, he seeks out the ardent to talk about his future, and after a sparring match with the man and a discussion about his own thoughts and feelings, vasher helps kaladin to begin understanding that he must find his own way rather than relying on what others want of him. trivia[edit] - vasher originated in - and - was created as a prequel

Manywar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Manywar,"""“ what some are calling a 'simple quelling of rebel factions' could easily spin into another manywar. do you want that? thousands upon thousands dead? kingdoms falling to never rise again? ”- bebid, a priest of brightvision"" the manywar was a global conflict on nalthis that involved the nations of hanald (the original name of hallandren), kuth, huth, pahn kahl, tedradel, and gys. it occurred about three hundred years before the pahn kahl rebellion. roots of the conflict[edit] the tears of edgli[edit] the tears of edgli had made hanald an economic powerhouse. the dyes that they produced were vibrant and prized throughout nalthis. however, the tears could only grow in hanald's climate. other nations were jealous and wished to take control of hanald so they could profit from the dyes. awakening developments[edit] the process of awakening lifeless had already been developed before the manywar. however, the commands that had been known previously required fifty breaths to create a single lifeless. this stymied nations' ability to create a large lifeless army, as it was simply too costly. however, one of the five scholars, shashara, invented a command that allowed for the creation of a lifeless with a single breath. alongside yesteel's development of ichor-alcohol, these discoveries allowed rulers to effectively double the size of their armies; along with the fact that the new troops did not eat, take pay, or feel pain and fear. larger standing armies could be created. this made the manywar the first conflict on nalthis to utilize lifeless in great numbers. powerful awakeners fought, and ropes were used as siege engines, awakened to throw boulders. the power disparity between those with the new lifeless command and those without was another cause of the manywar. new commands were also being discovered rapidly, and a golden age of awakening took place, due in large part to the five scholars. these new discoveries helped further learning and knowledge, but they also provided dangerous weapons. the house of idris, ruling family of hanald, was particularly interested in awakening, and gained powerful awakeners and lifeless. the returned's prophecy[edit] at that point, one of the returned had a vision of war. this ended up being the catalyst for the war, as it prompted vasher, then called strifelover, to strike preemptively against the other nations before they attacked. early events[edit] seizure of hanald[edit] after his fellow returned had a vision of war, vasher, then known as talaxin or kalad, used his knowledge of biochroma and awakening to raise up a vast army. in the beginning, it seems the house of idris made vasher their general. however, he used this army, and the royal family's own awakeners and lifeless, as well as a revolt of the people, to seize control of hanald from them. the family promptly fled t'telir. vasher also began developing a new type of lifeless, later known as kalad's phantoms, made from bone encased in stone. these troops were among the most powerful of lifeless and formed the core of his army. at some point, a few other nations including pahn kahl and likely tedradel united to form the pahn unity, to oppose hanald and vasher. the split of five scholars[edit] as the manywar began, the five scholars each seemed to go their own way. it appears likely that vasher and shashara, as husband and wife, remained on the same side. it is also likely that the brothers, arsteel and yesteel, stayed together. denth began the war attempting to make peace, but eventually joined vasher's side. the split of the five scholars gave the various nations in the manywar access to different awakening knowledge and techniques that the other nations did not have access to. creation of nightblood[edit] working together, vasher and shashara successfully managed to develop nightblood, a type iv biochromatic entity. patterned after shardblades that vasher had seen on a visit to the planet roshar, nightblood was designed to be a similarly destructive weapon. through a complex and experimental process they created a sentient sword with a command to destroy evil. unfortunately, as a sword, nightblood had no concept of the difference between good and evil, and so could be used to wreak great destruction. late events[edit] the battle of twilight falls[edit] the battle of twilight falls was the final engagement of the manywar. it was the only battle of the manywar where nightblood was used in the battle. the sheer number of casualties caused by shashara wielding nightblood was devastating. over the course of the battle, the leader of the pahn unity, the coalition of nations against hanald, was killed. death of shashara[edit] vasher was horrified by the destruction caused by the use of nightblood. shashara planned on revealing the secrets of how to create type iv biochromatic entities to the rest of nalthis. vasher disagreed, believing that he couldn't allow such powerful weapons to become widely available. he and shashara argued about it, and he ended up murdering her with nightblood to stop her. furious at the death of his sister, denth defected from vasher's side and never forgave him for it. resolution[edit] return of kalad's phantoms[edit] at some point during the war, vasher grew sick of battle and war, possibly due to what he saw nightblood do in battle. he decided to end the manywar by returning his phantoms from battle to hallandren. he took control of his own nation in an effort to end the fighting, which ended up being successful. the threat of his armies was enough to frighten all of the nations into ending the war. he was then called peacegiver by the hallandren who could not understand why he had ended the war. vasher then commanded the lifeless to stay put like statues, a gift for the city, leaving them invested with enough breath to hold their shape, but not to move. while the end of the war came soon enough to save most of the nations involved, kuth and huth, main enemies of hanald in the manywar, were not so lucky and collapsed. peacegiver's treasure[edit] vasher also gave up the majority of his breaths, around fifty thousand or so that he had collected during the course of the manywar. vasher endowed them on a priest, likely of the cult of the returned, and told him to keep them safe for him, in the event they should ever be needed. this man became the first god king. shattering of hanald[edit] formation of idris[edit] for reasons unknown to the modern world, the house of idris fled t'telir. they traveled to the northern highlands of hanald, bringing the religion of austrism with them, and established the kindgom of idris. though they had previously experimented with awakening, they turned their backs on it as a result of their recent experiences, and used the tenets of austrism to make awakening sound immoral and evil. this fear of awakening had a deep impact on idrian culture, and many superstitions grew up around awakening. for example, idrians always wear drab colors, such as black, greys, or tans, so awakeners can not use that color. however, this is based on misconception, as an awakener could use those colors anyway. as a result of this isolation and distrust, idrians are, for the most part, totally ignorant about how awakening works. formation of hallandren[edit] in the wake of the idrian royal family's departure, and vasher's step down from military dictatorship, the cult of the returned took control of the new nation, naming it hallandren. their religion eventually evolved into the iridescent tones and became the norm within hallandren's territory. the only notable exception was pahn kahl, which was absorbed into the new nation of hallandren as a province, where the people retained their own religion and culture. the conclusion of the manywar was also the foundation for hallandren's power in the region of the bright sea in the modern post-war era. legacy[edit] kalad's phantoms[edit] over time, the specifics of kalad's phantoms were forgotten and they became known as the d'denir, statues that had been a gift from peacegiver as a memorial to the thousands killed in the manywar, as well as a reminder to avoid going to war. the memory of the monstrous lifeless remained, though, as both a curse and a myth. sometimes youths would search the jungles trying to find the phantoms, to no avail. lingering tensions between nations[edit] while the war itself was over, the tensions between the nations never fully vanished. tedradel's hatred of hallandren, in particular, would remain strong well over three centuries later. pahn kahl, too, hated hallandren and wished to regain their status as an autonomous power. they hatched a plan, later known as the pahn kahl rebellion, to get idris and hallandren to go to war with one another, so pahn kahl could declare its independence in the confusion. this obsession with revenge eventually ended up destroying what remained of pahn kahl's culture. poor relations between idris & hallandren[edit] idris and hallandren would keep an uneasy peace for the next three hundred years. since the royals took the blood of vo, the first returned, with them, they had a legitimate claim to the throne of t'telir, a worry to many hallandren. hallandren still considered the idrians to be rebel province within the borders of their nation. in addition to old hatreds, idris controlled mountain passes that allowed trade routes to nations in the north, as well as copper mines. hallandren was enraged by this, and often felt that the tariffs charged by the idrians were too high. eventually, about twenty years before the pahn kahl rebellion, king dedelin of idris and susebron of hallandren arranged a treaty where dedelin would send one of his daughters to marry the god king, in hopes of forestalling war and easing the rising tensions between the two nations. the daughter would reintroduce the blood of the first returned to the lineage of hallandren, reinforcing the god king's claim on the throne. the promise of this daughter kept hallandren aggression towards idris at a minimum, at least until they got their bride. notes[edit]"
Yesteel,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Yesteel,"yesteel is one of the five scholars on nalthis, and a master of lifeless commands. he is arsteel's brother. his most well-known achievement is his discovery of ichor-alcohol. attributes and abilities[edit] ""“you're not any better at this than vasher is. you people can’t sneak at all! yesteel would be so disappointed in you. ”-nightblood on vivenna."" as a returned, yesteel can have the fifth heightening whenever he desires, and all the effects that implies, such as agelessness. like vasher and denth, yesteel probably is well aware how to hide his divine breath and appear as he wishes. yesteel is very skilled at sneaking around, a fact which nightblood knows of and mentions to vivenna. this could mean that yesteel is especially good at surpressing his divine breath and shaping himself to whatever he needs. at the very least, he is much better at stealth than vasher and vivenna. as one of the five scholars, yesteel is extremely knowledgable about awakening, and he is an expert in lifeless commands. jewels seems to believe that yesteel could bring back the memories of arsteel's lifeless body, which is far beyond vasher's capabilities of working with lifeless. he invents ichor-alcohol during the manywar, and around the time of the pahn kahl rebellion, he has devised a stronger form of the substance. despite yesteel's knowledge of lifeless, he didn't create the original command to make lifeless with a single breath--shashara did. he knows shashara's secret on how to make awakened swords. however, it's unclear if he knows how to make swords on the power level of nightblood, or more on the level of vivenna's blade. yesteel's current heightening is unclear, but if he discovered advanced lifeless commands, he had to have at least attained the sixth heightening at some point. history[edit] return and scholar[edit] like all of the five scholars, yesteel was a returned. it's unclear how both he and his brother, arsteel, returned and how they know that they are brothers. since returning, they lack memories of their past life. he joined the five scholars, and there was a golden age in discovering awakening commands for several years. among them, yesteel was considered a master of lifeless commands. unfortunately, these discoveries were part of the reason for the manywar, such as shashara's discovery of a command that could create a lifeless with a single breath. involvement in the manywar[edit] ""“shashara had been spurred on by the knowledge that she’d been shown up by yesteel and the development of ichor-alcohol. she had studied, experimented, practiced. and she’d done it. she’d learned to forge the breath of a thousand people into a piece of steel, awaken it to sentience, and give it a command.”-vasher on what drove shashara to make nightblood"" during the manywar, the five scholars split, joining different sides. vasher persuaded denth to join his side of hanald, and it seems likely that shashara also joined vasher. it is likely that yesteel and arsteel went to different kingdoms and opposed hanald, but it's unknown which kingdoms they went to. they could have gone to kuth and huth, hanald's primary enemy in the manywar, or one of the many nations in the pahn unity, who also opposed hanald. during the manywar, yesteel developed ichor-alcohol for lifeless, blood for a lifeless that meant a lifeless could stay active longer without requiring additional breath. it also made it so awakening them was cheaper. the discovery of ichor-alcohol drove shashara to research a way to make an awakened sword--a shardblade--eventually resulting in nightblood. somehow, yesteel secretly learned how shashara and vasher created nightblood. nightblood hastened the end of the manywar, but yesteel's involvement in the war's finale is unclear. post-manywar[edit] at some point, yesteel went in hiding, his whereabouts unknown to vasher. this could be because of yesteel's skill in stealth. three hundred years after the manywar, an unknown tyrant recruited yesteel to restore kuth and huth, an action which finally revealed yesteel's whereabouts to vasher. yesteel had created a stronger form of ichor-alcohol, and could be helping the tyrant to cause conflict on nalthis. if, during the pahn kahl rebellion, the hallandren lifeless army had not been stopped, yesteel would have brought kuth and huth to idris's aid, revealing the secret of the awakened swords to them. he would have pressed towards hallandren and destroyed t'telir. in the aftermath of the pahn kahl rebellion, jewels sought out yesteel, bringing arsteel's lifeless corpse. jewels hoped that yesteel, with his mastery of lifeless, could help bring back some of arsteel's personality and memories. relationships[edit] arsteel and vasher[edit] little is known about yesteel and his brother's relationship. it seems likely that he and arsteel joined each other during the manywar. it's unknown how yesteel feels about vasher killing his brother, but the murder probably doesn't endear vasher to yesteel. shashara[edit] it seems as though shashara and yesteel had a competitive relationship when it came to their scholarship. shashara came up with the first command for creating lifeless with a single breath, but since yesteel is referred to as a master of lifeless commands he was likely spurred forward to do more with lifeless. he eventually created ichor-alcohol, and the creation of the substance made shashara want to show up yesteel. she did this by researching and creating awakened swords, resulting in nightblood. notes[edit]"
Ichor-alcohol,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ichor-alcohol,"ichor-alcohol is a clear fluid invented by yesteel, one of the five scholars, to aid in the creation of lifeless. creation[edit] in the time before the manywar, the five scholars studied the magic of awakening together, seeking to uncover new commands and understand how awakening operated. yesteel discovered an ichor-alcohol during this time. this new process made it easier to create lifeless that lasted longer. uses[edit] ichor-alcohol's main use is to increase the length of time a lifeless can remain active without requiring a new breath. ichor-alcohol also makes the awakening of lifeless require fewer breaths, rendering the process easier and cheaper to perform since new breaths are less often required. it is infused into the veins of the lifeless by using a small hand pump, in order to avoid damaging the blood vessels of the lifeless. in humans, the pump is often attached to a valve in the neck of the lifeless. ichor-alcohol does have some weaknesses though. since it acts as blood to the lifeless it will need to be replaced if they become cut and drained of it. the lifeless will continue to function for a brief period of time before shutting down. also over time the ichor-alcohol can become corrupted so it needs to be regularly checked and replaced. it is important to note that ichor-alcohol is not a requirement for the creation of lifeless. the creation of lifeless without ichor-alcohol, such as kalad's phantoms, requires more breaths but they do not need maintenance like other lifeless with ichor-alcohol do. effects on nalthis[edit] the discovery of ichor-alcohol drastically altered the course of history on nalthis. it was one of the main causes of the manywar. lifeless were now cheaper, meaning kings could create armies that didn't have to eat. jealous of yesteel's discovery, shashara (another of the five scholars) tried to invent more new awakening processes. she invented new commands that allowed for lifeless to be created with a single breath. it also caused her to discover the way to create type-four biochromatic entities, such as nightblood. shashara's two discoveries also helped to cause the manywar. three hundred years after the manywar, ichor-alcohol allowed countries such as hallandren to keep large standing armies of lifeless, requiring no food and minimal maintenance. lifeless had also become far more common as servants and workers, doing tasks for their masters. the ichor-alcohol helped make it possible for the people to possess lifeless because it made the awakenings cheaper. ichor-alcohol is utilized in the creation of most, if not all modern lifeless, such as clod. a new kind of ichor-alcohol was also developed by yesteel that was somehow more potent. knowledge and use of this new variant was not widespread at the time of the pahn kahl rebellion, circa 327. notes[edit]"
Misel,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Misel,"""“but when they took misel away from me... i had to stay quiet about what had happened, had to change my arguments, or they said they'd kill her. ”-nanrovah"" misel is nanrovah's daughter on nalthis. denth kidnaps her in order to use her as leverage against her father, and nanrovah begins arguing in favor of war against idris in the court of gods. after her rescue, nanrovah retracts his support of the war. history[edit] misel was in a carriage traveling through t'telir when denth's crew staged distractions in the area and allowed a group of thieves to kidnap her from the carriage. she was kept in a dingy cage in the thieves' den. vivenna and vasher, who wanted to find the thieves to force them to explain what denth had wanted with the carriage, found their hideout and discovered misel's presence. misel was terrified by their appearance and shrank back from vivenna's rescue; however, when vasher finished fighting and approached the cage, she ran right to him. as vasher and vivenna walked misel back to her father's house, she was clearly traumatized and non-verbal. vasher asked misel to repeat a command he told her, which seemed to cause her to completely forget her dreadful experience. after that, she spoke normally to vasher and asked after her parents. vasher and vivenna delivered her to nanrovah and her mother, who were overjoyed to have her back. notes[edit]"
Denth,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Denth,"""“i've tried going back. but the darkness... it's inside. i can't escape it. my laughter has an edge to it. i can't forget. ”-denth to vasher "" denth or varatreledees is a returned from nalthis. he is also a worldhopper and one of the five scholars. he is also be a member of the royal line of idris. appearance and personality[edit] as a returned denth can change his appearance by will. during the pahn kahl rebellion denth appears as man in his thirties. he dresses in nondescript brown leather, but he keeps some color, such as his red vest. he has a long face and styled hair pulled back into a neat short ponytail. he keeps himself well groomed and is clean-shaven. his overall outlook is cynical, likely colored by his own frustration that he finds himself having to do things he feels bad about. [expand] attributes and abilities[edit] as a returned denth is faster and stronger then other people. he is also immune to most toxins and cannot die of old age. denth is a superb swordsman. he is so quick he can kill most people, even trained warriors, before they can react. even accomplished fighters such as vasher are clearly outmatched by him. denth understands awakening on an advanced level, as one of the five scholars. he is also a very skilled awakener. denth is a consummate actor and manipulator, able to deceive vivenna and the other idrians for months into setting up a war for him. he has not travelled the cosmere widely. history[edit] pre rebellion[edit] little is known of denth's life before he shows up in hallandren. denth was originally known as varatreledees and was a scholar before the manywar. he initially tried to stop the war, but ultimately took vasher's side. he now hates vasher for killing his sister shashara and does not care that vasher did it to protect the secret of awakening steel. some time after the manywar he took the name denth and created a mercenary band with tonk fah, jewels, and arsteel. at some point arsteel encountered vasher and was killed by him. denth took this opportunity to see how a dead returned works as a lifeless, and they renamed him clod. denth has also spent time on the planet roshar, though when and for what purpose remains unclear. pahn kahl rebellion[edit] ""“unfortunately, princess, we're here to kill you. ”-denth to vivenna "" denth conspires with the pahn kahl rebels to overthrow the hallandren government. denth and his band infiltrate the idrian spy network to kidnap vivenna. acting as mercenaries working for lemex they befriend vivenna after poisoning lemex to make it look like he died of illness. denth uses vivenna to increase tensions between hallandren and idris to drive hallandren to war. later, after vivenna is kidnapped by vasher, denth and tonk fah torture and kill parlin, vivenna's friend to try and discover where she has gone. when vivenna escapes from vasher and returns to the safe house, she uncovers the truth about denth and tonk fah. in the ensuing confrontation, denth is attacked by clod on vivenna's command, and she escapes. denth catches vasher while he is attemping to rescue vivenna's sister siri who is living in the god king's palace. he has vasher's sword nightblood thrown in the water so it can cause no further harm, then has vasher hung by his wrists in a room with no color in the god king's palace to interrogate him. after retrieving nightblood, vivenna assists in vasher's escape. denth is killed by vasher in a duel; vasher stabs denth after transferring what breath he had left into denth in order to stun him. vasher was not a better swordsman than denth, and this was known by both characters. death[edit] during the pahn kahl rebellion, denth fights a duel with vasher to prove that vasher is not a better swordsman than arsteel or himself, and to find out how he won. denth's fight with vasher reveals that denth is the better swordsman, however vasher is more cunning. vasher gives his breaths to denth, effectively stunning him for a moment and vasher runs him through with his dagger. as denth dies, his hair flashes between colors, eventually falling to stark white. this reveals that denth has the royal locks, independent from being a returned. relationships[edit] - denth was one of the five scholars. he was the brother of shashara and sworn enemy of vasher, another of the scholars. - he is the leader of a mercenary band including - , - , and - . - he temporarily pretends to be employed by and allied with vivenna. - he's actually in the employ of - . trivia[edit] - brandon considers denth to be ""the anti- - "", as they are both ""glib, smart, and hired to do impossible tasks""; however, denth, unlike kelsier, is the antagonist. notes[edit]"
Royal Locks,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Royal_Locks,"the royal locks are a hereditary trait of the royal house of idris on nalthis. members of the royal house can change their hair color or cause their hair to grow quickly at will. normally the color of the royal locks reflects the person's emotional state by default but this can be controlled through training and discipline. the ability to grow hair at will takes effort and leads to hunger and exhaustion. royal locks abilities can extend to facial hair. only members of the royal house that are potential heirs to the throne have and can pass on the royal locks. hair color indicators[edit] - black: calm or control - red: anger, embarrassment - , or passion - yellow (or blond): happiness or excitement - white: fear, intimidation, or panic - brown: saddened or upset not seen on screen yet[edit] - green: disgusted - pink: unknown wearers of the royal locks can imitate the grey hair of the elderly, though it is unknown whether that color is associated with a particular emotion. they can also change their hair color to unnatural colors, like pink and green. which particular color that will match up with which particular emotion is based on associations that people in the culture give them and the user's own perspective. other abilities[edit] like returned, wearers of the royal locks can also change other aspects of the physical appearance. with practice, wearers are able to change their age, height, and body shape. they don't have as much ability as a returned does though, as they cannot change their physical features enough to look like someone else. vasher suggests that all returned can alter their appearance to an extent, and points to the royal locks as evidence that the royals are descended from a returned. this indicates that all returned could potentially mimic the effects of the royal locks. on the other hand, it has been revealed that denth has the royal locks independent of his being returned. royal locks can be regrown by the holder, but it requires energy and focus. doing so makes them hungry and tired. siri describes this feeling is like moving any other muscle. those with the royal locks have a much easier time learning awakening. the hair can be sold in the markets of t'telir. history[edit] the arrangement between idris and hallandren was in part due to the people of hallandren calling for their future royalty to have the royal locks. this would further legitimize the current regime and quiet those who believed dedelin was the rightful heir to the throne. while being bathed, siri noticed a servant was struggling with snarls in her hair. she instructed her to ""cut it off"". after the hair was removed, siri regrew it. vivenna, while living in the streets of t'telir, sold her hair in exchange for a small amount of food. known users[edit] below is a list of those known to have the royal locks: vivenna has the strongest will in terms of controlling her hair, within her family. trivia[edit] - tried to work hair that would change color with emotion into - and a story set on the - world. notes[edit]"

Nalthis,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Nalthian,"nalthis is a planet in the nalthian system of the cosmere. the shard endowment resides there. it is inhabited by humans and has a number of states, including idris and hallandren. a person from nalthis is called a nalthian. a single moon named rrendos orbits the planet. nations[edit] historical[edit] current[edit] the known world contains dozens of kingdoms. geography and ecology[edit] the geography and ecology of nalthis is largely unknown. hallandren is unique in the known world of nalthis as being the only place that tears of edgli will grow, as well as being the only known jungle climate. the growth of plants in this region is partly helped by investiture, much like the elendel basin. to hallandren's east, there is an inland sea that features several islands. at least a third of the coastline is controlled by hallandren, which has its capital city built abutting the water. the area suffers frequent earthquakes. there are mountains north of hallandren, as well as toward the sunrise; those to the north are controlled by idris. these contain the only known copper mines in the world. further nations can be found north of those mountains. to the south of hallandren is pahn kahl. elephants and zebras are said to be exotic creatures from ""the south."" whether this means they come from southern hallandren or south of hallandren is unclear. the hallandren jungle is inhabited by panthers, parrots, monkeys, and crocodiles. the hallandren people have access to fine wines, sweet potatoes, figs, nuts, and garlic, among other foods; it is unknown, however, how much grows in the area and how much is imported. the bright sea is full of life, including many sorts of mussels, fish, and tentacled creatures. history[edit] early history and mythology[edit] ""“now, you may wonder why i must travel back so far. should i not speak of the manywar, of the shattering of kingdoms, of the five scholars, of kalad the usurper and his phantom army? those are the events we focus upon, the ones men know best. to speak only of them, however, ignores the history of three hundred years that led up to them.”-hoid on the history of nalthis"" nalthis was created at an unknown date, but it is not old enough to have had fossils form on it. the system was settled by endowment, who remains the sole shard in the system. humans on nalthis were directly created by endowment at an unknown point after the shattering. a perpendicularity formed on the world, and near it the tears of edgli began to grow. early in its history the nation of chedesh dominated the world, and their sailors eventually reached the area that would later become known as hallandren. the region was already inhabited by the pahn kahl, but they were dismissed as not a 'true' nation. while there the chedens discovered the tears of edgli for the first time. as the nation explored this new continent, they headed northwards; one cheden died during the trip and became the first returned. remembered by the title ""the first returned"", vo declared the five visions and then died a week later. the men on his ship received his message and founded the kingdom of hanald. they chose vo's wife as the first monarch, beginning the idrian royal line. this new kingdom quickly grew lucrative due to the tears of edgli, and their monopoly on the dyes allowed them to become a powerful economic force. for most of their history the inhabitants of the planet were unaware of the art of awakening. the death of vo helped begin exploration into this art, which was only discovered some four centuries prior to the events of the pahn kahl rebellion. the manywar[edit] prelude to the manywar[edit] austrism was the predominant religion of hanald when it was founded, and the idrian royal family itself followed it. at the same time the cult of the returned formed and began to worship the returned, believing that each individual had been sent from austre in order to fulfill a mission. they were the individuals who discovered, maintained, and named warbreaker the peaceful and glorysinger. three hundred years after the arrival of vo, these returned would be renamed as talaxin and shashara respectively and joined with other returned arsteel, yesteel, and varatreledees to form the five scholars. the years preceding the manywar were ones of quick discovery about awakening led by the scholars. beyond this, some of them became worldhoppers. their discoveries about awakening and their exploration of the cosmere cemented the legacy of these nalthians as early scholars of the cosmere by those at silverlight. tensions between hanald and its neighbors began to grow due to a wide variety of factors, including hanald's ready supply of dyes and the discovery of how to awaken lifeless with a single breath instead of fifty. in addition to this doubling the size of many armies, the use of ichor-alcohol made the already durable lifeless even stronger and longer lasting. the situation worsened even more when shashara revealed both secrets to the entire world, allowing every nation to benefit. ""“i get out of hand, vasher? me? when's the last time i started a war? slaughtered tens of thousands?”-denth to vasher about his past"" the events of the manywar[edit] despite the increase in tensions, however, the manywar was not properly triggered by any one of these factors. instead, a returned had a vision about an upcoming war and told talaxin about it, who in turn spread the news to those in the nation of hanald. the idrian monarchy refused to begin a preemptive war against their neighbors, so talaxin sparked a rebellion against them and deposed their government. talaxin rose to power as kalad the usurper and ordered preemptive strikes against the kingdoms of kuth and huth to the north of hanald. in response to this, several nations joined kuth and huth to form a coalition known as the pahn unity in order to oppose hanald. the five scholars broke up, taking different sides in the war. ""“i wanted to stop it. but by the time i realized what was happening, it had gone too far. it had taken on a life of its own.”-vasher on the manywar"" as the first real conflict where awakening and the lifeless were put to actual use on the battlefield, the war was one of nalthis' most deadly conflicts. as the war waged, more advancements were made in the art of creating lifeless and other awakened objects; this made the fighting worse and worse. during this time period, kalad also created his infamous phantoms. shortly afterwards kalad and shashara decided to attempt to create a shardblade, which they had seen on roshar, using awakening. after a period of research, the pair created the sword known as nightblood. the first battle that nightblood was used in was the battle of twilight falls, where he was wielded by shashara. the battle served as the conclusion of the manywar. kalad was horrified by the loss of life caused by nightblood; because shashara obstinately wanted to reveal the secret of the nightblood's creation to the nations, kalad felt he had no choice but to kill her.

""“you should watch yourself, child. not all here in the palace is as it seems. ”-bluefingers to siri"" siri's arrival at the court of gods created a different set of worries. it was speculated by some that the last-second swap may have been planned from the start and that deferring to the idrian monarchy actually undermined their authority rather than strengthened it. it was bluefingers' original plan to use siri to persuade the idrians within the city that a rebellion was needed, but he changed his plans once he learned that denth had kidnapped vivenna and was using her to do the same thing. he decided it was best to kill siri instead to further anger the idrians. while pretending to entertain vivenna's plans to prevent the war, denth in actuality undermined or canceled her plans when she wasn't paying attention and instead did what he could to worsen the situation and support his preexisting plans. denth's efforts ultimately fell apart when he was forced to kill a friend of vivenna's and she discovered his corpse as well as the bodies of the soldiers sent by her father. she quickly worked out their true intentions and escaped the crew. ""“when this is through, princess, idris will fight until either it or hallandren is destroyed.”-bluefingers to siri."" the rebellion[edit] vivenna was saved by vasher, who discovered how she had been tricked by denth. together, they both did what they could to prevent the war by talking to the idrians and rescuing the child of a head priest that denth had kidnapped as blackmail. their efforts were not enough, however, and the push for war was still taking place. the priests feared that the vote would come to pass and went to protect siri from a potential riot. seeing the unexpected vote of lightsong and the sudden increased security for siri, bluefingers panicked and moved to cause the rebellion that day. he immediately sent his mercenaries to go and kill the guards outside of siri's door and replace them. at the same time, he had denth go and capture vasher, who had just broken into the god king's palace in the hopes of preventing the war. during the growing conflict, the rebels managed to kill blushweaver, capture the god king, get all of the lifeless commands, and order the army to go attack and kill the idrians. the priesthood saved siri and susebron from the conflict and sent them to bluefingers for their evacuation. lightsong used his divine breath to return susebron's tongue to him; with full access to his breath, susebron quickly turned the tide of the battle, saved siri, and apprehended bluefingers. in the immediate aftermath, vasher revealed himself as peacegiver to the public and granted susebron full control of the d'denir celabrin so that they could go destroy the lifeless armies and prevent a slaughter in idris. after the rebellion[edit] following the death of denth, his crew went to make contact with yesteel, who resided in one of the kingdoms north of the mountains. yesteel himself became intent on re-forging the kingdoms of huth and kuth; hearing of this, vasher and vivenna decided to go north to stop him. over many years, their mastery over awakening and technology advanced significantly, such as creating awakened circuitry that responds to the connection of its user to predict text. cosmere[edit] the shard endowment has been confirmed to be present on nalthis. this has had the effect that every human born on nalthis is born with one breath, the source of energy for awakening and returning. endowment is related to the flowers which grow around t'telir, the capital city of hallandren. endowment has been known to revive recently deceased people, awarding them a single divine breath under the requirement that they consume a normal breath once a week to stay alive. it is believed, and confirmed for at least three returned, that all returned come back to fulfill some divine goal. it is unknown what endowment's purpose is, or how long she has been doing this. nalthians are aware of perpendicularities and wish for them to be used for trading purposes. nalthian awakened technology has spread across the cosmere to some degree, and can be seen on other planets, such as lumar. the trading of breaths are looked down upon by others in the cosmere. trivia[edit] - nalthians know what - are. - finds nalthis too colorful. notes[edit]"
Pahn Kahl rebellion,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Pahn_Kahl_rebellion,"""“ and so here you are. unable to fight. unable to free yourselves. considered second-class. and yet, if your oppressors were to get into a war, it might give you an opening. a chance to break away… ”- siri to bluefingers"" the pahn kahl rebellion is an attempt by the pahn kahl to free their people from the rule of hallandren, that occurs approximately three hundred years after the manywar. background[edit] the pahn kahl as a people harbored resentment for centuries due to the abuse they received at the hands of the hallandren: their subjugation, relegation to the lowliest jobs, and seeming total assimilation to the point that most hallandren assumed their culture no longer existed. they had worked towards a rebellion for generations, using their positions as stewards, scribes, and clerks, where they were responsible for performing many of the key functions in the palace, to gain influence in the kingdom slowly and quietly. bluefingers' position in particular was passed down from a pahn kahl before him; this type of set-up greatly aided in accumulating more and more influence. a pahn kahl named vahr led an unsuccessful attempt at a rebellion prior to bluefingers' own attempt. vahr spent more than a decade working towards the freedom of his people. he garnered the financial support of some of the idrian slumlords and some of hallandren’s economic competitors to raise an army. bluefingers, however, felt that vahr's plans threatened his own by drawing too much attention to the otherwise overlooked pahn kahl, so he leaked information to the returned to assist in vahr's capture; after this, vahr's rebellion fell apart. dedelin, king of idris, was displeased to hear of vahr's capture because he had hoped hallandren would focus on the pahn kahl in lieu of idris. it is due to vahr's capture and hallandren's subsequent renewed attention on its enemies that dedelin decided, in an attempt to stave off an impending war at least until winter, to fulfill his contract with susebron by sending siri to t'telir. preparations[edit] the tunnel system[edit] ""“the priests of the iridescent tones, it appeared, were hiding things from the rest of the kingdom. and from their gods. ”-vasher after discovering a trapdoor in mercystar's palace"" the pahn kahl who held the position of steward prior to bluefingers was instrumental in manipulating the priests into constructing an extensive tunnel system below the court of the gods and keeping it a secret from the returned. as the project continued, bluefingers used it for his own ends both by misappropriating some of the funds and also as cover for digging projects of his own. he was eventually able to use the tunnels below the court to grant covert entry to mercenaries and to pahn kahl awakeners. he sequestered a large number of the former in the tunnels in preparation for the final attack and he set the latter to the task of breaking the lifeless army. the awakeners managed to break some of the lifeless and commanded them to attack with deadly force if any idrian was aggressive towards them, which resulted in a chaotic and deadly scene when the city watch raided vivenna’s meeting with the idrian slumlords. manipulation of siri[edit] ""“doing your duty as the vessel was the danger! ”-bluefingers to siri"" when siri arrived in t'telir to marry susebron, bluefingers strived to gain her trust at the expense of the hallandren. he thought her trust in the hallandren priests would preclude war between the two nations and hoped to use her to manipulate, by extension, the idrians of the city. to this end, he invited her pity on the pahn kahl by drawing attention to their lowly stations. he also allowed her to believe he was more ignorant of palace scheming than he really was, not letting on that he knew about susebron's missing tongue, and expressed to her that his real concern was the pahn kahl not being able to retain their positions when a new god king succeeded susebron, as the usual custom was to replace all of the servants. knowing that treledees had instructed siri that she and susebron must have a child as quickly as possible, bluefingers further undermined her trust in the god king’s priests by warning her that this would actually bring danger to the couple. this plan worked to the extent that siri asked him to get her and susebron out of the palace should they become endangered. bluefingers' plan regarding siri morphed, however, when denth successfully captured and exploited vivenna in their efforts to stir up the people of t'telir, and bluefingers instead conceived of the idea of siri dying at the apparent hand of the hallandren priests. denth's crew[edit] meanwhile, denth's crew, whom bluefingers had hired for the purpose of inciting the people of t'telir, was busy out in the city. the crew attacked the supplies needed for war and, together with vivenna, incited the idrians in the slums. denth also hatched a plan to kidnap the child of nanrovah, stillmark's high priest who vocally opposed war in the debates in court. his idea was to hold nanrovah's daughter in order to blackmail him, but vivenna eventually tumbled to denth’s real motives and teamed up with vasher to rescue the girl and begin working against denth's crew. final attack[edit] the fact that the court of the gods planned to assemble to take a formal vote on war with idris precipitated a final attack in the culmination of all of bluefingers' plans. when bluefingers saw the priests act preemptively in securing the god king and queen inside the palace, he believed that they were suspicious of him and reacted by seizing both the god king’s palace and blushweaver herself from her palace. the tunnels[edit] bluefingers ordered the capture and torture of blushweaver so that the rebels could get the lifeless command phrases from her. in the meantime, lightsong entered the tunnels of his own volition, guided by his prophetic dreams and seeking the answer to why tensions between the two nations had risen so high even after the wedding. he and llarimar, who came with him, stumbled onto the group of pahn kahl posing as priests as they tortured blushweaver, and they were both captured in their rescue attempt. after their success extracting the command phrase from blushweaver, the pahn kahl killed her in front of lightsong and obtained his command phrase when they threatened to kill llarimar too. ""“by the colors... i am a god.”-lightsong"" after bluefingers sent susebron down into the tunnels, he ended up in a cage next to lightsong. bluefingers planned to leave susebron's body in the palace dungeons and to place blushweaver's and lightsong's bodies in the lifeless barracks surrounded by the corpses of idrians. when the pahn kahl retrieved susebron from his cage in order to kill him, however, lightsong thwarted their efforts by giving up his divine breath (and his life with it) to heal susebron's missing tongue. the palace[edit] when susebron's priests heard about the impending vote, they were concerned for the god king and queen's safety and sequestered them in the palace under the pretext of discovering that siri was with child. after the fighting began, treledees took siri to reunite with susebron. bluefingers arrived and suggested that they flee through the tunnels under the palace, but on the way there siri put together the facts and understood that really this was a rebellion of the pahn kahl, with bluefingers as the ringleader. they instead headed towards the front gates. vasher attempted to break into the palace to rescue siri at vivenna's request, but denth and his mercenaries ambushed and captured him outside siri's door. vivenna came to his rescue and successfully freed him, but after being knocked out a window in the ensuing fight, vasher was forced to draw nightblood, who consumes breath when unsheathed, in his effort to get through a group of soldiers and back to denth. having successfully manipulated vasher into losing most of his breaths, denth then challenged him to a duel. vasher in his weakened state was no match for denth. just before denth was about to kill him, vasher transferred his few remaining breaths to denth, inducing such momentary ecstasy as to provide vasher an opening to kill denth with his dagger. ""“you want me dead, then have the decency to let me die standing up.”-siri to bluefingers"" meanwhile, treledees and the other of the god king's priests took siri and susebron towards the front gates in an attempt to escape the palace. bluefingers and a force of lifeless ambushed the group and killed the priests; susebron was sent into the tunnels while bluefingers took siri to a room on the fourth floor. there, he intended to kill siri and place her on an altar surrounded by the corpses of hallandren priests as proof that they only wanted her to come to t'telir so they could sacrifice her to the god king. the rumors that she was with child would only make her death in such a manner more powerful. susebron's healed tongue, which lightsong restored to him in the tunnels, allowed him to use peacegiver's treasure, the fifty thousand breaths of which he was guardian. with such an incredible awakening force, susebron efficiently quelled the rebels' attack on the palace with a storm of awakened cloths and rescued siri from bluefingers' clutches. the lifeless army[edit] upon obtaining the command phrases from blushweaver and lightsong, a small group of pahn kahl imprinted the whole lifeless army of hallandren with a new command phrase. bluefingers directed them to give the army orders to march on idris. all those who knew the new command phrase were then to kill themselves with poison so that no one would be able to stop the attack. bluefingers intended to stage a scene in the now empty lifeless barracks: with susebron's body in the dungeons, he hoped that when the hallandren found lightsong and blushweaver, the sole two holders of the army's command phrases, in the barracks surrounded by the bodies of idrians, it would appear that lightsong and blushweaver sent the army to idris in revenge for their god king's death. aftermath[edit] ""“they are your responsibility now... do better with them than i did. ”-vasher to susebron"" vasher and susebron each independently considered going after the lifeless army and trying to defeat it, but were talked out of it. after nightblood revealed vasher's true identity to vivenna, she realized vasher knew where kalad's phantoms were and how to activate them; she convinced him to share the information with susebron. susebron used the command phrase to mobilize the statues, and they stormed after the lifeless army marching on idris. upon reaching them, kalad's phantoms destroyed the whole force with ease. if the war had occurred, yesteel would have supported the idrians by giving them the knowledge to create awakened swords like nightblood; this would have tipped the scales in favor of idris and its allies, resulting in the destruction of t'telir and throwing the region into chaos. notes[edit]"

Leyten,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Leyten,"leyten is a windrunner and member of bridge four on the planet roshar. he is the quartermaster of the windrunners under kaladin stormblessed, and as such is responsible for keeping them supplied with uniforms and other items. appearance and personality[edit] leyten is thick-bodied and has an oval-shaped face. he is tall, stout, and has light, short curly hair. he has an affable nature, finding it easy to talk to people no matter their rank. history[edit] bridge four[edit] leyten was an apprentice armorer prior to becoming a bridgeman, but when a lighteyes' armor broke and he took an arrow in the shoulder, the blame fell on leyten. as a result, he was demoted to work on the bridge crews. on the first bridge run after kaladin's promotion to bridgeleader, leyten dropped after taking two arrow wounds in his shoulder and the opposite arm. another arrow grazed his stomach and his left leg was trampled by a horse. teft and rock carried leyten to kaladin, who insisted on treating his wounds. leyten fell unconscious and kaladin feared he wouldn’t make it. however, he still pulled the arrows free from his arms and cauterized the wounds, then splinted leyten’s leg using the arrow shafts and cauterized that wound as well, saving the man’s life. the crew brought him back to the barracks by tying him to the top of their bridge while they ran and then quickly untying him before the army crossed. leyten’s wounds soon became infected, causing kaladin to enlist rock and teft to help collect knobweed sap for its antiseptic qualities. the knobweed sap worked, and soon leyten was up and about, though he initially had a lot of trouble walking due to his crushed leg. leyten’s condition continued to improve, even joining the rest of bridge four in the chasms for spear training and harvesting. after the success of using the parshendi carapace armor, leyten was tasked with crafting additional sets for every man in bridge four. he expertly crafted it to fit on their current leather jerkins and caps, along with arm and shin guards to match. leyten insisted on ornamenting the helms with ridges and cuts, as well as cutting the breastplates and guards in toothlike patterns. dalinar's army (1173-)[edit] after the battle of the tower, leyten joined dalinar’s army along with the rest of the bridgemen. he continued working on armor, fixing issues as gear arrived from the quartermaster. he also assisted in guarding the various members of house kholin. in the mornings, leyten trained with natam and a few others. when kaladin gave shen a spear, he encouraged the parshmen to train with leyten and natam, who were willing to teach him. when renarin joined bridge four, leyten helped teach him how to carry a bridge. leyten was one of the bridgemen who was guarding dalinar when rlain surrendered himself to the alethi. he survived the everstorm and the preceding battle. at urithiru, he was among the members of bridge four who accompanied shallan davar when she confronted re-shephir. he was shaken by the event and had nightmares about it for some time. he became a squire to kaladin stormblessed at some point during their training, and so he participated in the running competition that sigzil held to test the benefits of stormlight. he was one of the slowest due to stopping for food during the run. alongside his training, he kept on handling the supply, but as organization of the bridge crews was a mess, he couldn't deal with all the requisition orders. leyten presumably fought in the battle of thaylen field and the preceding battle in defense of urithiru along with the rest of bridge four present. following the battle at thaylen city, leyten bonded a spren of his own. he later went on a mission to akinah with several other windrunners. he reported a strange weather pattern around the island as well as swarms of strange small shadows (later discovered to be hordelings that had bred with larkin) hovering in the clouds, but was unsure if they were alive or were spren. one came from behind and drained him of his stormlight. he subsequently fell in the ocean and had to be rescued by lyn and sigzil. he also accompanies the fourth bridge on its expedition to hearthstone, defending the airship against the fused assault along with a dozen other windrunners. following kaladin's retirement, leyten gathers around fifty windrunners to show respect to their former highmarshal. he and a majority of the bridge four windrunners join dalinar kholin's forces on the battlefield in emul. later, he goes with dalinar on his trip to find ishar, and finds that he and the other four windrunners are no match for ishar's power as ishar tethers all five to the stone with a ""glowing rope that drained the stormlight out."" after ishar flees, dalinar has leyten and the other windrunners search the herald's camp, finding unnatural corpses of spren within the physical realm. the group then returns to emul, unnerved by their experience. leyten later reunited with bridge four to participate in teft's funeral. trivia[edit] - leyten is based on a friend in brandon's writing group named alan.

Natam,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Natam,"natam is a longtime member of bridge four on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] he has a long face. while serving as a bridgeman, he was somber and withdrawn, and rarely spoke. after the liberation of bridge four, he became far more outgoing and jocular. he expresses loyalty to kaladin and his comrades-in-arms. attributes and abilities[edit] natam is presumably skilled with a spear, as he and leyten hold morning practice sessions to train bridge four's new recruits; kaladin suggests that shen train with them. as a windrunner, he is able to breathe in stormlight. this gives him some magical abilities, including healing and the power of flight using basic lashings. history[edit] natam was once a farmer, and he spoke with a rural alethi accent. it is unknown how he came to serve in torol sadeas's bridge crews. natam was present in the early days of kaladin's time in the bridge crews. when kaladin got gaz to assign bridge four stone-gathering duty so they could covertly search for knobweed, he tried to engage with natam, who was putting forth minimal effort. natam did not want to speak to kaladin and seemed ambivalent about the changes that were occurring, and kaladin realized that he needed to give the bridgemen something to live for besides simply surviving. after some time training with kaladin, natam began to see value in his leadership. he was presumably present with the rest of bridge four when kaladin was judged by the stormfather and was subsequently a fixture in bridge four. he became trained with the spear, and was among the bridgemen who served as the honor guard for the kholin family. he and mart were assigned to guard navani on the night that king elhokar nearly fell off his balcony in a suspected assassination attempt. he helped save elhokar, and was the first person to inform kaladin about what had happened. kaladin asked natam more questions about that night while they were training to ride horses with jenet. natam remembered seeing moash on the balcony, which was one of the clues that led kaladin to confront moash about his involvement in the assassination plot. natam presumably participated in the battle of narak and was present in the city after humans captured it from the listeners. he was among the members of bridge four that discussed using their windrunner squire abilities before expressing unease about renarin learning how to read. trivia[edit] - natam is a cameo for a friend of brandon's named nathan goodrich. - in a reddit ama, nathan mentioned that he was in brandon's reading group at byu - and joked that his name had to be changed because ""nathan"" is too symmetrical for a - society. notes[edit]"

Sja-anat,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sja-Anat,"""“of the unmade, sja-anat was most feared by the radiants. they spoke extensively of her ability to corrupt spren, though only ""lesser"" spren-whatever that means. ”-from hessi’s mythica, page 89"" sja-anat is one of the unmade, an ancient and terrible spren of odium. also known as the taker of secrets, sja-anat is one of the sapient unmade, fully self-aware and responsible for her own actions. sja-anat is capable of corrupting spren with odium's investiture. sja-anat has expressed interest in freeing herself from odium's influence entirely and defecting from his forces. appearance and personality[edit] ""“lore suggested leaving a city if the spren there start acting strangely. curiously, sja-anat was often regarded as an individual, when others-like moelach or ashertmarn-were seen as forces. ”-from hessi’s mythica, page 90"" sja-anat takes the form of a woman with waist-length black hair, wearing a sleeveless, flowing tunic with a simple belt at the waist. she can also appear as the shadow of a woman with long, flowing hair and white holes for eyes. other times, she looks human but with the white holes for eyes of the shadow. so far, she has only been shown to be visible in mirrors, and only to the person she wishes to appear to. when human-like, the rest of the reflection is otherwise as normal, but when she fades into her shadowy variant, the rest of the reflection fades away as well. it is noted that sja-anat wants to be a god in her own right. she is very deceptive, able to successfully trick odium and aid the radiants behind odium's back, as well as deceive him on her personal objectives, such as successfully sending an enlightened true spren to mraize by hiding them in a group of enlightened windspren. she is also independent and earnest; she does not want to be odium's servant anymore and desperately wants shallan to believe that she has defected from odium. sja-anat also cares for her children, the spren that she has corrupted, and wants to find them a home, one that she would be able to share. attributes and abilities[edit] ""“keep your eyes open. once sja-anat touches a spren, it acts strange. call attention to anything you see. ”-dalinar's visions"" sja-anat's touch has the ability to corrupt spren that she comes into contact with. sja-anat refers to this process as enlightening. spren affected by sja-anat begin to carry the taint of odium, and in rare cases can even grant abilities associated with odium's power, though the extent of his influence on the affected spren is unknown. corrupted spren take on noticeably different appearances, typically changed in coloration and shape but still strongly connected to their original form. other times the resemblance of an enlightened spren to its previous appearance is much more tenuous, notably in the case of an enlightened mistspren which is changed from appearing as a sparkle of reflected light to a more crystalline form that is structured like a shimmering red snowflake. the lesser spren that sja-anat corrupts are capable of serving as her spies or delivering messages for her. messages sent from sja-anat are spoken by the corrupted spren in sja-anat's voice into the mind of the person to which they are sent. sja-anat refers to the corrupted spren as her children. in the past sja-anat often corrupted lesser spren, but she has now displayed the ability to corrupt true spren, such as spren capable of forming a nahel bond like glys, and the spren of the oathgate. however, she does not usually enlighten true spren without their consent. enlightening has ""dire ramifications"" for existing nahel bonds, so sja-anat usually enlightens unbonded spren. corrupted spren do not appear to be particularly dangerous, so it is unknown what impact odium's influence has on the spren aside from their appearance. they work similarly to uncorrupted spren in fabrials, although they were unaffected by the sibling's suppression fabrial when its effect was inverted. history[edit] ancient history[edit] sja-anat's origin is unknown; thus it is uncertain when she came into being. she was involved in the past desolations, with her corrupted spren serving as spies on mankind. in the past when her corrupted spren were seen in a village, the people often fled their homes. sja-anat herself was the unmade most feared by the radiants. after aharietiam, sja-anat seems to have remained on roshar, although none of her corrupted spren are known to have been sighted since the final desolation. at some point sja-anat corrupted the true spren glys. kholinar[edit] following the arrival of the everstorm and the beginning of the true desolation, sja-anat became active again. she began corrupting spren in and around the area of kholinar. during the siege of kholinar, as a part of a trap for adolin kholin, shallan davar, kaladin, and their spren, sja-anat was forced to touch the spren of the kholinar oathgate to corrupt it. when shallan infiltrated the palace in the guise of a messenger, sja-anat saw her. sja-anat attempted to reach out to shallan and tell her that she was not her enemy while she danced with the cult of moments and when she infiltrated the revel on the oathgate. ""“listen, radiant. listen to my plea. ashertmarn fled on purpose. it is a trap. i was compelled to touch the spren of this device, so it will not function as you wish.”-sja-anat to shallan davar"" during the assault on the kholinar palace, sja-anat spoke to shallan and revealed to her that the oathgate had been corrupted and that she was supposed to kill them if they activated the oathgate. when shallan and her companions decided to activate the oathgate anyway, sja-anat promised that she would try not to kill them, and when the gate was activated they were merely transported to shadesmar. after shallan and her group were transported in shadesmar, sja-anat lied to odium and told him that corrupting the oathgate had had an odd effect and that the radiants had been sent far from the point of transfer. despite this lie, sja-anat believed that odium still did not trust her. shortly afterward, sja-anat sent a corrupted gloryspren to deliver a message to shallan. it explained the lie that sja-anat had told odium, as well as the fact that odium's servants were pursuing them in shadesmar. it also revealed that shallan's deception had worked, and odium believed her to be an elsecaller rather than a lightweaver. at some point the ghostbloods became aware of sja-anat's disloyalty to odium and sent shallan orders to either recruit her to their organization or capture her. trivia[edit] - as with many - , sja-anat's name is derived from that of an ancient real-life deity; in her case, the inspiration is most likely - , a semitic war goddess. notes[edit]"
Tumi,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tumi,"""“i must find my own way, my own bond. ”-tumi"" tumi is a mistspren on roshar, bonded to rlain. he's one of the true spren that have been enlightened and transformed by sja-anat. appearance and personality[edit] ""“our bond will be strong, and you will be wondrous. ”-tumi"" very little is known about tumi's appearance. during the occupation of urithiru, he hid in the gemheart of a cremling, remaining invisible. if he's similar in appearance to the other enlightened mistspren, glys, he likely appears as a red crystal dripping light upwards in the physical realm. to sja-anat's sight, he looks like a glowing, shimmering light, constantly changing shape. he's not hostile to singers the way other spren are, and considers it an honor to bond rlain, even thinking him awe-inspiring. he's interested in exploring new things, even when they're potentially dangerous: he willingly underwent sja-anat's transformation and expressed strong interest in the rhythm of war, wanting to share the news of it with the rest of his siblings. he reveres sja-anat as his mother, and is grateful to her for the opportunity to see the world from a different perspective. he's also supportive of rlain and hopeful about their bond, convinced that it will be something wonderful. he remains comforting to everyone he knows, regardless of their relative power. however, he is also cautious; he hides while in urithiru, and follows rlain for a while before introducing himself. abilities and attributes[edit] tumi can hide from sight of others by entering gemhearts of cremlings; he seems to have some control over the creatures this way, guiding them on a specific path. this allows him to stay hidden from voidspren and fused alike, even those designed to detect radiant activity. at times, his speech pattern is somewhat similar to that of the inkspren, using phrases like ""salvation will be"". nahel bond[edit] tumi is a mistspren, and as such grants rlain the abilities of the order of truthwatchers. however, he was corrupted by sja-anat, changing the properties of the bond. while he should still grant rlain the surge of progression, letting him heal others and grow plants, it's likely rlain's illumination will not function as it would for ordinary truthwatchers. most notably, he grants rlain the ability to see visions of the future, and seems able to induce them, or at least encourage them to appear. like with glys, the visions take form of images made out of what looks like stained glass. history[edit] enlightenment[edit] ""“i will go, mother. to the tower, to this man mraize, as you have promised. ”-tumi to sja-anat"" while the circumstances around tumi's transformation are unknown, it seems he deliberately approached sja-anat to be enlightened. when that happened is unknown; however, a year into the true desolation, sja-anat sent him to urithiru to investigate members of the ghostbloods for a possible bond, due to mraize's efforts -- through shallan -- to get the unmade to cooperate with him. while sja-anat was hesitant to let tumi go, wary of both mraize and odium, tumi insisted on forming a bond and set out. at roughly the same time, renarin, the only other truthwatcher to have bonded an enlightened spren, convinced his father to allow ""corrupted"" surgebinders into the ranks of knights radiant. when glys asked who else would join their ranks, renarin almost immediately suggested rlain, the only singer within bridge four. somehow, glys managed to pass this request on to sja-anat, who in turn sent it onwards to tumi. as such, the mistspren started looking into rlain, examining him as a potential bondmate. bonding rlain[edit] ""“i have watched you and seen your worthiness. speak the words, and do not despair. ”-tumi"" before tumi could form a bond, the fused and their forces invaded urithiru, the knights radiant were rendered unconscious, and rlain was locked up for being an essai, or ""human-lover"". to hide from secretspren, tumi entered the gemheart of one of the cremlings inhabiting the tower, and began following rlain. at some point, rlain noticed it, and grew paranoid about the cremling's presence, suspecting that it was a voidspren trying to spy on him. when the revolt against the fused began in the tower, tumi started following the group closer by, directing his cremling to go after rlain as the singer led his group, including humans, venli's listeners and fused, to escape urithiru. impressed by rlain's actions in bringing the three groups together, tumi chose to bond him, and informed timbre, venli's spren, about it. when rlain asked venli if she'd be willing to lend him one of the reachers following her, she passed on the news: rlain had already been claimed by another spren. it was then that tumi chose to reveal himself. showing rlain a vision of kaladin swearing his fourth ideal and urithiru coming alight, he bestowed the title of bridger of minds onto him and implored him to speak the immortal words and form a bond. rlain did so, becoming a truthwatcher; from then on out, the two could communicate mentally, without speaking out loud. over the course of the following day, tumi learned about rhythm of war, combining honor's and odium's rhythms similarly to how tumi himself combined honor and odium's investiture, and grew interested in sharing news of it with his siblings. he also explained to rlain that he approached him for a bond at renarin's suggestion, though it was rlain's own actions that convinced him it was worthwhile. notes[edit]"
Makabak,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Makabak,"makabak is a region in southwestern roshar occupied by numerous nations that share a common ethnicity and culture. it is named for the former silver kingdom of makabakam and includes most of that kingdom's territory. geography[edit] the region covers the southern center of the rosharan continent. it is framed by mountain ranges to the north, east, and west, and has a long coastline on the southern depths. the region includes the nations of alm, azir, desh, emul, greater hexi, liafor, marat, steen, tashikk, tu fallia, tukar, yezier, and about half of triax. the azish empire includes many of these nations, although it does not encompass the entirety of makabak. makabak has a single oathgate, in the azish capital of azimir. culture[edit] makabaki people generally have dark brown skin, black hair, and dark eyes. the region borders shinovar, but the makabaki do not have the round eyes of the shin. there are approximately thirty makabaki languages, most of which branched off from azish. many of the nations are rich in culture and have thriving trade. the area has higher population density than the nations to the east and azimir is larger than kholinar. residents of several makabaki nations are thought to avoid offending others as much as possible, and would rather dodge a request than deny it, especially if it comes from a foreigner. azish people are considered verbose and sometimes intentionally vague in order to conceal their true intentions. the azish empire has many skilled clerks and scribes, and is thought of as highly lawful, bureaucratic, and organized. the makabaki worship the heralds not the almighty. politics[edit] azir is the largest nation in the region, and its prime aqasix traditionally claims authority as emperor of makabak; in practice, the prime only rules azir. other member states of the azish empire recognize the monarchy and still follow certain traditions in regards to the prime aqasix, but they are actually governed with a high degree of autonomy. even though azir does not actually rule the entire region, it is still highly influential. feuds between nations are thought to be common, although the true nature of the feuds is disputed. emul and tukar are currently at war. the leaders of each nation are sometimes addressed by the name of their nation rather than their proper name. the region is thought of as politically unimportant by residents of other nations; the lack of centralized political power causes many makabak heads of state to be indecisive. the large vorin kingdoms see the makabaki as pagans and sometimes refer to the nations as ""tribes"" and to the people as ""barbarians"". conversely, the azish harbor ill will towards the alethi due to a genocide perpetrated by their former king, sadees the sunmaker. during dalinar kholin's attempts to unite roshar, noura unexpectedly tells him that azir and several other makabaki nations have agreed to meet with him in urithiru. it is likely that some of the makabaki leaders were more receptive to dalinar's offer because the voidbringers invaded the area during the true desolation, conquering portions of emul and marat as they positioned their armies to attack thaylen city. makabaki leaders are seen strategizing with alethi leadership, which is notable because there have not been any formal alliances between the two regions in centuries. dalinar thinks of the azish generals as scribes and is surprised to learn that they have skill in military strategy. notes[edit]"
Ishar's Field,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ishar%27s_Field,"ishar's field is a region or field in central alethkar on roshar, near inkwell. it is presumably named for the herald ishar. it lies along a major trade route between revolar and kholinar. moash traveled the route many times as a child, running caravans with his uncle. he once again followed the route as he hauled a supply sledge for the singers during the siege of kholinar. notes[edit]"
Kalak,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kelek,"""“i am a blur. a smear on the page. a gaunt stretch of ink, made all the more insubstantial with each passing day. ”-kalak"" kalak, also known as kelek'elin in vorinism, is one of the ten heralds of the almighty on roshar, and the patron of the order of willshapers. like all heralds but taln, he abandoned the oathpact at aharietiam. currently, he lives in the honorspren city of lasting integrity, acting as their high judge. he also leads the sons of honor under the name restares. appearance and personality[edit] ""“it's so hard to decide. to do anything really… ”-kelek"" appearance[edit] though not from alethkar, kalak appears alethi. he's a short man, with thinning, wispy hair, a round face, and a small nose. when he wishes to appear serious, he puts on a set of violet robes; ordinarily, however, he dresses more casually. vorin artwork tends to present him as a young man, though in person, he looks more like a city administrator. personality[edit] back in the early desolations, he was known for being decisive and authoritative, and he would often be approached whenever problems appeared for counsel. however, as desolations wore him down, he became terrified of dying and returning to braize to be tortured. by aharietiam, he has vivid, painful memories of the torture that sometimes cause him to briefly lose his grip on reality. when given the choice to abandon the oathpact, he's aware of and terrified of the consequences. however, by this point his fear of torture far outweighs his sense of duty. by the true desolation, this develops into paranoid and erratic behavior. kalak vacillates often, and finds making even the simplest decisions difficult. he often follows what the crowd wants instead of his own internal moral compass. he seems to have trouble focusing, or at least paying attention to time, even when others are waiting for him. he believes humans are dangerous; he's unsettled by their presence, with bondsmiths, and people associated with them, seeming to provoke the strongest reaction. a visit into a human city makes him jittery to the point where he runs away at the sight of another person. it's likely that he prefers to live in lasting integrity for this reason. even there, however, unexpected commotion can quickly make him panic. in this state, he is near-insensate, crying, covering his ears and curling on the floor. he recovers extremely quickly, though, and with no outward sign that he's been disturbed. ""“they deserve better than you, son. they deserve better than me. i could never judge them for refusing to bond men. how could i?”-kalak"" kalak is keenly aware of the fact that he and his fellow heralds are mentally unwell, and does not hide this. he is extremely pessimistic, believing that the cause of roshar is already lost, and feels immense guilt for causing spren to bond with humans, leading them to what he believes to be their doom. the one thing he is still driven and decisive about is his utter obsession with leaving the rosharan system altogether, and though he cannot break free yet, he's done extensive research on other worlds. to facilitate leaving, he aligns himself with gavilar, assisting his research. after gavilar's death, he continues the project of his own, hoping to unmoor himself and leave the entire cycle of desolations behind. kalak can be snarky, and will dryly mock people he considers stupid. he can still exercise some measure of authority, and can make snap decisions when truly needed. when faced with the possibility of his own death, he's calm and composed. for all that he fears humans, he sympathizes with them, and is at the very least willing to hear them out and give them some chance, even if he doesn't believe that they can succeed. he is willing to offer information to those who ask. attributes and abilities[edit] herald[edit] ""“he is not the type to fight unless cornered, but once pushed, there are few beings as dangerous on this planet. ”-mraize"" kalak is a cognitive shadow which can persist after death and take on a human body, which is grown for him through unknown means, fully adult, every time he is reborn. while on roshar, he doesn't age, and can only die by violent means; and after death, he travels to braize, where he is caught by the fused and tortured until he or another herald breaks. when this happens, they are all returned to roshar and a new desolation begins. prior to the last desolation, kalak wielded an honorblade, making him a surgebinder. the blade granted him control over the surges of transportation, allowing him to travel to and from shadesmar, and cohesion, which lets him shape inanimate matter, particularly stone, making it softer and more malleable. additionally, kalak could use stormlight to heal himself. mraize considers him a highly dangerous fighter, especially when cornered. kalak himself is not nearly so confident, and thinks that his inability to decide would make him easy prey, should anyone choose to attack him. scholar[edit] ""“old thaidakar has always wanted my secrets. ”-kalak"" kalak is cosmere-aware. he's researched other worlds to the point where he can draw a star map of them, knows about the existence of ghostbloods, and seems aware of thaidakar's condition. after gavilar kholin's death -- and thus, the end of the king's experiments with transporting spheres -- he apparently continued to search for a way to leave the system. he seems to have made significant progress during that time, as a year into the true desolation, he believes that he is on the cusp of success. the ghostbloods seem to agree, as they wish to steal him away for thaidakar to learn about his state as a cognitive shadow. kalak has some engineering knowledge, as he assists shallan and adolin in opening the box containing ala without killing the seon. he's additionally familiar with metalworking and smithing, as at the start of each desolation, it was his duty to re-teach mankind how to cast bronze for weapons. he knows more than shalash about how the oathpact, and by extension cognitive shadows, function, as he is able to diagnose what went wrong in the voidbringers' attempt to capture jezrien. other[edit] he used to be known for his decision-making skills; even today, the honorspren place him in position of their high judge, likely because of this past association. however, though the honorspren obey his verdict, he does not have much actual power over their leadership. using his mental instability as an excuse, the honorspren can imprison him in his quarters with no apparent consequences, and kalak either cannot or does not wish to resist them. kalak is also restares, the leader of the sons of honor. as such, has the capacity to set up and organize a large group of people; it's unclear how he communicates with them between shadesmar and physical realm. however, with the sons of honor crumbling after the everstorm began, and the last known group answering to ialai, it's likely his influence with them, and the influence they wield, has waned. notably, he seems quite capable of keeping his involvement hidden, as gavilar does not seem to realize that the two are one and the same. history[edit] herald of the almighty[edit] ""“jezrien, i can't return this time. i can’t. ”-kalak"" kalak was born on ashyn, and made the journey to roshar when his home planet was destroyed by the overuse of surges. when a war between humans and the native singers started and the fused began to appear, he, along with nine others, was made a herald by honor. he volunteered; it's unknown how many of the others did the same. during the desolations, his particular speciality was teaching people craftsmanship, mainly smithing bronze. at aharietiam, kalak was late to the appointed meeting place for all the surviving heralds. there, he found only jezrien, awaiting him, uncertain whether or not kalak had perished. when kalak confessed to his fear of returning to braize, as was the heralds' duty in-between the desolations, jezrien told him about ishar's plan to abandon taln to the oathpact. though initially apprehensive, kalak agreed readily enough, out of fear of the tortures. he and jezrien left their honorblades along with the others, and departed in opposite directions. the recreance and the era of solitude[edit] ""“we weren't supposed to get worse. am i getting worse? i think i feel worse. ”-kalak"" it's unknown how kalak spent most of the four and a half thousand years between the last desolation and the true desolation. he appears to have been at least distantly involved with the knights radiant. shortly before the recreance, he and nale were both present for ba-ado-mishram's imprisonment, and he knew the truth of what caused the recreance. at some point afterwards, he grew to regret what happened with the unmade, but he either didn't seek out her gemstone to release her or did not succeed in finding it. many centuries later, kalak apparently became somehow involved with the sons of honor; it's unknown if he founded them or if he took them over. under the name restares, he became the leader of the group, gaining the attention of the ghostbloods. through the sons of honor, kalak met gavilar and encouraged, along with nale, the king's work on transporting spheres across long distances, hoping to find a way out of rosharan system. the two of them were both present at the night of gavilar's assassination, and met with the king to see the results of his work, with kalak complaining about the slow pace of progress. while walking down a palace corridor, kalak expressed his fear for shalash's sanity, as well as the sanity of the remaining heralds, himself included. nale rebuked him, but before the two could discuss it, they bumped into jasnah, and kalak fled from her. after kaladin saved meridas amaram from an attack by helaran davar on a battlefield in alethkar five years after gavilar's assassination, kalak, who was still using the name restares, persuaded amaram to take helaran's shards for himself and brand kaladin a slave. at some point after the assassination, kalak moved to lasting integrity and either assumed or resumed the duties of their high judge. the trial of adolin kholin[edit] the diplomatic mission[edit] ""“boy, you're doomed. you realize that, right? tanavast is dead. like, completely dead. the oathpact is broken somehow. the only thing left is to try to get off the ship before it sinks. ”-kalak to adolin"" following the death of ialai sadeas, mraize gave shallan the mission to track down restares, pointing her towards the city of lasting integrity. shortly after, a diplomatic mission to that very city was proposed, and shallan volunteered to go, with her husband adolin kholin joining as the expedition's leader. meanwhile, kalak left the city for a longer patrol. prior to his departure, he ordered the honorspren not to tell anyone about his identity or nature; as such, they maintained that the high judge was merely a rare type of spren. when kalak returned, adolin approached him, asking for a trial by witness, and for kalak to preside over it. though initially spooked by the presence of a human, and son of a bondsmith to boot, kalak eventually agreed. sekeir attempted to convince him not to give adolin the time of day, but kalak rebuked him, annoyed that despite having spent years in lasting integrity, the honorspren did not help kalak get off-world. however, the herald refused to keep the trial private, and openly admitted to adolin that he did not believe the other man stood any chance of winning. he also suggested that adolin should rather focus on leaving roshar altogether, as winning against odium was, in kalak's opinion, impossible. at the same time, mraize convinced shallan to capture kalak in a gemstone as a way to help adolin succeed in the trial. kalak, aware that someone would be sent to kill him, though unaware of who precisely, composed a message to his killer in the journal, mocking them for thinking they could capture a herald and begging that they release ba-ado-mishram. the trial[edit] ""“so we're arguing over even the definitions? this doesn’t bode well. ”-kalak"" on the first day of the trial, kelek was impatient to begin, fully ready to convict adolin and have him sent to execution; the news that the honorspren wouldn't actually execute adolin came as a surprise to him. after hurrying sekeir along to begin as soon as possible, and making sure he understood the terms of the trial correctly, kelek began to listen to the witness testimonies. after amuna's testimony, kalak admitted that the stormfather choosing to bond again was in adolin's favour. after a longer break, however, when he made everyone wait as he ate a fruit and made notes, he was forced by sekeir to admit that the stormfather's recent erratic behavior made the great spren's opinion untrustworthy. next came blended's testimony; following it, kalak pointed out to adolin that an inkspren electing to side with honorspren on any matter was not a good look for humans. finally, notum was brought out to read a pre-made testimony. however, he broke away from it to protest and side with adolin. this caused a good amount of agitation among the honorspren, which in turn made kalak panic. he curled up and covered his ears, trembling. after notum was led out, kelek quickly returned to a state of calm, and explained to adolin that he's stepped into an old argument between spren. when adolin pointed out that the first day of the trial went well for him, kalak was unconvinced. he explained to adolin that he did not believe men truly changed, and further elaborated that some spren believe they should side with odium, and that adolin's arrival could tip the scales in favour of that. ""“you were warned about this trial multiple times, human. they have made their choice.”-kalak"" on the second day, kelek arrived after adolin, having changed into a more formal set of robes. he was similarly wishing to hurry things up, but seemed to be taking his responsibility more seriously, threatening to have one honorspren removed for breaking the rules and guiding the trial along. as another spren grew far too agitated, kalak had him dragged out of the forum. however, the trial still ended with a loss to adolin as testament was brought up to prove the modern radiants would still kill their spren. assassination attempt[edit] it was this day that convinced shallan to go ahead with her plan of killing kalak. becoming formless, she snuck into kalak's house, fully intending on capturing his soul and throwing her lot with the ghostbloods. however, her veil and radiant alters managed to convince her that she was strong enough to be shallan, and so she changed her decision. at that moment, kalak, possibly having heard shallan talk to herself, entered the room, and asked if shallan was here to kill him. he revealed that he always knew thaidakar wanted him captured, and explained the conflict between the different generations of honorspren: the elders who wanted to keep themselves isolated, and the younger ones who wanted to keep fighting. when shallan offered to exchange information about ghostbloods for helping adolin win the trial, however, kalak was still undecided. before he could consider it further, lusintia, sekeir and other honorpren burst in, accusing shallan of attempting to influence the trial. surprisingly, kalak sided with the lightweaver, saying that she was here to bring him news of the physical realm; a half-truth skipping over the assassination attempt. in response, sekeir declared that kalak had a bout of mental instability and ordered him and shallan locked away. as such, kalak was absent from the final day of the trial. the aftermath[edit] adolin ultimately won the trial, thanks to mayalaran managing to speak in his defense. in the aftermath, kalak decided to assist him and shallan. he aided them in opening the box holding ala without killing the seon inside, and shared more information about the recreance, revealing that prior to ba-ado-mishram's capture, spren did not become deadeyes. he also told shallan about other planets and what he managed to learn about them. relationships[edit] honorspren[edit] ""“hold on; i don't care what you think. ”-kalak to sekeir"" though kalak chose to live in the honorspren capital, their relationship is not friendly. the honorspren respect him and his judgements, calling him the high judge and addressing him as the holy one. however, they are also aware that he is not entirely there, mentally, and are willing to have him arrested against his will if he does not fall in line with what they -- and particularly sekeir -- want. they respect his judgements, but at the same time, they know that with how indecisive he is, the public opinion is what truly shapes the outcome. it's unclear if they'd still follow his decisions if he were to make a choice they did not agree with. in turn, kalak seems incredibly dismissive of his duty as the high judge. he initially arrived at lasting integrity hoping that the honorspren would assist him with getting off-world, and their failure to do so frustrates him. he does, however, have a clear understanding of their internal conflicts and politics, enough so to realize what adolin's trial is truly about. other heralds[edit] ""“the best of us inevitably cracked. ”-kalak"" kalak, like many other heralds, has a deep respect for jezrien, treating him as the unquestionable leader even when he knows jezrien is just as tired of the war as the others are. the idea that jezrien himself might be breaking terrifies him. unlike nale, kalak keeps that respect even thousands of years later, after jezrien has been reduced to a homeless drunk. he is incensed at szeth using jezrien's honorblade, and quickly investigates what happened to jezrien after his passing. though the group decided to never meet again, kalak and nale seem to spend time together prior to the true desolation. both were present for ba-ado-mishram's capture, and centuries later, both were speaking to gavilar together about his research. they were in kholinar palace on the night of the assassination of gavilar, though they don't seem to have witnessed the event itself. in the present times, kalak seems rather scared of going along with nale, while nale bullies him and dismisses his concerns. he considers taln to be the best of them all. at aharietiam, he was ashamed to leave him behind. during the true desolation, he bemoans the fact that even someone like this could break. culture[edit] ""“they see us as divinities. they rely upon us, jezrien. we're all that they have. ”-kalak"" in the era of solitude, kalak is basically unknown by his true name to humans. in iri and rira, he's called kellai, while in vorinism, he is known as kelek, due to a vowel shift in the vorin languages. even further east, in new natanan, kalak is often equated with the stormfather. vorin tradition associates him with the number 8 (kak), the essence of foil, and the attributes of resolute and builder. in the countries following the religion, he's one of the most revered and commonly-prayed-to heralds alongside jezrien, with his name being an extremely common expletive. in addition to his divine attributes, he seems to be also associated with truthfulness. as kelek, kalak features in a number of common rosharan sayings and phrases, such as: the name kaladin is derived from kalak. the glyph for ""eternal"" is also called kalak. whether kalak was named after kalak or the other way around, however, is unknown. trivia[edit] - though his name became ""kelek"" due to linguistic drift, kalak is one of three heralds, alongside - and - , whose original names are symmetrical under - rules. - kalak is one of the only three heralds so far to have a viewpoint in - , the others being shalash and - , as the prelude is written from his perspective. however, unlike the other two, he isn't slated to have his own book. - kalak's portrait used in the chapter arches is called the maker by the - staff. - the - of - are written by kalak. - the official painting of kalak, by - , was included in the hardcover release of - . notes[edit]"
Eighty's War,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Eighty%27s_War,"the eighty's war was a military conflict on roshar between the bordering nations of emul and tukar during the time of the alethi war of reckoning. the war began circa 1167 and lasted until 1174. the conflict arose over the city of sesemalex dar, which is situated on the border between the kingdoms. emul claimed the city as their capital, but the tukari wanted it for themselves. cause[edit] the emuli believed that sesemalex dar was their ancestral homeland and a gift from the heralds, because the city's patterned layout was central to their religion. the city was believed to be one of the dawncities and named by jezrien himself, increasing its religious significance. the tukari were led by their ""god-priest"" tezim, who was described as a ""warlord"" and ""tyrant"". tezim also claimed that he was ""an aspect of the almighty"", and rumors swirled about him. many observers assumed that the war was religious in nature, although the city was also a major port and a center of trade. au-nak believed that the tukari were using religion as a front for their economic aspirations. dalinar had suspicions about tezim and confirmed with the stormfather that he was actually ishar, one of the ten ancient heralds of the almighty. however, when dalinar asked why ishar would attack emul, the stormfather simply said that he was insane and that there was no logic in his actions. he believed that ishar sought his own death, and possibly the death of all humankind. fighting[edit] the war seemed to be well-known across roshar. navani wondered if the true desolation was enough to distract the two nations from fighting. lift believed that sesemalex dar had been a war zone for ""basically a billion years"". although the fighting lasted for years, it was not as intense or destructive as the brief veden civil war. after the parshmen were awakened, emul was attacked by voidbringer armies that were leaving the area of azimir on their way to marat. emul lost control of most of its territory. the emuli leader, vexil the wise, was desperate for assistance, although he still talked about conquering tukar. it is unclear how tezim and the tukari reacted to the true desolation, but it seemed to bring an end to the eighty's war. notes[edit]"
Sesemalex Dar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sesemalex_Dar,"""“yes, it is the capital of the kingdom of emul, and is one of the most ancient cities in the world.”-sigzil"" sesemalex dar is the capital of the kingdom of emul on roshar during the era of solitude. geography[edit] the city of sesemalex dar sits on a stone plain on the west coast of emul. it borders on tukar and is northeast of torriqqam. the design of sesemalex dar is intricate and often said to be spectacular, built in enormous gashes in the ground to protect it from highstorms. each trough has a lip of rock diverting water from flowing into the city and a complex drainage system of cracks to help it weather the storms, as well as stone of a unique composition that helps with the drainage. the pattern of the sesemalex dar is central to the emuli religion. the structure of the city is very similar to yeddaw, and many consider visiting yeddaw to be the closest thing to seeing sesemalex dar itself. history[edit] sesemalex dar was founded at an unknown time. one of the most ancient cities in the world, some believed it to be a dawncity. the emuli made the city their capital at some point, regarding its design as central to their religion. however, the tukari also desired the city for its use as a port, and they were able to use the status of their ruler, tezim, as a justification for attempting to take it. this resulted in the eighty's war, a conflict centered around the city which lasted several years. at the advent of the true desolation, the eighty's war was swallowed up by the conflict with odium's forces. the fused and singers took the southern part of emul, including sesemalex dar. the city was freed from this occupation when the coalition of monarchs successfully regained control of emul in 1175. culture[edit] it is said that the city of sesemalex dar--and the entire kingdom of emul--was named by jezrien himself. some people such as au-nak believe sesemalex dar to be a dawncity. the emuli believe that sesemalex dar is their ancestral homeland given to them by the heralds and often speak of its religious significance. the citizens of sesemalex dar are well known for their marvelous crem pottery, and the city itself is a major waypoint and trade city of the south. due to the wealth of trade in sesemalex dar, the bordering nation of tukar wants the city for its fantastic port; this is the conflict at the root of the eighty's war. as such, the city has been a war zone for a long period of time. notes[edit]"
Surgebinding,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tension,"""“true surges are of both honor and cultivation-cultivation for life, honor to make the surge into natural law. things must fall to the ground, so they created surges to make it happen. ”-raboniel, lecturing venli[fn 1]"" surgebinding is a prime manifestation of investiture on roshar. surgebinders can manipulate ten fundamental forces locally known as surges, with each surgebinder having access to two of the surges with overlap between them, by infusing objects or beings with stormlight. each surgebinder's surges come in a set combination, for example, it is possible to have the surges of progression and illumination or progression and abrasion, but not progression and gravitation. it is often considered one of the most powerful invested arts in the cosmere, so much so that rayse believes that there would be a war when shards of other worlds find out about its power. rosharans will often refer to any invested art as ""surgebinding,"" though most cosmere scholars, like khriss, would not consider such usage to be correct. a few of the surges, such as illumination, are variations on yolish invested arts. prerequisites[edit] becoming a surgebinder[edit] surgebinding is not innate to rosharans, and can be gained in several ways. originally the abilities were only granted to the heralds by the almighty via the honorblades. later, spren mimicked the effects of the honorblades and started giving surges to humans by forming a spiritual bond called the nahel bond with them. humans also had the ability to manipulate the surges on ashyn before the expulsion, but the mode is unknown. the fused also have access to surges, granted to them by odium. the exact surges that someone can manipulate depend on the specific honorblade or nahel bond that individual has, or which brand they belong to. radiants often learn their ""anti-clockwise"" surge first. honorblade[edit] honorblades are the ten shardblades that the almighty originally gave the heralds. each of these blades gives its wielder the ability to manipulate two surges just like the nahel bond, with jezrien's blade giving adhesion and gravitation, etc. they can be wielded by anyone, and they do not require the safeguards the spren do to avoid abusing these powers. honorblades consume far more stormlight than the nahel bond. they also do not grant the additional abilities of the nahel bond. nahel bond[edit] the nahel bond is a symbiotic relationship between humans and spren, through which the human gains surgebinding powers and the spren gains sapience in the physical realm. the spren choose the people they bond with according to the actions and personalities of those people. there are ten types of spren that bond with humans-each granting access to two of the ten surges, with overlap between them-and each of these types are attracted to different attributes in their bondmates. once the bond is established, the spren is pulled into the physical realm, although they retain very little intelligence and memories and act almost like lesser spren until the bond grows stronger. the strengthening of the bond is accomplished by the surgebinder continuing to act in line with the attributes that attracted the spren in the first place, and swearing oaths that are related to those attributes. as the bond grows stronger, the spren regains their sapience, and the effectiveness of stormlight for the surgebinder increases. once the bond is at sufficient strength, the spren can manifest as a shardblade, and the eye color of the surgebinder changes into the color their spren is associated with. if the surgebinder acts in a manner conflicting with their oaths, the bond grows weaker until, eventually, the spren ""breaks"" and is trapped in a cycle of agony after having a significant portion of its consciousness ripped out of it, and their bondmate loses all surgebinding abilities. if the spren ""breaks"" while in shardblade form, it reverts to its basic sword form, and can be temporarily revived by being linked to the heartbeat of a person using it. spren cannot ""unbreak"" on their own, but can be revived if their bondmates take up their oaths again. it is possible, but extremely difficult, for a spren to be healed without its bondmate. a surgebinder dying without betraying oaths is a very traumatic event for a spren, but it does not cause it to be broken. fused[edit] a group of powerful singers known as the fused are able to surgebind; however, they differ from the knights radiant in several ways. as their power is granted by odium, they are powered by voidlight instead of stormlight. there are only nine orders of them, rather than ten, and each has access to only a single surge; adhesion is considered to be ""of honor"" and not accessible to odium. fused are not ordinary singers; they are souls of ancient singers who reincarnate into the bodies of willing, living singers and displace that soul. each group of fused, distinguished by its access to a unique surge, is known as a brand. light[edit] surgebinding uses the lights of roshar as its fuel source. most surgebinders use stormlight as their fuel, though the fused used voidlight. additionally, venli-and likely any regal with a nahel bond-can use both stormlight and voidlight; navani kholin-and likely any bondsmith bonded to the sibling-can use towerlight; and, as a result of the old magic, lift metabolizes food directly into lifelight, but is incapable of drawing in stormlight. surgebinders access the lights simply by breathing them in. while it is possible to draw the stormlight from any source infused with it, including directly from the highstorms themselves, the common practice is to use gemstones that have already been infused by the highstorms. it is possible to fuel surgebinding with other sources of investiture, like biochromatic breath. human bodies are imperfect containers for stormlight, so it leaves the surgebinder's body over time, giving the surgebinder a glowing effect with luminescent white vapor rising from the skin. breathing out accelerates the leaking, but stormlight substitutes for oxygen, so the surgebinder does not need to breathe. the more stormlight the surgebinder holds, the faster it leaks out of the body. if holding a small amount of stormlight, surgebinders are able to breathe in and suppress the glowing effect. while doing this, they are able to talk without puffing out stormlight. in addition to fueling surgebinding, stormlight also greatly increases the physical capabilities of the surgebinder, who gains superhuman strength, speed, endurance, stamina, and healing of both body and soul. surgebinders can survive falling hundreds of feet and walk away, the damage being quickly healed by stormlight. almost any kind of injury can be healed, including bad eyesight, scar tissues, severed limbs, or spiritual damage done by a shardblade. this healing is based upon the cognitive identity of the surgebinder. for example, if a soldier sees the scars on his body as a part of his self, stormlight would not heal the scars. while inside the body, the stormlight produces an intense adrenaline-like effect, urging the surgebinder to action and motion, which may result in recklessness if the surgebinder is not careful. it gives great energy, but when the surgebinder runs out of stormlight, they are left exhausted and feeling deflated, similar to after a pewter drag by a pewterarm. voidlight, on the other hand, causes a feeling of enhanced passion and emotions feel more vibrant. surges[edit] the surges, as well as their names, far predate the knights radiant. surges existed on ashyn prior to humans' arrival on roshar, albeit without being restricted by honor. back then the nahel bond had not yet been discovered and humans could surgebind freely. ishar was the first person that odium tricked into experimenting with surges. after ashyn was destroyed by unrestricted surgebinding and humans fled to roshar, honor started to put limits on the surges, but with honor splintered, at least some of these restrictions are starting to loosen. adhesion[edit] the surge of adhesion can be manipulated to bind things together. the two orders of knights radiant with access to this surge are the bondsmiths and the windrunners. honorspren and windspren can use it, very weakly. this power is of honor alone; it is referred to as ""honor's truest surge"" and is difficult to suppress, with the sibling calling it ""the surge of binding and oaths"". on the other hand, this surge is viewed as lowly among the singers. raboniel referred to adhesion as ""not a true surge"" and no fused has access to this surge. - : this ability creates an extremely powerful temporary bond between two objects. to use this ability, the surgebinder infuses a surface with stormlight, after which any object or person that comes in contact with the surface will be bound to it. full lashing does not necessarily require skin contact; surfaces can be infused by ""spraying"" the stormlight onto them. - most objects would break apart themselves before the bond holding them would. - the duration of this bond is determined by the amount of stormlight infused. the bond ends when the stormlight runs out. radiants cannot use a full lashing to stick their bodies to something else. - someone wearing - is immune to lashings, but any objects that they are touching can be affected. - spren (and likely other highly invested beings) are also immune to full lashings. - the bond also attracts - . - : using the surge of adhesion to manipulate spiritual, rather than purely physical forces, a - can touch another person and forge a spiritual - between them. this allows the bondsmith to temporarily speak the other person's native tongue. - whether the bondsmith must remain physically close to this other person for the ability to be continually used is unknown. it lasts for longer than a few hours, but shorter than a few days. - : the surge can be used for other types of connection as well, with known uses being connecting a radiant to the ground and causing their stormlight to drain into it as if it were their body, seeing the past and the connections of a given person, and even (with the bondsmith honorblade) stealing a nahel bond. - it is unclear if these abilities extend to bondsmiths in general or are inherently related to the herald ishar. gravitation[edit] the surge of gravitation can be manipulated to change the direction and strength of an object's gravitational attraction. the two orders of knights radiant with access to this surge are the windrunners and the skybreakers. the fused brand with access to this surge are the shanay-im, or heavenly ones. - : this ability alters an object's or being's spiritual gravitational bond to the planet below, instead temporarily linking it to a different direction. it allows the surgebinder to run up walls, or send objects or people flying off into the air. lashings only affect gravitational pull and not mass. different things with different masses will still fall at the same speed as mass does not affect rate at which things fall. - lashings can only send something in a particular direction and can not be locked into following an object. - lashing can also affect liquids and gases, but this is difficult. - surgebinders can rotate themselves in the air using wind resistance, - and can also lessen the force of the wind while flying. - taking sharp turns while lashing can cause the surgebinder to black out. - when lashing multiple objects or beings at a time, it is possible to create a sort of channel around the group, which will keep them close together. - basic lashing requires skin contact if the surgebinder is trying to infuse an external object or being. - basic lashing continually consumes the - with which the object is infused until the object runs out of stormlight or the surgebinder dismisses their lashing; as such, the length of a basic lashing is dependent on the amount of stormlight used. - however, it can run out faster if the target uses - to increase their weight. - advanced users of basic lashing can employ partial lashings - a half-lashing upward, for example, would make the surgebinder effectively weightless, while a quarter-lashing would halve the person's weight. - it is also possible to use multiple basic lashings simultaneously so that the infused object or being will be pulled toward different directions at once or pulled toward a single direction but stronger than gravity normally would. - it is possible to only lash part of an object, though this requires skill. - : by combining the surges of gravitation and adhesion, a windrunner can create a bubble around a surface that imitates its spiritual link to the ground beneath it. in effect, this makes the infused object pull other objects towards itself. it is much harder for reverse lashing to affect objects touching the ground, where their link to the planet is the strongest; objects falling or in flight are the easiest to influence. other objects can be affected, but the stormlight and skill required are much more substantial. this ability is believed to be a specialized version of basic lashing. - reverse lashing requires a command and constant skin contact for it to work, though it consumes comparatively little stormlight. - a reverse lashing can be powerful enough to bend the path of bullets, or tear the head of a - from its body. - objects infused with a reverse lashing do not glow with stormlight, becoming darker instead along with other things in their vicinity, possibly by pulling light into the object. division[edit] the surge of division can be manipulated to have power over destruction and decay. the two orders of knights radiant with access to this surge are the dustbringers and the skybreakers. - : using the surge of division, the surgebinder can touch an object and cause it to burn, turn to dust, or decay in other ways. the surgebinder can exercise significant control, such as to burn a pattern into a piece of wood. it can also be used on humans. - this splits the molecular bonds of the object the surge is used on, but not the axi themselves. - it is likely to have the ability to ignite objects. - decay can be used to create types of sculptures, such as adding color when burning objects or grayscaling them. abrasion[edit] the surge of abrasion can be manipulated to alter the frictional force between two surfaces. the two orders of knights radiant with access to this surge are the dustbringers and the edgedancers. the brand of fused with access are the shetel-im, or flowing ones. - : this ability allows the surgebinder to make their body frictionless. the surgebinder can choose which parts of the body are affected and which parts are not; for example, the bottom of the feet can be infused so that the surgebinder glides over any surface without losing momentum until the ability is suspended. - wind friction can also be affected. however, slicking doesn't reduce the force of direct collisions. - people experienced in its use often move as though they were ice-skating on the ground. - slicking can also be used to escape any grasp, or slip through tight openings. - it can also be applied to objects, making it so that only the surgebinder can grip the object without it slipping. - dead shardplate would interfere with this. progression[edit] the surge of progression can be manipulated to alter the growth and healing of organisms. the two orders of knights radiant with access to this surge are the edgedancers and the truthwatchers. the brand of fused with access are the magnified ones. - : this ability accelerates organic growth to tremendous speeds. the surgebinder can infuse the seeds of a plant with stormlight through skin contact, and in seconds, it will become fully developed. it is unknown if this ability only works on plants. - the fused with access to this surge can use it to grow their carapace into tools and weapons. - : this ability heals the damage done to the body and the soul of a person instantly and without any scarring. the flesh, muscle, or bones can be completely regrown rapidly. the body can be refreshed and rid of fatigue. - the surgebinder can even reverse death with regrowth; a body that has bled out or a soul that has been severed with a shardblade can be healed with regrowth and continue to function as if it has never been damaged. - however, once the soul leaves the body and reaches the afterlife, it is impossible for the surgebinder to revive the person. - this ability may also fail to heal injuries that are too old. - regrowth is inferior to normal radiant healing. - surgebinders can stack regrowth with their radiant healing to heal much faster than normal. - - surge fabrial: a surge - is able to mimic the radiant ability of regrowth. ancient radiants possessed fabrials constructed from a large topaz and heliodor that were able to ""regrow"" and repair injuries through manipulating the surge of progression. - in the present day, they have been lost; however, the - - possesses one capable of bringing someone back from the brink of death. illumination[edit] the surge of illumination can be manipulated to create auditory and visual illusions. the two orders of knights radiant with access to this surge are the lightweavers and the truthwatchers. the brand of fused with access are the mavset-im, or masked ones. - : this ability creates visual and auditory illusions. the illusion is based upon not just what the surgebinder imagines, but also desires to create, requiring both a mental picturing of and a spiritual connection to the intended creation. - once the creation is shaped, the surgebinder breathes out a cloud of - to form the illusion. - the illusion can be created anywhere, but requires a constant source of stormlight, so the surgebinder - or a being the surgebinder is spiritually linked to - needs to keep in proximity to it. because the illusion automatically feeds off the surgebinder, the glowing effect common to the surgebinders as the stormlight leaks out of their bodies does not happen, as excess stormlight is instead fed to the illusion. - unless the surgebinder intentionally dissolves the apparition, it will stay active until they run out of stormlight or leaves its proximity. it can even stay active while the surgebinder is unconscious. - attaching a lightweaving to a being they are bonded with will cause their stormlight to drain faster. - it's possible for the surgebinder to attach the illusion to themselves, as well as a being they are spiritually linked to such as the - that forms the - , so that the illusion automatically follows their movements. this way, an illusion of a disguise can mimic facial expressions or adapt to the clothing or the accessories they are wearing. - experienced practitioners of this art can also attach the illusion to an object that is infused with stormlight, such as a - . - the illusory image has no substance to it, and if an object physically passes through the illusion, the image fuzzes to stormlight until the object withdraws. - light itself does not pass through the illusion; if the surgebinder wants to see through it, they must put in viewing holes. the amount of stormlight the illusion requires depends on the complexity of it. - lightweaving can manipulate all forms of electromagnetic radiation, including lasers. - lightweaving would be affected by aphantasia. - - interactions with yolish lightweaving: rosharan lightweaving is much more restrictive than the earlier - , - as it requires a spren and stormlight to function. - yolish lightweaving, however, seems to function imperfectly in the current day, - and its users may need help from rosharan lightweavers to fully craft an illusion. - a yolish lightweaver is able to guide a rosharan lightweaver's power. - gaining rosharan lightweaving allows for some supplemental

transformation can be manipulated to change an object into one of the ten essences. the two orders of knights radiant with access to this surge are the elsecallers and the lightweavers. the brand of fused with access are the fannahn-im, or altered ones. using this surge, surgebinders are able to enter the cogntive realm, but are unable to bring others with them, or return on their own. the surge

transition. the two orders of knights radiant with access to this surge are the elsecallers and the willshapers. using this ability surgebinders are able to briefly look into the cognitive realm, which allows them to see hidden essences of others (such as if a singer is a normal singer, regal, or fused). the brand of fused with access are the nex-im, or husked ones. - : this ability allows the

objects at a molecular level. the two orders of knights radiant with access to this surge are the willshapers and the stonewards. the brand of fused with access are the makay-im, or deepest ones. this allows the user to alter the shape of solid objects, but not human flesh, with surgebinders able to grab matter and stretch it, altering the object as though it was soft clay. cohesion is highly resisted by investiture, and even a small amount of stormlight in an object would prevent it from working. - : this ability manipulates the forces that bind - together. - it is considered a cousin to

from the past via stoneshaping. - though stone tends to be the most difficult to soulcast, it will easily obey through cohesion. - : the fused with this ability, while not shown to be able to mold stone, have instead used it to phase through stone. they can move through other materials, as long as they are solid. tension[edit] also called the surge of soft axial interconnection, the surge of tension can be manipulated to alter the stiffness of an object; for example, taking something flexible and making it rigid. the two orders of knights radiant with access to this surge are the stonewards and the bondsmiths. much like cohesion, tension is highly resisted by investiture. for bondsmiths, the use of this surge is different from the stonewards, as they can couple it with their affinity for connection to repair inanimate objects as a complement to the surge of adhesion. notable surgebinders[edit] knights radiant[edit] knights radiant are an organization of surgebinders with the nahel bond who live by the immortal words. they are comprised of ten different orders, with each order consisting of surgebinders who have access to the same two surges. notes[edit]"
Order of Bondsmiths,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Bondsmiths,"the order of bondsmiths is an order of the knights radiant on roshar. the bondsmiths are surgebinders who use the surges of tension and adhesion, and they are associated with the heliodor polestone. they form a nahel bond with one of three unique spren: the stormfather, the nightwatcher, or the sibling. the exact nature of the nahel bond that bondsmiths share with their specific spren is unclear; it may or may not be similar to that of the other orders of the knights radiant. historically one of the most exalted orders of radiants, the bondsmiths are surgebinders of extraordinary power that were refounded following the recreance by dalinar kholin. philosophy[edit] while each order of radiants contains a variety of personalities within it, those who join the bondsmiths generally subscribe to a philosophy of peace and unity. they seek unity at all scales, from uniting the highprinces in a single kingdom in one purpose, to uniting the kingdoms of the world in the face of the true desolation. this philosophy is reflected in their ideals, which are generally themed around unity. bringing people together is their highest calling and their most important duty as radiants. among the other orders, the role of the bondsmiths serve as the heart and soul of the radiants and makes them some of the most respected and celebrated of the knights, making their protection and safety a paramount concern. ideals of the bondsmiths[edit] the ideals of the knights radiant, also known as the immortal words, are a set of rules by which the radiant lives that grant them increasing power as they are sworn. the first ideal is shared by all of the orders, and is used as a motto for the knights radiant as a whole. each of the order then has an additional four ideals that are unique to that order. the ideals of the order of bondsmiths all focus on uniting people. however, the uniqueness of the bondsmith spren means that each individual's specific ideals may take various forms depending on the spren they are bonding and the situation. only the first three ideals of the bondsmiths are known. the first ideal[edit] ""“life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination. ”-the first ideal of the knights radiant."" the bondsmiths share the first ideal with all other orders of radiants, which serves as the motto of the organization as a whole. the words are broadly interpreted to state the value of life, the importance of strength and service and the importance of the methods by which one accomplishes a task. the second ideal[edit] ""“i will unite instead of divide. i will bring men together. ”-the second ideal of the bondsmiths, as sworn by dalinar kholin."" the second ideal of the bondsmiths reflects the specific focus of the order, seeking to follow the path of honor by bringing together disparate groups and serving as a peacemaker. this ideal is broad, indicating that a bondsmith is to work towards unity in groups at all scales from individuals to kingdoms. the third ideal[edit] ""“i will take responsibility for what i have done. if i must fall, i will rise each time a better man. ”-the third ideal of the bondsmiths, as sworn by dalinar kholin."" the main focus of this ideal is becoming a better person over time. there may be other interpretation of this ideal that have yet to be explored. abilities[edit] ""“no radiant is capable of more than you. yours is the power of connection, of joining men and worlds, minds and souls. your surges are the greatest of all, though they will be impotent if you seek to wield them for mere battle. ”-the stormfather to dalinar."" the bondsmiths have access to tension, the surge of soft axial interconnection, and adhesion, the surge of pressure and vacuum. while this is simply stated, the powers of the bondsmiths are many and varied and may not be easily definable as one surge or another. although they are capable of performing the same mundane abilities they share with their adjacent orders, the powers of the bondsmiths are generally used in very different ways. their ability to manipulate connection gives them great influence over the nature of oaths, bonds, and power. their access to raw levels of investiture is the greatest among the orders of radiants. like most knights radiant, the bondsmiths have squires. generally speaking, powers shared between two orders of radiants may vary somewhat, but each individual knight has powers generally similar to those of another member of their order. however, each bondsmith has abilities and traits unique to the spren they bond. this makes a generalized discussion of the common powers of a bondsmith more complex than other orders. some powers may be associated with the stormfather's bondsmith alone and are only true following the splintering of the shard honor and the subsequent alteration of the stormfather. some abilities may only be functional when used in conjunction with a radiant from another order. others may only be accessible because restrictions imposed on surgebinding by honor have vanished following the shard's death. each bondsmith seems to make use of a different variety of light to fuel their abilities, the stormfather's bondsmith uses stormlight, the sibling's towerlight, and presumably the nightwatcher grants her bondsmith lifelight. it is also worth noting that while bondsmiths may be among the most powerful radiants, at least in terms of access to quantities of raw investiture, they generally speaking are not effective in a combat role. their powers are more subtle but also wider reaching than those of a radiant with different surges. a bondsmith unbound is more dangerous than nightblood. adhesion[edit] ""“and honor's truest surge, the surge of binding and oaths, could still work. ”-the sibling describing the surge of adhesion"" adhesion is a very broadly defined ability for the bondsmiths, allowing for a range of powers that it grants to the bondsmiths to manipulate connection, both in a physical sense as well as in a spiritual sense. as bondsmiths are generally not an order that is combat-oriented, their manipulation of connection is far more relevant to their role as radiants. adhesion grants the bondsmith access to a far greater suite of abilities that are not shared with the windrunners, the other radiants with access to adhesion. using the power often referred to as a full lashing, a bondsmith can will a pool or a spray of light onto an object or surface. all other objects that subsequently touch this area will be bonded to the object, sticking them there together so strongly that most materials would fail themselves before the the lashing would fail. the bond ends when the light runs out. this surge has some limited applications in combat, such as sticking an enemy's boots to the ground to throw them off balance and hinder their movement or sticking their spear to a shield, disarming them. the radiant may use this lashing to stick objects to others, it is unable to adhere something to the radiant making use of the lashing though. this specific power is rarely employed by bondsmiths. ""“i was not certain it could be done. the power of bondsmiths was tempered by honor, for the good of all. ever since the destruction of ashyn.”-the stormfather on dalinar's powers"" the surge of adhesion may also be used to create spiritual connections rather than manipulating forces in the physical realm. using spiritual adhesion a bondsmith may touch another person, will stormlight into them, and forge a connection to that person. this allows the bondsmith to speak that person's native language. the connection is temporary, it fades within a few days unless it is renewed again. whether the surgebinder must remain physically close to this other person for the connection to persist is unknown. spiritual adhesion is not capable of allowing a bondsmith to make use of any other of a person's abilities that are not language-related. the power bears a great similarity to other applications of connection such as duralumin feruchemy on scadrial. once the restrictions placed on surgebinding by honor were lifted following the shard's death, bondsmiths are free to manipulate connection much more directly than they have been able to previously. a knowledgeable bondsmith may be able to use these connections offensively, connecting enemy surgebinders to roshar so that the stormlight believes the planet to be a part of the bodies and is sucked into the ground. it is uncertain if this power was accessible before honor's death. this power leaves the recipient feeling drained afterward, with even stormlight healing unable to lift the headaces that follow. another power that only became available to the bondsmiths in honor's final days is the ability to directly see connections that tie all people to one another and reality. when touching another's forehead, their connections become faintly visible as dozens of minute tiny white lines stretching off into the distance. while a bondsmith can visualize these connections, they are not able to be altered in any useful way. a bondsmith may see more specialized connections as well, such as the connections between the heralds that make up the oathpact. under some circumstances a bondsmith can see flashes of a herald's past by touching them. a knowledgeable bondsmith may directly manipulate more specialized connections to steal something like a nahel bond, the mantle of a champion, strength, breaths, the ability to use allomancy, etc. these were previously forbidden by honor. with enough investiture a bondsmith could attach a shard to something. ""“but you must have connection for a vision. you must have a reason for it. a meaning. it cannot be just anything. ”-the stormfather to dalinar"" another power related to the bondsmiths is the ability to create and view immersive real-seeming visions of events real and imagined. it is uncertain whether this ability is exclusive to the stormfather's bondsmith. for the stormfather's bondsmith this is an ability that progresses with the ideals. initially the bondsmith is brought into the visions each storm without their consent, and the visions may be confusing and difficult to understand at first, acting out their actions inside the visions in real life as well. as time progresses, they later may cease having to act out the visions. while eventually the bondsmith may enter a vision at any point, they may only bring along others who are inside of a highstorm. initially the stormfather may grant a specific set of visions crafted by honor prior to his death to instruct a future bondsmith in the fight against odium. eventually a bondsmith may create their own visions for others to experience. these visions involve forging a connection between a person and something of significance that they are connected to, perhaps something they desire, a hope or a wish, such as when dalinar grants kaladin his vision of tien. the person that experiences the vision may need to be in a highstorm in order for the bondsmith to create the connection for a vision. these visions may occur in an instant, as time slows during the centerbeat of the highstorm. those who see these visions are in some way experiencing the spiritual realm, but the cognitive realm is also involved to provide a framework for what appears and allow for spiritual realm to be comprehensible. any intelligent personalities that exist in the vision are comprised of investiture that has interacted with the cognitive realm in order to come to life and be capable of intelligent response. this power can allow someone to interact with historic figures long dead or speak to deceased loved ones for a moment or two. when these visions show people who have passed into the beyond, it is ambiguous whether these minds are truly allow the dead to speak from the beyond or whether the stormfather's knowledge and connection allows him to convincingly mimic their personalities. a similar ability that the stormfather can grant is riding the storms, in which a person can join him and view the land from the perspective of a highstorm as it passes over the continent of roshar. the person riding the storm with the stormfather may be capable of seeing even more details of the terrain below the highstorm than the stormfather himself. it appears that his bonded radiant may exercise even more control over these visions than a normal person allowed to ride the storm. when his radiant rides the storm, the radiant may control it if the stormfather allows them, and can even go backwards against the force of the storm, although this pains the stormfather greatly. when in this state a bondsmith is even capable of accepting a radiant's oath in the stormfather's stead. they are also capable of communicating with those in the highstorm, though those words will not be spoken out loud via their physical body. the ability of the sibling's bondsmith to see and comprehend the mechanisms of urithiru may be related, it represents a similar expansion of the radiant's perception and knowledge of the tower in a similar way to someone riding the highstorm. it also allows for the radiant to speak through the veins of garnet in the tower, much as the sibling does. tension[edit] the surge of tension can be manipulated by the surgebinder to alter the stiffness of an object, rendering flexible materials rigid. this is a power that has not been explored greatly and it is uncertain how relevant its applications are to the bondsmiths, although used in conjunction with other abilities it is partially responsible for the bondsmith ability to repair inanimate objects. other abilities[edit] ""“are there others, though? spren like you, or the nightwatcher? spren that are shadows of gods? ”-dalinar kholin to the stormfather"" each bondsmith shares a nahel bond with one of three unique spren: the stormfather, the nightwatcher, and the sibling. these spren are all sort of the same type, but obviously have substantial differences between them as well. the sheer power of the various bondsmith spren allows them to violate the normal rules governing the true spren bonded to other orders. the bondsmith spren are more omnipresent and can be located great distances from their radiants while still granting them powers and speaking directly into their minds, as they are much more widely connected than other radiant spren. bondsmiths typically do not have access to a shardblade. it is possible for the stormfather and the nightwatcher to become shardblades, though this is highly implausible. it is also possible to force the essence of their bonded spren into the physical realm in a way that allows them to activate oathgates. this is an uncomfortable and even dangerous thing to do, perhaps risking killing the spren, and has only been observed with the stormfather. however, like typical radiant spren, bondsmith spren are still vulnerable if their bonded radiant betrays their oaths. while bondsmiths do not have access to a blade, there is evidence that they may manifest a suit of shardplate, perhaps comprised of gloryspren, although this is not confirmed. additionally, following the death of honor, the stormfather's bondsmith has the ability to release odium from his confinement if they so choose, as they hold a large remnant of honor's power and authority. as bondsmiths are deeply connected to powerful spren that serve as sources of investiture, unlike other radiants they are capable of pulling through investiture on demand, each spren allowing access to its associated light. they may use this ability to overcharge another radiant with light directly. this process is physically taxing for the bondsmith. however, as most radiants primarily make use of stormlight, this is perhaps most useful for the stormfather's bondsmith, although the other bondsmiths can still generate their respective lights for personal use. it is uncertain how exactly this is done, but it is not necessary for the bondsmith to be holding some light already in order to pull more over into the physical realm. the exact mechanics of this ability are unknown, but it seems most likely that they are pulling it directly from the spiritual realm. another power that has only become available to a bondsmith following honor's demise is the ability to open a full perpendicularity, seemingly an expansion of the ability to generate investiture. this can be opened fully or partially. if the bondsmith's perpendicularity is forcefully closed, they are able to open another. of the three radiants, only the stormfather's and the sibling's bondsmith have been confirmed to be able to summon honor's perpendicularity, which itself is typically mobile. it is uncertain if the nightwatcher's bondsmith can also summon perpendicularities, although the fact that the wielder of the blade of the bondsmiths may also summon a perpendicularity lends credence to the possibility that they may do the same. in a somewhat unique expression of their power, a bondsmith may use their control over both their surges as well as their unique affinity for connection to repair inanimate objects. during this process they may sense and hear the cognitive aspects of certain damaged objects around them. with some combination of physical effort, as well as this power, they can fix the damage completely. it has been suggested that this ability may have restrictions to progression-based healing wherein it is easier to heal those who are recently wounded, before the soul becomes accustomed to the wound. while this ability may seem niche, it is useful for a bondsmith wishing to assist very directly in the repair of cities damaged in battle, allowing the bondsmith to restore historical works of art and buildings to their former state. another power unique to the bondsmiths is their ability to work jointly with other radiants to create effects that neither could manage independently. a bondsmith has a unique interaction with the radiants of each order, and it may even be that the specifics of these joint abilities vary between each bondsmith spren. when a joint power may be used, both radiants feel a tugging or leaping sensation towards one another. these joint powers only appear to be active when the radiants are physically together, although there may be some way around this requirement. it is uncertain where this power comes from, although it may be the resonance of the bondsmiths. - : the stormfather's bondsmith may work in tandem with a lightweaver to create a three-dimensional projection of roshar as it appeared to the stormfather the last time a highstorm passed over the continent. - this map behaves like any other illusion that is created by a lightweaver, its appearance may be altered or enlarged. - it may collapse if the radiant is distracted - or if the illusion is touched, - though it treats touching the bondsmith differently, instead reaching towards them. - : bondsmiths can increase the strength of an elsecalling, making it strong enough to move a large amount of people between planets. history[edit] ancient bondsmiths[edit] the origin of the bondsmiths is less clear than other orders. while the term is generally used to refer to the order of knights radiant, the term bondsmith predates the order, seemingly though still referring to a person with a similar powerset. an ancient bondsmith bound surges and brought the human refugees from ashyn to roshar. following the destruction of that world, honor placed limits on the powers of the bondsmiths. the bondsmith ishar served as founder of the oathpact, and a bondsmith discovered or created the nahel bond. this ancient bondsmith may have been ishar, although it is uncertain what granted him the powers of a bondsmith prior to becoming a herald. historical bondsmiths[edit] the order of radiants known as the bondsmiths was founded by the herald ishar during the cycle of desolations, who also served as the order's patron. the bondsmiths along with the other orders helped in the fight each desolation against the voidbringers. as becoming a bondsmith is contingent on convincing one of only three unique spren to bond with a person, the bondsmiths commonly had no more than three full members, making them the smallest of the orders. additionally, this number varied over the centuries and there have been times where there was only one bondsmith. that is not to say that there were no others who considered themselves to be bondsmiths. bondsmiths could have squires themselves, although this may not have been the norm. additionally, the bondsmiths were surrounded by attendants and protectors, who were generally considered to be members of the order. some even swore bondsmith oaths as well, despite the fact that this would grant them no powers. some considered this to be the purest form of radiance, for the oaths were sworn for the love of the oaths themselves. the bondsmith's focus was generally on unity and peacemaking, presumably during and between desolations. instead of using their powers in an active combat role, they helped resolve disputes between nations and set up functioning governments in regions where none existed. bondsmiths also helped keep the peace between the various orders of radiants, who often clashed and squabbled with one another. recreance[edit] ""“we are uncertain the effects this will have on the parsh. at the very least, it should deny them forms of power. melishi is confident, but naze-daughter-kuzodo warns of unintended side effects. ”-drawer 30-20, fifth emerald"" the bondsmiths persisted following aharietiam, but their post-desolation role is unclear. they likely continued to help in the struggles against the remaining singers. by the time of the false desolation, only one true bondsmith, melishi, existed sworn to the sibling. as a part of the plan to defeat ba-ado-mishram, melishi used his powers to imprison the unmade in a perfect gemstone, and likely assisted with the capture of re-shephir. this action damaged the sibling, leaving them unable to hear the rhythm of the tower and create their own light. the events of the recreance followed shortly thereafter, and the fate of melishi is uncertain, although his bond to the sibling was ended prior to the recreance. it is known however that the order of bondsmiths was disbanded at this point. refounding[edit] no known bondsmiths were sworn for centuries, although the stormfather was given the task in honor's final days of choosing a new bondsmith. it is uncertain how often this happened, but ultimately over the course of the following millenia, the stormfather chose fewer than ten people to show the visions. by 1167 gavilar kholin had begun seeing visions and had developed at least a tentative bond with the stormfather. this bond ended when the king was assassinated by szeth on the orders of the listeners. at some point in the intervening years, his brother dalinar was chosen by the stormfather and by 1173 he had begun receiving visions of his own. at the start of 1174 he swore the first two ideals and formally bonded the stormfather. true desolation[edit] over the next several months dalinar spent his time acting very similarly to historical bondsmiths, uniting a coalition of monarchs against the voidbringer threat, bringing together the vorin monarchs with the azish and their surrounding countries. while there were some challenges to his authority, dalinar managed to successfully coordinate the defense of thaylen city by swearing the third ideal and learning to open honor's perpendicularity and trap nergaoul using his bondsmith abilities. as bondsmith, dalinar was able to speak on honor's behalf and challenge odium to a duel of champions, which he accepted, before fleeing at the end of the battle. dalinar remained the only bonded bondsmith for the following year. this changed in 1175 when the sibling took notice of navani kholin's fabrials and ended their seclusion to speak to her and a few humans as the singers captured urithiru. while initially unwilling to consider another bond with a human, who the sibling found to be untrustworthy, ultimately the sibling chose to bond navani kholin before they could be fully transformed into an unmade by raboniel. using her knowledge of the rhythms and light she was able to summon towerlight to restore the functions of urithiru and repair the damage inflicted on the sibling by the fused's interference. it is uncertain if this bond has fully restored the sibling to their previous self or if the damage caused by the capture of ba-ado-mishram remains. known bondsmiths[edit] - (ancient bondsmith, bonded to the - ) - (bonded to the - ) - (bonded to the sibling) quotes[edit] ""“but as for the bondsmiths, they had members only three, which number was not uncommon for them; nor did they seek to increase this by great bounds, for during the times of madasa, only one of their order was in continual accompaniment of urithiru and its thrones. their spren was understood to be specific, and to persuade them to grow to the magnitude of the other orders was seen as seditious. ”-words of radiance, chapter 16, page 14"" ""“so melishi retired to his tent, and resolved to destroy the voidbringers upon the next day, but that night did present a different stratagem, related to the unique abilities of the bondsmiths; and being hurried, he could make no specific account of his process; it was related to the very nature of the heralds and their divine duties, an attribute the bondsmiths alone could address. ”-words of radiance, chapter 30, page 18"" notes[edit]"
Tukar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tukar,"""“the judgment of the final storm has come to destroy all men, and only his path will lead to deliverance. ”-tezim, god-priest of tukar"" tukar is a kingdom on roshar. it's ruled by god-priest tezim, who is actually the herald ishar in disguise. the people of tukar are called the tukari. geography[edit] tukar lies in south-western roshar, on the coast of the southern depths and the aimian sea, in the geographical region of makabak. it borders emul to the north and marat to the west, both on rivers. the island chain leading from tukar to aimia are possibly under tukari control. the general climate of the country is unknown. it's likely to be hot and dry, much like the rest of makabak. tukar has several settlements, such as torriqqam and khathazan. along the southern depths, there are also the towns of riqu mar and linder mar. icewater, located on one of the islands off the coast, may belong to it. sesemalex dar, the capital of emul, is located on the western border of tukar, and the tukari have laid claim to it for generations. due to their claim of ownership, there is a strong sense of anti-emuli irredentism in the hearts of the people, which has led to many separate conflicts over the city over the centuries. tukar has an area of around 702,000 km2. history[edit] ""“the war between emul and tukar was heating up. granted, everyone was always saying that. but things had changed over the last few years. ”-hauka"" the heraldic epochs[edit] during the silver kingdoms era, tukar was part of makabakam. at some point, makabakam splintered into smaller states, with tukar being one of them. the era of solitude[edit] when the azish empire began to form, tukar might've joined them, although their status within the coalition, if it even is part of the coalition, is confusing. the nations of tukar and emul have been in the state of on-and-off conflict for centuries, with the main point of contention being the city of sesemalex dar. this was done due to a combination of the religious value ascribed to sesemalex dar by both sides, and due to its effectiveness and value as a port city. rise of tezim and the eighty's war[edit] around 1167, ishar rose to power as the god-priest of tukar. as the leader, he began to lead a new conflict against emul for control of sesemalex dar, known as the eighty's war. shortly before the everstorm, in 1173, the fighting grew in ferocity. at the same time, tensions with marat began to rise, leading some to theorize that they may quickly turn their aggression to them instead. the true desolation[edit] when the true desolation began, dalinar kholin sent messages to both emul and tukar, hoping that at least one of them would join his alliance. tukar outright refused, with the god-priest demanding that, as an ""aspect of the almighty"", he should be the one in charge of urithiru and the knights radiant, they quickly refused to submit to his demands. during the desolation, voidspren began appearing in shadesmar in the region equivalent to tukar. nonetheless, by the battle of thaylen field, the country is still considered to be neutral in the conflict. the emuli offensive[edit] they played a major role in the emuli offensive in 1175, fighting against alethi and azish forces and the coalition of monarchs who were attempting to push the occupying fused out of emul.[citation needed] they primarily set up their armies in northeastern tukar, around the drunmu basin.[expand] politics and culture[edit] the people of tukar are typically brown-skinned and have black hair. their clothes have colours similar to azish patterns. the cloth is thicker and coarser then azish clothing. their outfits are also more enveloping then azish clothing and have braided tassels that hang low from the waist. this style is common in the south east of makabak. the tukari wear colored bracelets, dalinar thinks they have religious significance, although he’s uncertain. the tukari are renowned across roshar for their mercenaries, their perfumes and their jewellery. there are many herdsmen in tukar. tukar is most likely named after tuk, the tukari word for the herald talenel. government and religion[edit] tukar is a theocracy, with their current spiritual and political leader, tezim, being alternately titled the god-priest, god-king, and priest-king. unlike other makabaki states, which consider heralds to be gods, the tukari worship the almighty, much like the eastern nations. tezim is likewise revered as a semi-divine figure, and considered an aspect of god. other titles ascribed to him are ""first and last man"", ""herald of heralds"" and ""bearer of the oathpact"". in reality, tezim is the half-mad herald ishar, making those titles somewhat justified. though the average tukari likely don't know his true identity, there are numerous odd rumors swirling about him outside of the country. military[edit] the tukari are highly militaristic. tukar itself has numerous soulcasters, which it has put to good use in eighty's war. it is not known if they have any shardblades or shardplate, though their military is considered highly capable. the tukari soldiers in tezim’s army don’t wear proper uniforms, they are seen wearing hogshide battle leathers with hardened cuirasses painted a dark blue. most of them are armed with spears, though some of them have steel swords. the tukari military is highly mobile with ishar being able summon perpendicularities and hop in and out of shadesmar. international relations[edit] ""“i'd rather have the emuli anyway. their soldiers might be less capable, but they’re also… well, not crazy. ”-navani"" technically, tukar appears to be part of the greater azish empire, and the prime aqasix seems to have the capacity to summon the god-priest to azimir whenever they wish. however, for generations now tukar has been at war with emul, another azish member state, putting the prime's ability to control it in question. the conflict is centered around the city of sesemalex dar, considered holy by both the emuli and the tukari. while the emuli consider it their ancestral homeland, the tukari motivations for the conflict are unknown. in the east, there is some confusion over whether the conflict is purely religious or economical, as sesemalex dar is an excellent port. tukari in general are considered volatile and crazy by the outsiders, with the alethi relieved at not having to ally with them, and szeth speculating that they might suddenly abandon their crusade against emul and go to war with marat. the main way of communicating with them diplomatically is through their scribes, with the god-priest himself rarely, if ever, speaking in person.

Kaladin,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kaladin_Stormblessed,"""“i don't know what i am either. a bridgeman? a surgeon? a soldier? a slave? those are all just labels. inside, i'm me. a very different me than i was a year ago, but i can't worry about that, so i just keep moving and hope my feet take me where i need to go. ”-kaladin to sylphrena"" kaladin, nicknamed kal, renowned as kaladin stormblessed, is a darkeyed windrunner of the knights radiant from alethkar. despite being trained as a surgeon from an early age by his father, his chosen profession is that of a soldier. he is famed as the captain of highprince dalinar kholin's personal guard, a unit known as bridge four, and commander of the bridgemen battalion. kaladin has known adversity and loss throughout his life. he has suffered repeated oppression and betrayal by the lighteyed nobility, including being driven from his home by the citylord of his hometown as a teenager and being sold into slavery by the commander of his army. kaladin has also been unable to save numerous patients, comrades, subordinates, and even his brother tien from death. despite these challenges, or perhaps because of them, kaladin is driven to protect others. utilizing his skills as a surgeon, he attempts to save as many lives as possible. as a soldier, he rescued thousands of soldiers during the battle of the tower, liberated a thousand bridgemen, and defended dalinar kholin and king elhokar kholin from numerous assassins. he has bonded with the honorspren sylphrena, more commonly known as syl. this bond allows him to discover his powers as a surgebinder and destiny as a member of the knights radiant, an order which has been defunct ever since the day of recreance. kaladin, along with dalinar kholin, renarin kholin, and shallan davar, is one of the new founding members of the knights radiant in centuries. their public revelation during the battle of narak serves as the catalyst for the re-founding of the knights radiant. after the re-founding of the knights radiant, kaladin helped the expansion of the knights radiant by taking on bridge four as squires, with most of them eventually becoming knights themselves. appearance and personality[edit] appearance[edit] kaladin is a very tall man, even tall by alethi standards, standing approximately 6'4"" in rosharan feet (nearly seven cosmere standard feet). he is leanly muscular and has multiple scars on his body. he has tan skin and shoulder-length wavy black hair typical of an alethi. he was born with dark brown eyes, though after swearing the third ideal of the windrunners, his eyes turn a pale, glowing blue whenever he summons syl as a shardblade, and for a few hours after he dismisses her. like most rosharans, kaladin's eyes have an epicanthic fold. his face is square and firm with strong lines and a proud chin. he prefers to be clean-shaven but during his time as a slave, he grows a long, scraggly beard. he is branded on his forehead with a sas nahn glyphpair indicating his slavery and a shash glyph meaning ""dangerous"". these brands disappear after kaladin swears the fourth ideal. personality[edit] ""“authority doesn't come from a rank. [it comes] from the men who give it to you. that's the only way to get it. ”-kaladin"" kaladin is a natural leader who inspires belief and confidence in his men. his squad members in amaram's army call him lucky and believe that being in his squad grants them supernatural protection. kaladin also transforms bridge four from a dejected and despondent group with the worst reputation into a highly-motivated and effective fighting force. dalinar kholin remarks that his men are remarkably loyal and think very highly of him. ever since childhood, kaladin has had a strong protective instinct, which only grows once he begins discovering and swearing the immortal words. he uses his medical skills to save people, first as an apprentice surgeon and later as a battlefield medic. as a youth, he joins the army so he can look after his younger brother, tien. as a squadleader in amaram's army, he recruits the youngest members with the least training to his squad so that he can train and protect them as captain of dalinar's personal guard, he protects dalinar and the king from assassins on multiple occasions. kaladin shows a deep sense of loss when those under his protection die and has a tendency toward depression in various forms. by the time he joins bridge four, he has lost so many people that he has fallen into a deep depression. he thinks himself cursed because he always survives when others do not. at his lowest points, kaladin falls into apathetic despair and becomes suicidal. this happened twice, the first during his first few weeks as a bridgeman, where the constant death broke what little will he had left; the second when teft was murdered and his father was thrown off urithiru. he is also prone to seasonal depression, feeling a sense of heavy melancholy during the weeks of the weeping. kaladin is deeply conflicted about killing, finding it philosophically hard to justify and the notion that one must kill in order to protect ironic and paradoxical. although he is a soldier, he has been trained as a surgeon, whose highest calling is to save all lives. additionally, as a member of the order of windrunners, he lives by the ideals of his order, to which protecting life is central. it is further irony that kaladin's powers of killing appear to be at their strongest when he is actively protecting something or someone. this paradox has plagued kaladin and syl, who have both been unable to explain why killing is justified if the protection of life matters. kaladin also displays several classic symptoms of clinical depression and seasonal affective disorder, amplified by the loss and pressures that are forced upon him. he is prone to depressive episodes, particularly during the weeping, in shadesmar, or in prison-places with little to no sunlight. despite the outward confidence he is often able to show, he often feels like a failure, focusing on the many deaths that he feels he could have prevented. during these times, he feels morose and chapters from his point of view describe that he was feeling ""gray"" and morose spiraling farther into depression. kaladin draws a black and white distinction between lighteyes and darkeyes, harboring a deep resentment and distrust for virtually all lighteyes, fueled by the betrayals of people like roshone, amaram, and katarotam. ironically, kaladin himself is noted to have many lighteyed qualities. many characters remark that kaladin has the bearing of a lighteyes-meaning a leader or noble, since the term ""lighteyes"" encompasses these qualities in the alethi language-and others have noted that ""kaladin"" sounds like a lighteyed name, rather than a darkeyed name. further, when kaladin comes into his true power as a knight radiant, he becomes lighteyed. kaladin despises these qualities in himself, because they make him more similar to lighteyes. due to his recent struggles, kaladin shows hostility and resentment, although at times his wit, sarcasm, and intelligence show through. he appears to have got his sense of humor from his mother and is constantly questioning the world around him. he dislikes beards, finding the way that they itch at the corner of his mouth to be annoying. due to this, he tries to shave his own whenever he can. he finds the vorin insistence on gender norms to be ridiculous and doesn't expect anyone to live up to them, questioning why people mocked others, like renarin, for not being the traditional masculine ideal. however, he does seem to still believe in them and the dichotomy they enforce on how one's role in society, he simply doesn't enforce them himself. while kaladin is accepting of gay people such as drehy, he considers them to be unmasculine, and considers drehy's own beliefs in vorin gender norms to be funny considering his sexuality. however, this doesn't lead him to acting in a bigoted manner against gay men, and even apologizes when he winds up insulting them. this can be traced back to how vorin society in general accepts it due to their focus on oaths; mixed with the beliefs in very strict gender norms, which, while kaladin does not fully buy into them, do influence the way he sees the world. these two factors can be seen as shaping his views on homosexuality. attributes and abilities[edit] surgebinding[edit] kaladin has the ability to manipulate the surges of adhesion and gravitation through his nahel bond with the honorspren sylphrena. by breathing in stormlight, he gains superhuman strength, speed, agility, durability, stamina, and healing, as long as he has access to stormlight. while his honorspren is present with him, his movements are enhanced by her, which kaladin describes as ""being guided by the wind."" this gives kaladin a superior natural fighting talent, although it does not replace skill by itself. kaladin often refers to his powers as the three lashings. the full lashing is sticking objects together with adhesion. it is the first of the three lashings kaladin mastered, as it is the easiest to perform. he can use this lashing to bond rocks to a sheer chasm wall and create a ladder, and similarly to use brushes as portable handholds for climbing. he also uses the full lashing to disarm his opponents by yanking their weapons with his own and neutralize them by bonding them to surfaces while sparring. full lashings cannot affect a radiant's skin, but they can affect hair and clothing. basic lashings involve manipulating gravitation to make an object or person fall in a different direction. after his encounter with the assassin in white, kaladin manages to duplicate the ability to perform basic lashings. he has since learned how to perform multiple lashings on a single object, as well as partial lashings. he is able to fly by lashing himself into the air, and has gotten quite good at instinctively dismissing and renewing lashings in different directions to achieve complex maneuvers such as looping and banking. he can also use this ability to transport people over long distances by lashing both themselves and himself multiple times in a direction. he typically does this while over the highstorm so as to avoid running out of light. the reverse lashing is the most intent-centered lashing of the three, and as such is generally more difficult to use. it involves infusing an object and commanding it to attract a specific other object. kaladin unconsciously performs this lashing during the bridge runs for the entirety of his time as a bridgeman, infusing the bridge he carries to attract the parshendi arrows being shot at him while approaching the target plateaus. later at the battle of the tower, he infuses the shield he is carrying to draw an entire volley of arrows shot at bridge four. he also uses this lashing to rip the pursuer's head from his body. in addition to the lashings, kaladin is able to use his surges to create a pocket of calm within a highstorm. this manifests as a barrier of windspren. resonance[edit] as a knight radiant who has access to two surges he also has a resonance. windrunners, such as kaladin, have an increased number of squires, more than any other order. the squires are also more powerful than those of the other orders. shardwielding[edit] after kaladin swore the third ideal of the windrunners, sylphrena gained the ability to become a shardblade. kaladin can summon her in the form of any weapon he chooses, as well as a shield, and transform it from one to another almost instantaneously. his preferred weapon for fighting is a spear, but he usually summons syl in her default blade shape when showing her off. later, the fourth ideal allows him to additionally summon windspren and manifest them in the physical realm as shardplate. his plate glows blue at the seams, and is emblazoned with the glyph of bridge four on the chest. the spren that can create it are always present nearby, though not always manifest; this allows kaladin to summon it at a moment's notice. he can also send it out to manifest on other people and protect them this way. combat skills[edit] during his time in amaram's army, kaladin's natural talent blossomed him into a master at spear-fighting. he was the quickest learner among the members of his cohort. his effortless ability surprised his drill sergeant, tukks. kaladin spent the year after his brother's death driving himself to exhaustion each day at the practice yard. he eventually grew to be known as the best spearman in amaram's army. he was able to take down six spearmen by himself in seconds even before he discovered his abilities as a surgebinder. combined with stormlight, he held off dozens of parshendi almost single-handedly. while the spear is his preferred weapon, kaladin has training with other weapons as well. he often carries throwing knives as a secondary weapon and is able to use them with considerable accuracy. he has at various times wielded a quarterstaff, a hammer, and a halberd. after becoming the kholin bodyguard, he started training with the swordmaster zahel, though he is by no means an expert with a sword yet. syl has also confirmed that kaladin's preternatural skill with weapons, evident since the first time he picked up a quarterstaff as a boy, comes from their bond. kaladin also possesses a capable mind as a military commander. he became the youngest squadleader in amaram's army when he was eighteen years old. he managed to reduce the casualty rate of his squad to the lowest in the entire army. he was able to train bridge four with barely any resources. he is able to quickly analyze a battlefield and assess the tactical situation. medicine[edit] kaladin started training in medicine with his father and assisting him in surgery when he was eight years old. his training was mostly concentrated in, but not limited to, surgery. after joining the army, he had considerable practice as a field medic, attending to his fellows soldiers injured in combat. he has some level of understanding of pharmacology, as he is able to harvest and extract his own antiseptic from knobweed sap. he also has a basic grasp of neurological disorders like epilepsy. social status[edit] kaladin has had a varied social standing throughout his life. his birth to lirin, a darkeyed surgeon of the second nahn, set him at second nahn originally. when he was branded a slave by amaram, his rank changed to tenth nahn, like all slaves. when dalinar rescued him and made him captain of the kholin guard, his nahn was uncertain, since captain was a rank usually given only to lower-dahn lighteyes. during this time, he was treated as an oddity outside of the normal caste system by many. once kaladin began summoning syl as a shardblade, his eyes would temporarily change to blue, making him a lighteyes, before fading back to brown, making him darkeyed again. dalinar decided that his status as a shardbearer made him a lighteyes of the fourth dahn, regardless of his current eye color. since fourth dahn is a landed title, elhokar gave kaladin a small piece of the eastern crownlands to rule over. this technically makes kaladin a landed lord, despite him not actually having any control over his territory, as it was taken over by voidbringers shortly before he obtained it. as bridge four grew into the refounded order of windrunners, kaladin was promoted from captain to highmarshal. shortly before the fused occupation of urithiru, kaladin stepped down, at dalinar's request, and became a surgeon. his notoriety as stormblessed and the high social status of radiants made his effective status remain high, even if he was technically just a surgeon. he was reinstated briefly as highmarshal during the occupation, although he renounces command again upon the retaking of the tower. history[edit] early life (1153-1168)[edit] early childhood[edit] kaladin was born in late 1153 to lirin and hesina, a family of second nahn, in the town of hearthstone in torol sadeas' princedom in northwestern alethkar. his younger brother, tien was born two years later. growing up, kaladin preferred the shorter name kal to his full name, which he felt sounded like a lighteyes’s name. at the age of eight, kal began training with his father in surgery, though he dreamed of becoming a soldier. at first, he became sick at the sight of wounds and injuries. over the next couple of years, he grew used to the sight and assisted his father during surgeries which he figured would come in handy on the battlefield. however, the amount of time lirin spent with books and sick people, coupled with their class disparity, made people uncomfortable to be around lirin and kal, by association. as a result of his isolated upbringing, kal became very close with his brother and, at the encouragement of his parents, laral wistiow, the daughter of the citylord. surgeon or soldier[edit] in 1164, kal assisted his father in amputating one of the fingers of a fifteen-year old girl named sani. once finished, lirin asked kal why he was late. kal admitted it was because he went with tien to see what jam, a boy two years older, had learned from his quarterstaff training. kal was excited because jam’s father was a soldier in brightlord amaram’s army. lirin replied that he knew jam’s father, having operated on his leg three times, a “gift” from his time as a soldier. kal argued they needed soldiers, but lirin claimed they needed surgeons more. lirin doubted that his son could actually hurt someone as he cried nearly every time someone was brought to them. kal promised he would get stronger causing lirin to ask who put these ideas in his head. kal countered that it was about honor and that no one told stories about surgeons. lirin told him there were two kinds of people in the world, those who save lives and those who take lives, that one couldn’t protect by killing. lirin then informed kal that once he turned sixteen, he wanted to send kaladin to train with real surgeons in kharbranth. lirin told kal he had a gift from the heralds and he didn’t need to waste it on the small dreams of other men. two years later, kal and laral were talking somewhere east of hearthstone while tien gathered rocks nearby. kal told her of his father’s plans to send him to kharbranth to train to become a surgeon. hurt, laral asked why he hadn’t told her. he lied, saying he didn’t think his father was serious. laral wondered about his previous plans to be a soldier. his expression became gloomy as he was conflicted on which path to choose, surgeon or soldier. sensing his distress, tien ran up to kal with a rock that he found, giving it to kal to make him feel better. kal did feel better and went with tien to find a lurg. laral rejoined them, commenting that tien changed kal for the better. laral continued to encourage kal to become a soldier, and that he shouldn't let his father force him to do something he didn't want to. she even implied he could marry her if he won a shardblade. kal replied he still had time to decide as they wouldn't take him until he was sixteen. later, they encountered a group of older boys, one of whom made the claim his father won a shardblade in the wastescum skirmishes. at laral’s prompting, kal contradicted him, which led to the boy, jost, challenging kal to a quarterstaff fight. although it was his first time holding a weapon, his natural talent for combat manifested. however, seeing that he hurt jost, he stopped himself from fighting anymore. jost, having no similar inhibition, beat kal to the ground. kal then asked jost to teach him, but the older boy declined, telling kal to “go be what you are.” joined by tien, kal made his way home, where lirin informed kal that citylord wistiow had died and bequeathed a goblet full of spheres to kal so he could study in kharbranth. two months later, thirteen-year-old kal attempted to treat a five-year-old girl named miasal on his own. kal started treating her, but it was too late as miasal died from blood loss due to multiple severe wounds. an hour later, his father found kal in front of the surgery room crying to himself. lirin told him that he was proud of kal’s work and there was nothing he could have done to stop miasal’s death. kal confessed to lirin that he doesn’t want to be a surgeon, but lirin just answered that he would have to learn when to care. ""“you have to learn when to care, son. and when to let go.”-lirin to kal after miasal's death"" near the end of 1166, kal was walking through the city of hearthstone when he overheard two women claiming that his father stole the spheres from citylord wistiow upon his death. gritting his teeth and knowing that was his father, kal stepped out of the alleyway and gave one of the women a sharp look, causing both to flee inside the bakery. his satisfaction was short-lived as he didn’t understand why people said such things about his father. he was still stewing when he turned a few corners, walking to where his mother stood on a stepladder. when hesina asked about his lessons, he blurted out that everyone hated his father and that they believed he stole the spheres from wistiow. he also lamented that he didn’t have friends and asked what would happen if he wanted to become something other than a surgeon. hesina reminded him that he had tien and that he shouldn’t be so quick to discard his studies because he wanted to be like the others. she also told him not to hate the townspeople as they were just repeating what they had heard. seeing her glance to the citylord’s manor, kal debated whether or not he should try to see laral again. each time he had tried, he’d been turned away by her nurse. he wondered what it would be like marrying laral and if he did, would he always feel inferior to her. he was still considering this fact and debating whether or not to be a surgeon or a soldier when lirin ran in declaring the new citylord had arrived. desperate times[edit] kal went with his parents to the town square to await the arrival of citylord roshone. tien was already there, having already picked out a spot. as tien ran by, some older boys made an unintelligible remark about him which made kal furious, wanting to confront them, but knowing it wasn’t a good time. kal joined tien to view the procession of a dozen wagons and a carriage. the carriage stopped and a middle-aged man stepped out. the lighteyed man scanned the crowd with a distasteful look on his face before turning to climb back into his carriage without addressing the crowd. before he could, lirin called out, trying to welcome him to hearthstone, introducing himself as the town’s surgeon. roshone responded by blaming lirin as the reason he ended up in “this pitiful miserable quarter of the kingdom.” citylord roshone’s arrival brought great misfortune to kal’s family. believing that lirin had stolen the spheres from wistiow, he coerced the townspeople to stop making donations for lirin’s work, which was the primary source of the family’s income. while the townsfolk acquiesced, they still secretly provided provisions to lirin and hesina. one night while drunk, lirin told his son not to make the same mistakes he did and get sucked back into this tiny, foolish town. kal argued that lirin had always told him to come back, but lirin admitted he’d been an idiot when he said that, adding that the townspeople didn’t want him there. kal asked him why they couldn’t just spend the spheres, but his father said the spheres were for his education. besides, if they did spend them, they would be doing exactly what roshone wanted them to do. instead, they did the best with what they had with kal continuing his studies, hesina taking on random jobs, and tien apprenticing with ral, a carpenter in town. at the same time, kal was secretly still trying to decide what path he would take in the next several months, that of a surgeon or a spearman. a series of thumps interrupted kal’s thoughts, sending him scrambling out of his chair. his father pulled open the door revealing not a monster, but three masked men demanding the spheres. however, they weren’t the highwaymen as kaladin initially thought, but rather luten, horl, and balsas, normal townsmen presumably hired by roshone. ashamed and caught off guard, the men left without taking anything. ""“if you’re going to confront him, then you should have someone to support you.”-kal to his father before dinner with roshone"" half a year later, roshone invited lirin to the mansion for dinner. although lirin and hesina tried to hide the meeting from him, kal found out and attended, wanting to support his father if he confronted the citylord. as they rode through the city, kal asked his father why they tried to hide the meeting. lirin admitted that he wasn’t sure if he even wanted to attend as a part of him just wanted to take the family and flee to kharbranth or another alethi town. lirin confessed that he had tried to leave once, but there was a tie between a man’s heart and his home and he couldn’t bring himself to leave. having cared for the townspeople for so long, he couldn’t leave them in the hands of roshone. once they arrived, the pair were led to a dining room where roshone was already eating. a servant gestured to a side table set up in a room off the main dining hall, but lirin sat down at roshone’s table insisting that he was of second nahn and surely he could have a place at his table. not wasting any time, roshone discussed their present situation and asked them to return the spheres, ending their defiance. when kal responded with an outburst, lirin sent him away to the kitchens. there, roshone’s son, rillir walked in with laral, and confusing kaladin for a servant, ordered him to fetch their supper. kal, protesting that he wasn’t a servant, lost an argument over his calling with rillir, leaving him humiliated. as lirin and kal left the mansion, the latter admitted to his father that he had been considering joining the army. however, he had resolved to becoming a surgeon so that he would have the education to stand up to the lighteyes. during their conversation, kal saw something unfamiliar in his father’s eyes, guilt. he then realized that lirin had indeed stolen the spheres from wistiow, changing everything, but also changing nothing. he resolved to use the spheres for his training, but would eventually pay them back to laral. somebody has to start[edit] ""“somebody has to start. somebody has to step forward and do what is right, because it is right. if nobody starts, then others cannot follow...because, son. we have to be better than they are. ”-lirin to kaladin"" while on a hunting trip, roshone and rillir were seriously injured by a whitespine and brought to lirin’s surgery room. kaladin and lirin determined that rillir’s injuries were already fatal and tended to roshone despite his protests. they anesthetized both patients, roshone for surgery and rillir for mercy. during the procedure, lirin hesitated when he discovered a piece of the whitespine’s tusk near roshone’s femoral artery. kaladin considered how easy it would be to fake an accident, but they continued on to save roshone’s life as rillir died. when kaladin asked his father why he did not let roshone die, lirin answered that they have to be better men than the lighteyes. a decision made[edit] in the weeping of 1168, kaladin found himself increasingly hoping for the sun and the wind again, the weather making it difficult for him to get things done. one day, when kaladin was lying on the roof during the rain after repairing a leak, tien called up to him, wanting to join him. while kaladin didn’t think anyone else could cheer him up, he knew tien could because somehow he just always knew the right thing to do. at first, it was just the two of them sitting in silence. then, tien presented kaladin with a gift, an intricately carved horse that he made at ral’s shop. kaladin asked if he showed the beautiful horse to ral, but tien confessed that it got him into trouble because it wasn’t useful. not a bit discouraged, tien said he would make him proud tomorrow by finishing a chair. kaladin found himself amazed at his brother’s ability to smile even in the darkest of times, swearing things grew brighter around them in that moment. however, it was short-lived as kaladin admitted his concerns about their father having to spend the spheres to not only tien, but also his mother. hesina promised him that there would be enough spheres for him to go to kharbranth in two months. kaladin suggested that perhaps the entire family should come with him, not wanting to leave them behind, especially with roshone “strangling” them. hesina informed kaladin that they only spent the spheres to make roshone think he was winning, not because they needed to. once kaladin left, the spheres would be safe in the hands of the ardents while he studied to become a surgeon. however, hesina reminded him that that his life was his own and that he didn’t have to become a surgeon to make them proud. they sat for awhile, kaladin considering her words and what tien could possibly like about the rain, when lirin came with news that there was a gathering in the square. ""“in four years, i will bring him home safely. i promise it by the storms and the almighty's tenth name itself. i will bring him back.”-kaladin's promise to his parents"" roshone assembled the townsfolk as meridas amaram, a general for highprince sadeas, had arrived in hearthstone to recruit soldiers for the army. there, kaladin and his family were shocked to learn that laral was now engaged to roshone himself after rillir’s death. meanwhile, since only six men had volunteered, amaram asked roshone to announce the list of conscripts. as citylord, roshone was barred from from placing lirin or kaladin on the conscription list because they served a vital function to the town. however, roshone placed tien’s name on the list instead. when kaladin tried to take his brother’s place, he was denied because the law gave the choice to roshone alone. left with no other option, kaladin enlisted in the army in order to protect tien and promised his devastated parents that he would bring tien back safely in four years. amaram also promised lirin that he would make tien a messenger boy for a while. amaram's army (1168-1172)[edit] natural talent[edit] kaladin received his initial training under tukks, who taught him the importance of controlled passion-to be passionate and to care without losing control of his emotions-a lesson that he did not initially understand. during his training, kaladin demonstrated a natural aptitude for being a soldier, learning the spear faster than anyone else in his cohort, barely even needing instruction, much to tukks’ surprise. after freezing on the battle field the first time, kaladin was assigned cleaning duty by tukks. not to punish him, but to help him fit in more. tukks explained about how many soldiers struggle with the need to hurt the enemy. however, kaladin didn't believe he froze because he was afraid to hurt someone, but because he realized he could kill, if needed. ""“it’s good to care when you fight, so long as you don’t let it consume you. don’t try to stop yourself from feeling. you’ll hate who you become. ”-tukks to kaladin on his first day of training"" tien's death[edit] ""“don't worry. i'll bring you home. i'll protect you, tien. i'll bring you back...”-kaladin weeping over tien's body"" despite amaram’s promise to lirin, the older messenger boys, including tien, were soon organized into several squads of reserve units to make up for a shortfall in recruitment. dalar assured kaladin that these squads would not see combat unless the army was in serious danger. less than four months after his enlistment, kaladin took part in his third real battle. amaram’s army was attempting to hold a hilltop, but as the battle deteriorated, messenger boys were assigned to sheler's company. hearing that the messenger squad was sent to the front, kaladin ran recklessly through the battlefield in an attempt to reach his brother. on the southeast side of the hill, squadleader varth placed tien and two other boys in the front lines, successfully using them as bait. kaladin, killing a man for the first time during his run, reached tien only after he had been killed. weeping and bleeding from wounds taken during his run, he hugged tien’s dead body until long past the end of the battle. stormblessed[edit] kaladin sent a letter to his parents informing them of tien’s death and his decision not to return to hearthstone. he spent the next year driving himself to exhaustion every day on the practice yard, vowing vengeance and never letting another person die because of his lack of skill. he became the best spearman in his company and was rumored to be the best in the entire army. he eventually met tarah, the daughter of an assistant quartermaster, who coaxed kaladin out of his single-mindedness, claiming it would burn him out. the two became romantically involved, but they separated soon after she was transferred to a scribe’s job in mourn’s vault. kaladin blamed himself for their failed relationship, knowing that he’d been stupid not to send responses to her letters. he later joined the takers under tukks' leadership. there, kaladin met durk, who became a mentor to him. durk was impressed with kaladin’s abilities, considering him a natural born soldier, an artist with a spear. unfortunately, every member of the takers was eventually killed with kaladin being the lone survivor. at the age of eighteen, kaladin was promoted to squadleader, making him the youngest one in the army and became known as kaladin stormblessed. fighting the shardbearer[edit] one year after becoming a squadleader, in ishi 1172, kaladin fought his final battle in amaram’s army. prior to the battle, kaladin met with a squadleader gare and two of his sergeants. kaladin bribed gare to transfer cenn, a young and inexperienced soldier, to kaladin’s own squad, whom he entrusted to his sergeant dallet. he also bribed the surgeons to give priority to his men. while bribing the surgeons, the money pouch stuck to his hand by what kaladin assumed to be a windspren, although it was actually his first meeting with sylphrena. after consulting with dallet, kaladin went to the front lines to prepare for battle. once the signal to march was given, kaladin’s well-disciplined squad used non-standard tactics to avoid taking any casualties. however, the larger battle didn’t go nearly as well. when the larger body of amaram’s forces broke, kaladin’s squad was left in the middle of the enemy. during the chaos, kaladin single-handedly defeated six men to save cenn, who had been stranded alone without the rest of the squad. after treating cenn, kaladin saw an enemy battalionlord and decided to kill him, hoping such a feat would get him transferred to the shattered plains, where kaladin believed the real fight and honorable men can be found. kaladin and two of his subsquads executed their plan flawlessly, with kaladin himself landing the killing blow on the enemy battalionlord. immediately after, an unknown enemy, a full shardbearer, later revealed to be helaran davar, appeared and cut through amaram’s army, killing cenn, dallet, and two more of kaladin's men. helaran continued on to attack amaram, whose honor guard had abandoned him. enraged, kaladin and his twenty remaining men chased after helaran. helaran killed sixteen of kaladin’s men before kaladin finally managed to kill him, saving amaram’s life. amaram and coreb, one of kaladin's men, urged kaladin to claim helaran’s shards, as it was his right to do so by ancient tradition. however, kaladin was disgusted by the thought of wielding the same blade that claimed the lives of so many of his friends. instead, kaladin gave the shards to coreb and walked away. betrayal[edit] ""“it’s not about alethkar! it’s about you! storm it, you’re supposed to be better than the others! ”-kaladin to amaram."" a few hours later, kaladin was called to amaram’s warcenter, where he met amaram and a group of his men along with the four surviving members of his squad. after a short conversation, amaram and his men ambushed kaladin, killing the surviving members of kaladin’s squad while kaladin himself was restrained. amaram apologized but said this was the only way to ensure secrecy. he informed kaladin that he had thought it over for hours before finally being convinced by restares that the best interests of alethkar would served if he wielded the shards himself. as an act of mercy and gratitude, amaram spared kaladin’s life and branded him with the “sas nahn” glyphpair to mark him as a slave to be sold. slavery (1172-1173)[edit] defiance[edit] kaladin spent the next eight months under at least six different slavemasters, including a man named katarotam, suffering from constant and squalid conditions. initially, kaladin was defiant, making ten escape attempts. although several of them were successful, he always ended up getting re-captured. in his tenth escape attempt, he led a group of twenty armed slaves, including a man named goshel. however, they all died, leaving kaladin to believe he failed them. by the eighth month, kaladin fell into despair and stopped making any escape attempts. though he should have been killed for his tenth escape attempt, kaladin’s master found him “intriguing,” and branded his forehead with the shash glyph, meaning “dangerous”, and sold him. eventually, kaladin was bought by tvlakv and it was during this time that kaladin hit his lowest point. he found and hid away some poisonous blackbane leaves, unsure of whether or not he wanted to use them to commit suicide, kill his master, or something else. regardless, he took comfort in having options open to him. however, when a fellow slave took ill, kaladin’s instinct to protect and heal re-emerged and kaladin attempted to save his life. his attempts failed as tvlakv had the slave killed in order to avoid the infection spreading. sylphrena[edit] it was during this time that kaladin first noticed sylphrena. though she’d been following him for several months, kaladin believed her to be nothing more than the average, albeit mischievous windspren. as kaladin was rubbing the blackbane leaves between his fingers, syl asked him what he had. at first, he ignored her, but not without noticing some oddities about her, such as the exceptionally long period of time that she had been following him. when she called him by name, he was shocked as he didn’t believe that spren could use people’s names. to his knowledge, spren could mimic voices or expressions, but they didn’t have actual intelligence or memory. kaladin thought he was insane at first, but he eventually started to converse with syl. during the course of their first conversation, syl asked kaladin why he didn’t fight like he used to. kaladin continued to question how she knew both his name and what he did weeks ago. he finally confessed to her that he had failed, remembering the deaths of tien, cenn, dallet, tukks, and the takers. after the slave took ill and tvlakv had him killed, syl asked kaladin why he didn’t cry. kaladin replied that it wouldn’t change anything and maybe she should ask the almighty why men cry. during a storm, syl chased after it, but eventually returned. kaladin wondered why she didn’t go with the other windspren, but she told him she liked it there with him. finding the way after all[edit] days passed and the wagons continued to roll on until one particular day when they didn’t stop at their usual time, leaving kaladin to wonder why they hadn’t stopped for their afternoon slop. well past noon, they finally rolled to a stop and bluth and tag joined tvlakv. the three quickly started arguing as they held up a piece of paper. kaladin called out, asking tvlakv if he was lost and offered that perhaps he should seek guidance from the almighty who had a “fondness” for slavers. tvlakv walked over and asked kaladin if he knew anything of the area. kaladin requested the map and without even reading it, he ripped it into pieces, much to tvlakv’s horror. tvlakv called for the mercenaries, but both bluth and tag declined to intervene. realizing that kaladin was probably invaluable at that point, tvlakv asked what the former wanted in exchange for guiding the caravan. kaladin suggested a cliff, not for a vantage point as tvlakv assumed, but one to throw the slaver off of. annoyed, tvlakv told kaladin it was good that he was fueled by hatred because it would make him strong, but cautioned that it could keep him from getting vengeance. kaladin countered, saying he didn’t want vengeance as he learned a long time ago it didn’t work. tvlakv argued that kaladin was young still and that he could escape his fate and hunt down the man who sold him into slavery, highlord amaram. shocked, kaladin asked how tvlakv knew about amaram, but the slaver just said men talk. though tvlakv knew the truth about kaladin’s brands, he told the younger man that they both had to play the game for now to avoid an even worse fate. however, they were at crossroads because kaladin had left the map in shreds. kaladin admitted he had never been this way so he didn’t know where to go. as tvlakv walked away, kaladin cursed, realizing he almost found himself liking the slaver. the wagons continued to roll on after their exchange, even through highstorms. well before the end of one of them, bluth lowered the sides of the wagon, allowing the rain to soak the slaves. kaladin argued that it was too early to be taking down the sides, but bluth stated that tvlakv wanted them clean today. realizing they were probably nearing their destination, kaladin scanned the landscape wondering where they were going. syl returned to tell kaladin there were many others like him nearby. as she pointed eastward, kaladin was shocked to see the enormous army encampment he’d heard stories about, the place tien wanted to go in the end, the army he spent years trying to get into - the shattered plains. bridgeman (1173)[edit] bridge four[edit] in 1173, tvlakv sold kaladin and the other slaves to hashal, the wife of the lighteyed officer who was in charge of the slaves in highprince sadeas's army. she was not impressed with the slaves, but kaladin stood out as he was still far more muscled than the others. when asked, kaladin confirmed he used to be a spearman in amaram's army. after inspecting his brands, and remarking that a ""shash"" glyph meant death, hashal asked how he got here. kaladin responded that he killed someone while drunk, and spoke of his talents with a spear and asked her to give him a chance to fight again in her brightlord’s army. however, tvlakv told hashal not to listen to him as he was a deserter, and could not be trusted as he had led rebellions before. any slaves he might have had corrupted were assigned to be bridgemen while kaladin was assigned specifically to bridge four, the bridge crew with the worst reputation and casualty rate. kaladin was placed under the command of the bridge sergeant gaz and was immediately forced to go on a bridge run completely unprepared and unequipped. bridge four was sent to carry a large bridge, allowing sadeas' soldiers to cross the plateaus of the shattered plains and assault the parshendi. gaz ran beside bridge four, calling out commands during the run due to their most recent bridgeleader having tossed himself down the honor chasm. he sent kaladin to the open slot at the tail of the bridge. without a vest, the wooden supports dug into kaladin’s skin causing his shoulders to bleed. as they ran, a nearby bridgeman offered kaladin advice. eventually, gaz called them to a stop and they lifted the bridge into place, allowing the army to pass. they repeated this process, with kaladin eventually asking why they weren’t turning around. one of the other bridgemen just chuckled and told him they weren’t there yet and to be glad they weren’t. after more than a dozen times, gaz ordered kaladin to the front for the final push, declaring that newcomers get to go first. kaladin quickly realized why arriving was the worst part. the parshendi volleys launched, killing the men around kaladin. they eventually got the bridge dropped, but at the expense of the bridgemen, resulting in many casualties. kaladin just collapsed, knowing he should move or at least bind his wounds, but he just couldn’t, falling unconscious instead. kaladin was about to be left for dead by the retreating bridge crews, until syl called out his name and urged him to move. he forced himself to his feet and asked the windspren if she had a name. as he limped through the casualties, he found the body of the leathery faced man who had been nice to him. he harvested his vest and shoes, tying them on as the windspren introduced herself as sylphrena. honor chasm[edit] over next few weeks, kaladin grew more and more depressed. of the twenty-five men who had survived his first bridge deployment, twenty-three had died leaving only kaladin and one other man. bridge four continued to be replenished, with many of those men dying to only to be replaced. they went through countless bridgeleaders, which typically was a favored position on a bridge crew, always getting to run in the best places. however, in bridge four, that didn’t matter. kaladin didn’t bother to learn the names of the bridgemen as it just seemed pointless. one day, as they were working in the lumberyard, new recruits were brought in to be assigned to the bridge crews. kaladin looked up and a young boy barely fourteen or fifteen caught his eye, reminding him of tien. he had the same frightened eyes which immediately made kaladin’s protective instinct kick in. however, all he could think of was how everyone he’d tried to protect ended up dead. syl, unable to bear seeing kaladin in such a hopeless state, decided to leave, afraid of what would happen to her if she stayed. on the next bridge run, the youth and the last man that survived kaladin’s initial bridge run died, leaving kaladin the senior member of bridge four. faced with losing syl, his only friend, and his inability to protect the boy, kaladin seriously contemplated suicide. that night, he went to the honor chasm, intending to jump off. before kaladin could step off the ledge, syl returned, excitedly carrying a leaf of blackbane with her. syl, in her naivety, having seen kaladin previously take heart in having the poisonous leaves with him, assumed they would make kaladin feel better. syl recalled how everything seemed to go wrong when he lost the leaves, how he used to fight and make his soldiers feel like family. she admitted that was one of the things that drew her to him to begin with. kaladin just lamented that he failed, that everything he touches withers and dies. syl pleaded with him to give it one more try, reminding him that he couldn’t hurt the bridgemen any worse. opening his eyes, he left the chasm and resolved himself to become bridgeleader. he marched up to gaz and seized the man by the throat, sweeping his legs out from under him. kaladin then intimidated and bribed the man into giving him the position along with the autonomy to run bridge four. entering bridge four’s barrack that night, kaladin found the men all huddled inside just as he left them. kaladin visited with each man, introducing himself as bridgeleader and learning each of their names. later, kaladin went to sleep with a sense of purpose in protecting the men. reforming bridge four[edit] the next morning, kaladin resolved to make some changes in bridge four. the first of these included training early in the mornings, putting an end to the group’s sleeping in. when moash protested, kaladin punched him in the gut and threw him over his shoulder, taking him outside. the others, shocked and not wanting to suffer the same fate, filed out into the sunlight. as kaladin outlined his plan, he was immediately met with resistance from his fellow bridgemen who felt chores and bridge runs were more than enough to build their endurance. kaladin argued that his primary duty was to keep them alive and since he couldn’t do anything about parshendi arrows, he had to make them stronger. moash called over to gaz and asked if they had to listen to kaladin to which gaz replied that the bridgeleader only had authority on the field. moash looked back to kaladin and told him to storm off, causing the rest of the men to leave as well. kaladin, undeterred by the men’s resistance, went off to the lumberyard to train by himself. he eventually attracted a crowd that included teft, rock, dunny, and some of the other members of bridge four. before the next bridge run, kaladin visited an apothecary to purchase some supplies so he could tend to the wounded. however, he quickly discovered that antiseptic was expensive, despite knobweed reeds growing just outside of camp. kaladin settled on a needle and gut as well as some bandages, spending the four marks he had left from paying gaz off. returning to camp just as the bells sounded, kaladin yelled for the men to line up for the next bridge run. as the men neared the parshendi lines, kaladin demanded to switch with rock, taking the most dangerous center-front spot of the bridge for himself, a rarity for a bridgeleader. during the assault, kaladin was adamant on rescuing the six who fell. he dragged hobber and dabbid to safety with the help of rock. as he turned to go back out to the field, teft and rock stopped him, going back to check on the other three. they returned with leyten, the only other survivor. kaladin quickly started to work, providing medical care to the wounded men. after the long battle, they returned to camp with their three wounded in tow much to gaz’s protests. because bridgemen were supposed to be expendable, kaladin was told that he could keep tending to the wounded men, but they would not be paid or fed while they were unable to work. not wanting to give in to brightlord sadeas, the bridgeleader asked other members of bridge four to pitch in money and food to care for the men. however, all refused except for rock. he offered to share his food with hobber, who was the least injured of the three. knowing it would only be a matter of time before the rotspren were attracted to the wounded, kaladin came up with the idea of collecting knobweed stems during stone-gathering detail. with the stems, he could create the antiseptic the men desperately needed and even sell some to get more supplies and food. gaining the trust of rock and teft, kaladin enlisted their help to find and collect the knobweed during their new detail. syl assisted as well, finding patches of knobweed and guiding rock-who was mysteriously able to see her-to them. while working to extract the sap that night, kaladin started building camaraderie with the two men, even managing to get rock to open up and share some of his life story. kaladin returned to the apothecary and made a deal for his bridge crew to gather knobweed sap in return for a skymark per bottle of sap and some bandages. upon returning from selling the sap, gaz sent bridge four to do chasm duty, recovering valuables from the war dead who had fallen into the chasms. in the chasms, kaladin continued to build rapport with the men, bringing dunny into the fold, who sang for the men while others hovered behind. through their work, kaladin came across a spear in the chasms. picking it up and holding it drew the ire of moash, sigzil, and earless jaks, who began taunting the bridgeleader. ignoring their gibes, kaladin closed his eyes and went into a trance. he performed an advanced practice kata with the spear, revealing his talent as a genius spearman to the men, leaving them speechless. during the display, teft, along with some of the other men, noticed an unknown spren-actually syl-zipping around kaladin. through the rest of their chasm duty and on the walk back, more men started to open up. the night culminated in kaladin using the money he had earned to purchase food and assigning rock to cook a stew. not a single person refused to partake in eating around the fire. the next day, a majority of the men followed his orders to rise out of bed and practice. side carry[edit] kaladin managed to get all the men to submit to his authority and participate in training. the training cut down on their losses, but kaladin was still unsatisfied. realizing that the bridge itself could act as a shield, kaladin started training the men to shift the bridge and carry it on its side. the practice was slowing going, which left gaz pleased at the prospect of bridge four losing more members. prior to the next bridge run, kaladin gained lopen as a member from a new batch of recruits. they were immediately sent the next run. realizing it was going to be a difficult approach, kaladin ordered bridge four to perform the side carry as they engaged the parshendi. the side carry was a success as it completely protected kaladin’s men. however, other bridge crews tried to emulate the side carry. not having trained in the maneuver, the other bridge crews failed. lacking a sufficient number of bridges to cross the chasms and with the timing of the assault desynchronized, the battle was thrown into chaos and sadeas lost. understanding that he’d undermined the army’s strategy, kaladin ordered rock and teft to stand down and kaladin stepped up to gaz and lamaril to accept his fate. the stormfather's judgement[edit] ""“i want you to go back into the barrack and tell the men to come out after the storm. tell them to look up at me tied here. tell them i’ll open my eyes and look back at them, and they’ll know that i survived. ”-kaladin to rock, teft, and moash before the highstorm"" as punishment for the failure, highprince sadeas demoted several officers and executed lamaril, the lighteyed officer directly in charge of the bridgemen. sadeas declined to execute kaladin directly, but instead decided to let the stormfather judge him. kaladin would be freed if he could survive being tied to the side of bridge four’s barrack during the highstorm. prior to the highstorm, rock, teft, and moash came to see kaladin and promised they would remember him. kaladin asked them to tell the men to come out after the storm and they will see that he had survived. teft gave kaladin a dun sphere for good luck and the men retreated into the barracks as the storm approached. as the storm raged and slammed into kaladin, syl told him to grab the roof and then the ring that his rope was attached to. he did as she said knowing that if he let go, he’d be dangling in the air again. however, the rain numbed his fingers and caused him to slip, flapping in the air again. as he hit the roof, everything went black and silent. during the darkness, kaladin met the stormfather in the form of a large, inhuman face. immediately after, kaladin’s surgebinding abilities manifested and he drew upon stormlight from the glowing blue sphere before falling unconscious. kaladin stormblessed[edit] after the highstorm, the bridgemen followed rock and teft to go check on kaladin. the bridgeleader hung by his ankles, his skin sliced in a hundred places. just as the men gathered around him horrified, kaladin’s eyes snapped open. his hand dropped the sphere that had been given to him, now dun, shocking teft who knew the sphere should be infused. wanting answers, he told kaladin he better survive and the men rushed to cut him down. they cared for him and posted a constant guard by his bed. his injuries were severe, even attracting deathspren. while recovering, teft brought three infused spheres telling kaladin he couldn’t leave them. he watched as kaladin unconsciously consumed the stormlight, causing teft to suspect he may be a member of the knights radiant. ten days later, kaladin made a miraculous recovery and his men, never having known of his previous army service, revived the name kaladin stormblessed. transforming bridge four into spearmen[edit] after his recovery, kaladin accompanied bridge four on their next bridge run. once they dropped the bridge, kaladin watched the battle raging on the next plateau alongside rock and sigzil. the latter asked why the bridgemen weren’t allowed to use shields during runs. rock suggested that shields would slow them down, but kaladin realized it was because they were bait. kaladin slipped into despair as he realized there was no hope for his men. things were compounded the next day when kaladin met matal, their new commander, and was re-acquainted with his wife, hashal. she informed kaladin that her husband would not run the bridge crews with the same laxness as his predecessor. hashal then permanently assigned bridge four to chasm duty. given the new orders and knowing their place as bait, kaladin realized that further training as bridgemen would be a futile endeavor. instead, he proposed training the men to become spearmen in order to escape, which his men accepted. during a highstorm, kaladin dreamed he was the storm, traveling east to west, seeing the ground from the perspective of the storm itself. he passed over the shattered plains, the sea of spears, kholinar, the horneater peaks, and countless other cities and villages. his path crossed szeth’s in the middle of an assassination. finally, he met the stormfather once again, who left him with a cryptic message regarding the oathpact being shattered and odium reigning. kaladin gasped awake to find himself being restrained. he attacked his “assailants,” but quickly realized they were just members of bridge four. they told him he had been in a fever dream and that he tried to walk out into the highstorm. shaking off his vision, kaladin went to clean up, even letting rock give him a shave. later that day, bridge four was given a new recruit, a parshman that kaladin named shen. kaladin found himself walking around sadeas’ warcamp an hour later, still worried about his dream. he asked syl if she knew anything about odium, which caused her to hiss and flee immediately to a nearby building. before he could ask why the word set her off, kaladin heard a series of curses behind him. turning, kaladin witnessed adolin kholin saving a prostitute from being beaten by a lighteyed officer. choosing to escort the prostitute to the border, adolin threw an emerald chip to kaladin and told him to deliver a message that he couldn’t make his meeting and would reschedule. kaladin took the money, but didn’t deliver the message due to his disdain of adolin’s attitude and lighteyes in general. syl returned, but was distressed at kaladin’s increasingly dark attitude concerning lighteyes and his breach of the implicit agreement to do as adolin asked. during their chasm duty detail, kaladin secretly began training bridge four, which had now dwindled to twenty-four members, as spearmen. to assist with the training, kaladin tricked teft into revealing that he had been a soldier and appointed him to oversee the men. to maintain their cover of working in the chasms, he assigned lopen, rock, dabbid, and shen to do the actual salvage work with syl’s assistance. kaladin was impressed at the men’s progress after only a few hours and remarked that thanks to their adverse conditions, they were ironically the most motivated and fit recruits he had ever seen. in one of the next bridge runs, dunny was killed. frustrated, kaladin began rescuing members from other bridge crews, commanding his men to carry them back to the barracks despite barely having enough resources to care for his own men. kaladin’s actions coupled with the fact that the arrows seemed to dodge him when he ran point further raised teft’s suspicions about the bridgeleader being a knight radiant. during chasm duty a week after dunny’s passing, bridge four found slightly more than an emerald broam’s worth of money, including an actual emerald broam. with the money, they realized they could not only feed and care for the wounded bridgemen, but they could also advance their escape plan. kaladin decided to turn over the emerald broam-an amount of money that no bridgeman could ever safely spend-but kept the rest. rock, though an avowed pacifist, took up a bow and attached the pouch to the underside of one of the permanent bridges using an arrow. lopen covertly retrieved the money during their next bridge runs and turned the money over to kaladin. discovery of surgebinding powers[edit] in one of the next runs, bridge four dropped to just twenty-six members when both maps and arik died. kaladin struggled to deal with their deaths, worried that soon he’d be the only one left. the rest of bridge four also appeared anxious as they fell in with their bridgeleader. returning to camp, kaladin dismissed the men, who in turn gave him a salute that teft taught them. teft lingered, allowing the bridgeleader to look at his arm. under the ruse, teft punched kaladin, forcing him to unconsciously use his powers to defend himself. kaladin demanded to know what teft was doing, who just replied that he was testing something. before either man could discuss it further, lopen pointed out that kaladin was glowing. grabbing teft, kaladin demanded to know what he’d done to him. teft denied doing anything, pointing out that kaladin had been feeding off stormlight since he’d been sick. seeing syl out of the corner of his eye, kaladin confronted the spren about his powers. realizing they come from the knights radiant, kaladin grew scared and wanted to be rid of them. syl questioned why he’d want to be rid of something of the windrunners. kaladin wondered if he was cursed, which caused syl to run away. when lopen and teft found him, kaladin fled, overwhelmed at his new discovery. that night, kaladin came across hoid, who told him the story of derethil and the wandersail, a story that kaladin interpreted as one about taking responsibility. before hoid left, he gave kaladin a trailman's flute and charged him with looking after his apprentice, sigzil, who he now graduated to a full worldsinger. syl, who was present for the story, returned to kaladin and explained she was behind what was happening to him. syl offered to cut off their bond, but it would leave them both crippled. however, kaladin decided to accept the responsibility that surgebinding represented and use the power to help others. kaladin spent the next week trying to learn how to use his surgebinding powers with teft’s help with little to no success while bridge four continued to train under rock’s leadership. while trying to learn surgebinding, teft told kaladin what he knew of the knights radiant, teaching him the first ideal of the immortal words. ""“life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination. ”-first ideal of the knights radiant"" their training was interrupted when hashal came to visit. she informed kaladin that bridge four would now go on every bridge run, citing they were a “model” for the other crews. they would no longer get the normal break between runs, a further reprisal for the side carry incident, and would now do chasm duty at night. responding to the increased danger this change brought, kaladin came up with a plan to use the skins of dead parshendi found in the chasms as armor. in order to bring the armor out of the chasms, kaladin successfully managed to use his powers to run up a wall and attach the armor to the underside of the permanent bridge they originally used to hide the spheres. during one of the next bridge runs, kaladin donned the carapace armor and ran ahead of the bridge crews, drawing the attention of the parshendi. the desecration of a parshendi corpse enraged the warriors who focused all of their efforts on kaladin, ignoring everyone else on the battlefield. drawing in stormlight, kaladin dodged arrows, his muscles reacting quickly. as bridge four came into range, an arrow cut open kaladin’s arm, but to his surprise, it began to seal up instead of bleed. continuing to serve as a distraction, kaladin’s surgebinding abilities protected him and the bridge crews from any harm, marking his plan a resounding success. while bridge four was resting and watching kaladin treat a thaylen man, a group of parshendi soldiers attempted to ambush them. however, dalinar kholin came to their rescue and saluted them as he left. given the success of the carapace armor, matal gave kaladin permission to outfit all of bridge four in the armor, with his wife hashal claiming it was her idea the entire time. he set leyten, an apprentice armorer, to work on making the sets of carapace armor with the help of the wounded men. meanwhile, the spearmen’s training advanced rapidly, with moash and skar emerging as the most skilled. battle of the tower[edit] ten days later, on tanatashev 1173, bridge four participated in the battle of the tower, where the combined armies of highprinces sadeas and dalinar assaulted the tower. by this time, they had not only perfected using the carapace armor and large wooden shields, but they had made enough sets to outfit the entire unit. kaladin led the charge, staying in front of the other decoys, trying to distract the parshendi forces as best he could. however, his efforts weren’t as successful as the first time he donned the armor. five bridge crews dropped, slaughtered right where they ran. while bridge four fared better, they didn’t arrive unscathed. skar and teft both suffered injuries, which kaladin tended to once they reached the tower. once kaladin finished, he surveyed the battlefield and to his surprise, sadeas was retreating. at first, he thought something must be wrong, but then he quickly realized that sadeas had set up a trap, abandoning dalinar and his men on the tower with no means of escape. bridge four retreated with the rest of sadeas’ army, lagging behind so they could carry their wounded. as kaladin carried the bridge, he had the idea of using the battle to escape, allowing the army to think that his men had been killed. once matal agreed to leave them behind, kaladin explained the details of the escape to the men and offered to stay behind with the wounded men. bridge four protested, but kaladin commanded them to stick to the plan. however, there was more than just the wounded men plaguing him. looking back to the tower, he watched as dalinar and his men continued fighting. the men of bridge four asked if there was anything they could do, but kaladin refused, claiming it would be suicide. syl, who had taken up the form of a full-sized person, spoke up and revealed that she remembered being an honorspren, a spirit of oaths, promises, and nobility. after a moment of internal conflict, kaladin ordered his men to turn around and head back towards dalinar’s army. kaladin led bridge four as they charged the plateau in hopes of giving dalinar’s army a chance to escape. he was filled with one purpose only and that was to protect. he ran ahead, dodging arrows, but he quickly realized something was wrong. syl drew his attention back to bridge four and the many arrows pointed at their unshielded flank. he ordered them to go into the side carry position to deflect the arrows, something they hadn’t done in weeks. reaching his crew, he turned just in time to see more archers behind them drawing for a large volley. he screamed and threw every bit of stormlight he could into his shield, pulling over a hundred arrows into it. seeing what kaladin had done, both groups of parshendi that had released volleys turned and fled. knowing that kaladin was in no condition to run the bridge, moash led the rest of the men onwards to help dalinar. kaladin crawled to the edge of the chasm and asked syl if she could help make him stronger, but she shook her head. as he listened to the sounds of war and death around him, he was transported back to the most horrible of days, the day tien died. when he snapped out of his trance, syl asked him if he knew the words. wanting to save his men, kaladin took up a spear and spoke the second ideal of the windrunners, progressing his path to becoming a member of the knights radiant. ""“i will protect those who cannot protect themselves. ”-second ideal of the windrunners"" kaladin fought with amazing prowess, his natural talents enhanced to unnatural levels by stormlight. he single-handedly engaged and defeated dozens of parshendi. kaladin and his men held the bridge until dalinar’s soldiers were able to fight their way to them. during the brief respite, the bridgeleader checked on his men, learning they had suffered three casualties and several injuries. kaladin organized the retreat, putting teft in charge of the bridgemen and keeping moash by his side. upon closer inspection of the alethi soldiers, kaladin realized that neither highprince dalinar nor adolin were with them. heading back to the front lines, kaladin found the cobalt guard, the group sworn to protect adolin, still fighting. knowing they wouldn’t leave without their highprince, kaladin searched for adolin and ordered him to retreat. however, adolin refused to leave without his father. kaladin convinced him to go with moash while he went to retrieve dalinar. he leapt over the chasm to where dalinar was fighting with eshonai, both of whom were utilizing a full set of shards. fighting a shardbearer for a second time, kaladin rescued dalinar and retreated with what remained of his army. dalinar commended kaladin for his actions and promised that he would ensure their safety from sadeas. a promise kept[edit] when they arrived back at the warcamps, kaladin and the rest of bridge four accompanied dalinar to confront sadeas. dalinar offered to pay an exorbitant sum of money, sixty emerald broams each, for the freedom of each bridgemen, but sadeas refused. finally, dalinar offered his shardblade oathbringer in exchange for the men, which proved to be an offer sadeas couldn’t refuse. with the deal made, dalinar walked up to a shocked kaladin and instructed him to gather the men he left behind and go to his warcamp. later that night, dalinar offered to make the bridgemen soldiers in his army, with bridge four becoming his personal guard. kaladin accepted an appointment to the rank of captain, agreeing after dalinar promised him an extraordinary amount of authority and autonomy for a darkeyes. kholin's bodyguard (1173-1174)[edit] rebuilding the army[edit] after the massive casualties at the battle of the tower, kaladin was tasked with turning the remaining bridgemen into a standing army. he promoted teft, moash, skar, rock and sigzil to lieutenants, a rank between captain and sergeant, to form a command structure for a thousand men. more specifically, kaladin named rock quartermaster, with lopen as his second, and appointed sigzil to be their clerk as he was the only one who could read glyphs. he put teft in charge of training, suggesting that he combine the remaining bridgemen into twenty crews and train two members in each to go back and train the others. kaladin promised a few men to assist teft, but explained that would have to do as most of bridge four, including moash and skar, would be needed to keep dalinar alive. without the highprince, kaladin feared that the bridgemen would just be sold back to torol sadeas by his successor. with word spreading that the emperor of azir was dead at the hands of the assassin in white, kaladin reminded teft that the assassin had already killed gavilar and they just had to hope he was done. regardless, they had to protect dalinar at all costs. freedom, bridge four[edit] once in agreement, they rounded up the rest of the men in bridge four and went to get their slave brands covered with tattoos. hobber sat down first, with each man following, receiving tattoos that said “freedom, bridge four.” sitting down last, kaladin closed his eyes and waited for the tattooist to finish. she cursed, revealing that the tattoo ink wouldn’t take. kaladin sighed, realizing he was unconsciously holding stormlight in his veins. he banished the stormlight and she tried again, the ink taking this time. he looked in the mirror, seeing his slave brands covered up for a moment. syl landed on his shoulder and he unconsciously sucked in stormlight which melted the tattoo. the tattooist cursed again and picked up her rag, preparing to try again. however, kaladin insisted that it was fine and tossed a small bag of spheres to the tattooist. ""“the scars haven’t finished with me yet, it appears. i’ll try again another time.”-kaladin to the rest of bridge four when his tattoo melted away"" upon bridge four’s return to the barracks, rind was waiting for them with their new cobalt guard uniforms. while the men eagerly tried on their uniforms, teft hesitated, unsure if he deserved to wear something like this again. kaladin objected, saying the uniform was what he was and not to let the slave rule him. teft countered, asking kaladin when he was going to admit he was doing the same thing. teft tried to convince him that he needed to show dalinar that he was a surgebinder and a lighteyes. however, kaladin confessed that he had everything taken away from him by the lighteyes and for now, he couldn’t let them take this too. dropping the subject, teft put on his uniform and joined the others. with the uniforms sorted out, the men cut off the insignia of the cobalt guard, declaring themselves bridge four. becoming what dalinar needs[edit] kaladin set up rotations to protect dalinar, always assigning himself, moash, or skar for the blackthorn. after a small council, dalinar wished for kaladin and his best men to take on more duties extending to protecting navani, his sons and eventually king elhokar himself. dalinar confessed that there may have already been an attempt on the king’s life when the gemstones on his shardplate seemed to be sabotaged. unsure of who to trust, dalinar asked kaladin to familiarize himself with how the king’s guard works and to learn from them. once their training was complete, kaladin would be in charge of a new group guarding the king consisting of some of the old king’s guard and kaladin’s own men. kaladin worried that his men were stretched thin, but dalinar said he was not alone in that problem. during a trip to the chasms, kaladin asked syl what she thought about dalinar’s plan to reform the knights radiant. she exclaimed that not only was it a wonderful idea, but she was jealous that he thought of it first. he then asked her if a spren could be writing the glyphs on the wall. while she didn’t know, syl admitted that she had seen a spren like red lightning, a dangerous spren. kaladin asked syl if there were more like him. though she expected the question, she didn’t answer him at first. she eventually told him that there were others like him as spren, those she didn’t know, tried to reclaim what was lost. syl goes on to say that kaladin has to become what dalinar is looking for and not to make him search in vain. while in the chasms, sigzil conducted some baseline tests of kaladin’s surgebinding abilities with rock and lopen’s assistance. they had to rely on counting as sigzil didn’t have a proper clock to time kaladin, nor did he even know how to measure stormlight. kaladin suggested that they use chips since they were weighed before being encased in glass. however, sigzil worried that he was wasting kaladin’s time as there was still so much about stormlight that they didn’t know. lopen reassured him that it wasn’t a waste and asked if kaladin could stick him to the wall. able to do so, rock commented that this skill could be very useful in battle. they continued to experiment further with his new abilities, the others taking up spears to test him. just like with his spear, kaladin knew these new abilities would take lots of practice. this meant kaladin would have to find a new person like himself to spar with. calling it a day, the men returned to the warcamp and to the news that a hero had come to the shattered plains. kaladin’s heart became ice when he heard the hero was none other than highlord amaram, the man who stole kaladin’s shardblade and branded him a slave. preparing for the assassin in white[edit] kaladin led a patrol through the lighteyes' training grounds with moash and drehy, to guard adolin and renarin. syl encouraged kaladin to tell dalinar about amaram, but he refused, thinking he wouldn't be believed. kaladin talked with zahel, an ex-soldier ardent, but was left alone soon after. kaladin asked syl if she found zahel weird, and she replied saying all humans other than rock seemed weird. later, kaladin watched zahel train renarin. zahel was having renarin jump off the roof of the grounds to practice being comfortable with shardplate's strength. kaladin mocked renarin's clumsiness, but zahel countered, saying renarin had a good attitude about it. zahel offered kaladin the chance to train under him, but kaladin declined. kaladin participated in a mock duel with zahel, who used a blunted shardblade. kaladin lost, but zahel believed kaladin could have given someone enough time to escape in a real fight. adolin, who had been practicing further away, insulted kaladin, which angered him. kaladin charged at adolin in a fit of rage, but was quickly defeated, as adolin was wearing shardplate. zahel berated the prince for his carelessness. kaladin used stormlight to heal himself, and ran at adolin again, only to lose his strength and collapse. zahel commended kaladin for his quick thinking, but claimed it would not be enough against a shardbearer. kaladin asked syl why his energy suddenly dissapeared, and she responded, saying he was not protecting anyone while attacking adolin. during each highstorm, kaladin gathered all those who were under his protection in one location to make it easier to keep them safe. however, he blamed himself when the countdown to the everstorm continued to appear. after a particular highstorm, king elhokar was nearly killed after the railing of the balcony he was standing on broke free. kaladin and dalinar concluded that the support was cut with a shardblade and that it was an assassination attempt. later, kaladin approached dalinar and told him about amaram's betrayal and kaladin's branding. dalinar was doubtful, believing amaram to be an honorable man, but agreed to look into it. this angered kaladin, leaving him unsatisfied with dalinar’s promise. kaladin figured he'd take matters into his own hands, but syl countered, saying kaladin was not a skybreaker and was worrying her. soon after, dalinar requested that kaladin and his men learn how to ride horses, as they might be useful in the future. the groom thought it was absurd for darkeyes to learn horseback riding, but she taught them anyways. kaladin was hesitant to learn at first, but he did so anyway, at the wishes of dalinar. at first, he rode an old, mellow horse named spray, until adolin rode by and taunted him for not riding a fast horse. he jokingly told kaladin he should ride dreamstorm, a wild and violent horse. kaladin decided to do so, and mounted the horse. as it bucked him wildly, he was forced to lash himself to the saddle using adhesion, lest he get flung off. he was whipped around, until he finally ran out of stormlight, flinging him several feet in the air and landing across the stable. the attempt impressed adolin, so he apologized for taunting him. kaladin talked with natam about the assassination attempt, and who was on the balcony. natam told kaladin that the only person on the balcony after the storm was moash, before riding away. the next highstorm, kaladin had a dream in which the stormfather visited him. the stormfather said that kaladin would soon betray syl, thereby killing her. when he woke up, syl told him that something was wrong, and that the one who hates was coming. kaladin, trusting syl's word, entered dalinar's room and warned the of the impending danger. dalinar trusted kaladin's instincts, so he retrieved the king and they all fled from the palace. hobber and beld scouted ahead, while moash and elinor stayed by elhokar. as they ran, they came to a dark hallway with the spheres drained and a large cut in the wall. szeth appeared from the darkness shortly after. kaladin, dalinar, and adolin fought szeth, while renarin and other bridge four members escorted the king out of the palace. eventually, adolin was defeated and kaladin's arm was severed by szeth's honorblade. this left dalinar to fend for himself. as dalinar fought szeth, kaladin arrived and pushed both him and szeth through the hole in wall, and they tumbled to the ground. as they fell to the ground, kaladin consumed stormlight from szeth's reserves, which allowed him to heal himself from the fall. szeth was shocked at kaladin's survival, and denied the return of the knights radiant. he fled after he saw kaladin heal his arm, and kaladin collapes from exhaustion. kaladin soon woke up and reentered the palace, searching for any dead or injured. he found dalinar and the others resting and tending to any wounded. dalinar expressed his surprise at kaladin's survival, and kaladin lied, saying he lived due to szeth's abilities. kaladin left to search for his men, and found beld's dead body, along with hobber, who had lost his legs from szeth's blade. upon seeing he could barely defend against a shardbearer, kaladin visited zahel and asked if he could train under him. training continues[edit] kaladin continued to lead training of the bridge crews, and assigned teft to train bridge seventeen in the chasms. kaladin wanted to defeat szeth, now that the bridgemen were mostly safe. while he surveyed training, kaladin met with sigzil, rock, and lopen, to further discuss kaladin's abilities. after many attempts, kaladin fianlly lashed himself to the chasm wall. kaladin experimented a little, before he and the others returned to the barracks. they were met with a tense dinner gathering. renarin kholin had come to the fire, and asked kaladin if he could join bridge four. kaladin allowed him to join, albeit with discomfort at letting a lighteyes join their ranks. moash, teft, and a few other bridgmen requested kaladin go out with them to get drinks, but kaladin declined the offer, and got some stew. after accepting zahel's offer to train, kaladin, teft, moash, and yake visited the training grounds. zahel had them each practice with one of the king's blades to get comfortable with the sight at one. they also practiced basic sword stances, which would allow them to better attack and defend against a shardbearer. while taking a break, kaladin noticed shallan enter, who had come to update the shardblade and plate record. he walked with adolin towards her, and they shared some banter. kaladin returned to the water barrel, and moash arrived shortly after. they discussed the reason for moash's hatred towards the king, and kaladin agreed to meet with the moash's partners. he talked with syl about what was right, and mentioned dalinar's maneuver when fighting szeth to zahel, a lastclap, before training some more with the other men. kaladin surveyed some of the bridge crews one night, before syl convinced him to relax a litle and get some stew. he made his way back to bridge four's barracks, and was met with two herdazians: lopen's ""cousins."" kaladin found shen stacking bags of grain in the storage room, and kaladin apologized for being hesitant to arm shen. he handed a spear to shen, before being called out by moash. upon moash's prompting, kaladin agreed to get drinks with some of the bridgemen. when they arrived, peet got them a table and rock told the story of his people. eventually, moash took kaladin aside, and they met with graves and some others, including danlan, a women adolin had previously courted. graves asked kaladin to consider assisting them on their mission to assassinate elhokar, and kaladin hesitantly agreed, to syl's dismay. as they left the room, kaladin forbid moash from talking or meeting with graves and the others again. ""“how long had it been since he felt this good, this triumphant, this alive?”-kaladin reflecting on his flight"" one night, kaladin strolled along the shattered plains, looking for the place at which he met wit, months before. upon reaching the desired location, kaladin stepped off the edge, plummeting into the chasm. after sucking in stormlight to assist with the landing, he took off in a jog and practiced lashing himself to the walls of the chasm. after some time, he was able to do so without stumbling, and was soon able to repeatadly lash himself quicker and more accurately. he threw caution aside and lashed himself upward, towards the sky, and experienced true freedom and triumph for the first time after tien's death. soon, he was hurtling past chasms and plataues at incredible speeds. kaladin lashed himself higher and higher, before reluctantly returning to the ground, fearing he would run out of stormlight. he conversed with syl for a moment, before he retured to the warcamps. but rather than returning to dalinar's camp, he traveled to sadeas', realizing he could kill amaram right then and there. syl pleaded for him not to and reminded kaladin of the experience he just had. intent on not tainting the memory, kaladin returned to dalinar's camp. upon returning, he encountered shen, who said he needed to leave, and gave kaladin his real name: rlain. he then departed. adolin was guarded under kaladin on the day he was supposed to meet with shallan. as the pair made their way to the carriage, kaladin realized the driver was none other than wit. as the carriage moved along, kaladin spoke with wit, who revealed he knew about kaladin's abilities. when they arrived at sebarial's camp, shallan hugged wit, to everyone's surprise. kaladin accompanied the couple to a menagerie in the outer market. on the way there, he rode in the carriage with adolin and shallan, as he was suspicious of her. upon their arrival at the menagerie, kaladin realized wit was gone, replaced with one of adolin's servants. kaladin talked with syl and walked with adolin and shallan as they observed the animals. soon, dalinar arrived, accompanied by amaram, who was wearing a strange cloak. dalinar then announced that the knights radiant had been reestablished, with amaram at their head. adolin's duel[edit] ""“honor is dead. but i'll see what i can do. if this goes poorly, take care of my men. ”-kaladin to dalinar before jumping into the arena."" during adolin's duel against relis ruthar, elit ruthar, abrobadar, and jakamav, kaladin guarded dalinar and elhokar while they watched the duel. after seeing renarin enter the arena and quickly fall to the ground, kaladin proclaimed honor dead, and asked dalinar to take care of his men if things went poorly, before jumping into the arena to help adolin. as he entered the arena, syl promised this would be different than when kaladin defended amaram. relis ignored kaladin at first, but quickly realized his opponents' skill. kaladin regrouped with adolin and told him to focus on breaking their opponents shardplate. adolin requested kaladin watch out for renarin, who was very vulnerable. kaladin drew relis' attention while adolin fought elit and jakamav. relis dueled kaladin for a short time, but then returned to fight adolin. kaladin used a lashing-enhanced kick to knock relis down, breaking his own legs in process, though he was able to heal them using stormlight. kaladin noticed that he cracked some of relis' shards with his kick. adolin's own armor was mostly cracked, though he managed to land a strong blow on elit's chest plate, cracking it and slowing elit greatly, giving kaladin the chance to force elit to yield. the remaining three opponents gathered to battle adolin, while renarin sat alone in the sand. kaladin demanded elit give him his helm, who complied, and used it as a armored gauntlet, then continued to help adolin. relis and jakamav both tried to attack kaladin, but he was able to dodge their shardblades or block them with the helm, until he ran out of stormlight. at this point, kaladin realized that he had been feeding it to the plate in order to keep it from shattering. kaladin eventually was backed against a wall, until adolin appeared and grappled jakamav to the ground. kaladin noticed that abrobadar had been defeated by adolin as well. relis, the last man standing, rushed toward renarin, who was vulnerable. kaladin followed, and yelled for renarin to yield, however renarin only dismissed his blade, and did nothing more. relis raised his blade toward renarin, but ended up swinging it at kaladin, who then caught it in a lastclap. relis heard the scream that came from kaladin holding a shardblade, and ran from the arena, forfeiting the duel. jakamav demanded for adolin to fight him as he was held down. rather than actually fighting, kaladin placed his knife in a crack in jakamav's plate, and told him to yield. jakamav yielded and adolin was declared the victor. adolin laughed joyously at the spoils he won and asked kaladin to help him remove his drained armor. elhokar announced how impressed he was by the duel, and offered adolin a boon. kaladin noticed sadeas trying to leave the arena, but before sadeas could slip away, adolin demanded the right to duel sadeas, right then and there. kaladin, who realized this was his chance to duel amaram, also demanded the right to challenge him, for his crimes of murder and obstruction of justice, which caused amaram to cower. next to kaladin, adolin groaned, and the crowd silenced. elhokar ordered kaladin to be arrested. after the duel, dalinar, elhokar, and kaladin conversed in dalinar's rooms. kaladin sat chained to a seat, while dalinar and elhokar argued. elhokar argued for kaladin getting punished, dalinar against. eventually, they reached a compromise: imprisonment. elhokar left, and dalinar berated kaladin for his actions. soldiers soon came to take kaladin, all of them respectful. as he shuffled through the camp, the eyes of soldiers and scribes fell upon him. when kaladin reached his cell, he promised to never trust a lighteyes ever again. in prison[edit] kaladin's prison cell was nicer than most, but he still hated it. he talked with syl about dalinar, and said he was just like all the other lighteyes, though he quickly took it back. he tried to consume stormlight from a nearby gem, but failed. soon, wit entered unannounced, and sat on a bench. he carried a stringed instrument, which he was tuning. despite kaladin's reluctance, wit began his story, one of a man named fleet. in the story, fleet raced against a highstorm across roshar. in the end, fleet reached shinovar but collapsed and died from exhaustion, leaving his spirit to live in the storms. as wit told the story, kaladin interjected between lines, prompting wit to continue. kaladin was able to clearly see fleet and the story being told in his head while his eyes were closed. as the tale came to a close, wit and kaladin discussed the origin of stories, before wit left. life dragged on in kaladin's cell, though his accommodations were nice. when dalinar entered the room, kaladin jumped to attention and saluted him. they spoke about elhokar and dalinar's attempts to free kaladin. dalinar revealed what he knew about roshone and how he ended up in hearthstone, much to kaladin's surprise. dalinar encouraged kaladin to act better, lest he ruin the reputation kaladin had built for darkeyes. upon dalinar's departure, kaladin contemplated what he would do, eventually coming to the decision that elhokar had to die. as kaladin's release seemed to seem further and further away, the gloom drew closer. kaladin was able to reach the nearby gem and suck in some stormlight, albeit a very small amount. syl worried about kaladin and started to grow distant. finally, kaladin was released. as he left his cell, kaladin realized adolin had locked himself up, in protest of kaladin's imprisonment. when kaladin and adolin exited the room, bridge four was there to greet them, saluting and cheering. adolin offered a full set of shards to kaladin, though he declined, and instead gave them to moash. as moash eagerly put on the armor, rock demanded they all celebrate with a feast, and bridge four retreated to their barracks. kaladin helped put the rest of moash's armor on and agreed to help ""accomplish their task."" moash ran to the sparring grounds to practice with shardplate, and kaladin rejoined bridge four. in the chasms[edit] kaladin joined dalinar, adolin, and shallan on a scouting expedition across the shattered plains. as they crossed the plateaus, kaladin noticed syl's absence, and his inability to consume stormlight. dalinar talked with kaladin regarding renarin's inclusion in bridge four and how it was affecting him. then, kaladin talked to adolin about a potential attack from szeth, and how they would defend against him. eventually, they reached the final scouting plateau, one that has a dead chasmfiend on top. as adolin, shallan and dalinar stood on the mechanical bridge, kaladin realized a bit too late about the incoming danger. he ran towards the bridge and so did adolin upon seeing his distress. while the prince was able to reach dalinar and save him, a carpenter from sadeas' camp pulled an emergency lever, which caused the bridge to collapse and sent kaladin and shallan to plummet into the chasms. as they fall, kaladin managed to suck in a small amount of stormlight, saving his life. shallan did the same, though neither recongnized the other as radiant. they wandered the chasms for a while, and begin to argue. soon, they heard a large scraping noise: a chasmfiend. shallan began to lure the chasmfiend toward them, so she could get a sketch of a live one, much to kaladin's dismay. eventually, they left and continued back towards the warcamps. they bantered for a bit, kaladin assuming shallan's life was easy and pampered. shallan responded saying that her father was abusive, and that her life was far from easy. syl had failed to reappear and had not responded to kaladin's pleas. soon, they heard a chasmfiend again, and they hid in a small fissure to escape it. the chasmfiend swiped at them, but was unable to hit them. kaladin planned to fight it, but shallan, desperate for a way to escape, gave him her shardblade to fight with. kaladin jumped out of the fissure and they both distracted the chasmfiend, shallan with lightweavings and kaladin with a shardblade. the chasmfiend managed to bite kaladin in the leg, severely weakening him, though as it came for another attack, kaladin stabbed it in the roof of it's mouth with the shardblade, finally killing it. as the highstorm approached, the pair grew gloomy at their imminent death. kaladin realized they could use shallan's blade to cut a cubby out of the chasm wall, which would provide them protection from the storm. shallan climbed upon the chasmfiend's back and started cutting handholds upward towards the water line. finally, she finished, and started helping kaladin climb up, as his leg was weakened. kaladin barely reached the cubby as the stormwall hit. kaladin received a vision from the stormfather, in which he was told he had betrayed syl, killing her. when the storm ended, the pair found their way back to the warcamps, with bridge four there to meet them. dalinar soon came, and kaladin saluted him, despite his leg. dalinar tells everyone to meet the needs of kaladin, as he was a hero for bringing back shallan. the third ideal (1174)[edit] saving elhokar[edit] after his return from the chasms, kaladin stayed at the warcamps to heal, as syl had disappeared. he went to the starting plateau to see bridge four off on the expedition to the center of the shattered plains. dalinar noticed kaladin, and asked amaram, who was nearby, to come speak with him. dalinar confronts amaram about the rumors about him. amaram confessed as dalinar placed his shardblade at amaram's throat. dalinar told him to take off his radiant cloak, and lets him go, despite kaladin's protest. kaladin thanked dalinar, and left to go rest. with the weeping underway, kaladin felt the darkness return. moash visited him and went over the plan to assassinate elhokar. kaladin walked through the empty camp, and tried to put his losses behind him. when he returned to his barracks, he found elhokar there, and they conversed about elhokar's confidence as king. elhokar mentioned that kaladin felt special, and that the shadows that haunted him vanished when he was near. he apologized for imprisoning kaladin, then left. later, kaladin walked throught the lighteyes' sparring grounds, and talked to zahel. he asked about wit, and tried practicing with a spear; even though his leg was weakened. kaladin then came to the realization that elhokar is dalinar's tien, before quickly making his way to the palace. when kaladin returned to the palace, he found no guards, worrying him further. when he entered the king's room, he found elhokar lying on a couch, unmoving. kaladin realized quickly after that the king was drunk, not incapacitated. he said that assassins were coming and that they needed to leave. as they do, one of graves' men appeared and stabbed elhokar in the side, before kaladin stabbed the man with his spear. as they fled, moash and graves appeared, both in shardplate. kaladin argued with moash about what was right, and moash readied himself to fight. moash attacked kaladin, and kaladin fell to the ground. graves and moash attempted to make it look like szeth attacked, and kaladin heard an argument between syl and the stormfather. kaladin stood, though with great difficulty, and placed himself in front of elhokar. he then said the third ideal of the windrunners, at syl's direction. ""“i will protect even those i hate, so long as it is right. ”-third ideal of the windrunners."" syl finally returned to kaladin, in the form of a shardblade. he sucked in stormlight and healed himself, exploding with power, which caused graves and moash to flee. however, before fully retreating, graves ranted over the fact that he had focused on making certain kaladin was separated from dalinar. syl then warned kaladin that something was very wrong. fighting szeth[edit] ""“the sky and the winds are mine, i claim them. just as i now claim your life. ”-kaladin to szeth"" while dalinar and the others were fighting the parshendi, kaladin plummeted towards the shattered plains, rejuvenated with power. szeth, who had come to kill dalinar, reacted in horror at kaladin's arrival. bridge four tossed infused gems to kaladin, prompting him to attack szeth, seeking revenge for the fallen bridgemen. as kaladin and szeth clashed in the skies, the two storms raged below. kaladin wondered why a highstorm had come, and syl answered, saying the parshendi had summoned it. syl became a spear to help kaladin better parry szeth's blows, who was denying the return of the radiants. kaladin fought szeth expertly, using different forms of syl to defend and attack. because of the hightstorm below, kaladin's gemstones were renewed with stormlight. after fighting for some time, szeth returned to the ground to kill dalinar, and kaladin followed. upon landing, the pair found an empty plateau, with no signs of activity. szeth realized that the armies had used the oathgate and traveled to urithiru, and flew off to the west, with kaladin in pursuit. kaladin managed to stab szeth in the foot, and then hit szeth in the shoulder. szeth finally acknowledged the truth, realizing he was never truthless. szeth stopped, and kaladin went for a killing blow, but sliced szeth's wrist instead, causing him to drop his honorblade. without the blade, szeth plummeted into the storms and chasms below. kaladin grabbed the blade out of the sky, and gave syl and compliment. kaladin returned to the ground, and found some of bridge four there, before using the oathgate to transport them to urithiru. kaladin met with dalinar, renarin, and shallan, with renarin revealing that he was a truthwatcher and dalinar revealing he was a bondsmith and had bonded with the stormfather. kaladin decided he would return to hearthstone, to reunite with his parents and save them from roshone. return to alethkar (1174)[edit] returning to hearthstone[edit] kaladin traveled to hearthstone to warn his parents about the approaching everstorm, doing what he could to prepare other villages and towns as he went. however, he was too late as the everstorm had already struck. walking through the destruction, kaladin was surprised to find light emanating from the manor house. entering the house, kaladin was stopped by one of roshone's soldiers. the guard led kaladin through the manor where the sounds of wounded led kaladin to a makeshift triage room. there, he found his father, lirin, and his mother, hesina, attending to the wounded. after an emotional reunion, the soldiers insisted that kaladin be taken to roshone. lirin offers to buy his writ of slavery, insisting that they will not take his son, lest they have to find themselves another surgeon. kaladin observes the wounded, determining they were not signs of battle, but rather of natural disaster. the soldiers sent for roshone who was surprised to see kaladin alive and insistent on seeing his brands. before the conversation went much further, kaladin punched roshone for his friend moash. kaladin apologizes for his actions and promises not to hit the brightlord again, but rather that they need to talk. roshone refused at first and insisted that his soldiers attack kaladin, but they refuse after kaladin summons syl. the brightlord tells kaladin that the parshmen escaped, but they fled instead of attacking the city. kaladin asks what direction they went, but roshone's soldiers do not know. kaladin promises to tell elhokar about the city's destroyed food supply. in return, he requests a horse to go hunt the parshmen and tells roshone that he can't stay. he warns the brightlord that he must stand up and lead his people. laral promises they will do it and arranges for kaladin to use a spanreed. kaladin questions whether or not she is truly happy and he is surprised to find she is content with her life in hearthstone. kaladin dropped the argument and returned to see his father. lirin is happy that he returned and is well, but is concerned that he is caught up in war. kaladin tells him that he is a ""watcher at the rim"" and must do what he can to protect others. his father understands and asks him to see his mother before he leaves. on his way, he runs into laral who has the spanreed set up for kaladin. he gives an update to dalinar, who encourages him to find out what the enemy is doing without taking any unnecessary risks. after their conversation, kaladin goes to see hesina who introduces him to his new brother, oroden. before leaving, kaladin promises he will come back for lirin, hesina, and oroden, but lirin insists that he must stay if the desolation is upon them. he assures them he will return and that dalinar has refounded the knights radiant and this time, they will not fail them. finding the parshmen (1174)[edit] hornhollow[edit] upon his departure from hearthstone, kaladin pursued the voidbringers. after two days, he arrived in the village of hornhollow. there, the townspeople had gathered for a town meeting. syl transformed herself into the shape of a shardblade and he was welcomed by the crowd. a lighteyed man asked kaladin if he'd rather rest and eat or attack the rogue parshmen. kaladin ordered the man to take him to them. an ardent informs him that the parshmen, about fifty in number and presumably in warform, sought the grain out specifically. two men were hurt during the attack, khem and another man. kaladin then seeks out the citylord who tells him that his scouts know which direction the parshmen went, towards kholinar. the citylord offers to have his men escort kaladin, but he departs alone, saying they would only slow him down. traveling with the parshmen[edit] when kaladin finally caught up to the voidbringers, he was surprised to find they not only were playing cards, but that they looked very different than what he expected. rather than being red and black marbled like rlain, the parshmen's skin was marbled white and red. they were not wearing warform, nor did they have red eyes. kaladin observed them for awhile and tells syl they had been wrong. these parshmen weren't the destroyers they had been told about. one of their number noticed him, sounding the alarm. as they took up their cudgels, kaladin hesitated. though he knew he could easily defeat them, it didn't sit right, so he surrendered instead. the parshmen bound kaladin to a tree while they debated what to do with him. against khen's wishes, they didn't kill him, but yet pulled him by a rope as they traveled. kaladin talked up sah, his captor, explaining card game strategies to him. as they walked, kaladin realized that the parshmen weren't monsters, they were just slaves, like him. sah argued that kaladin couldn't possibly understand what they had been through, but kaladin felt he did understand a little. continuing on, syl panicked, worried that the parshmen could see her or at least the spren could. syl explained that the spren leading the parshmen must be from him, a voidspren. syl stayed close to kaladin, just in case he needed to summon her. kaladin eventually spoke up, complimenting the parshmen and offering them assistance in their travels. sah refuses and they continue their pace until they stop for a break. sah's little girl, vai, brings kaladin some water and she asks him why his people won't leave them alone. he struggles to figure out how to explain the war and her ancestors to a seven-year-old. she retreats as the parshmen make camp and kaladin asks syl to help cut his rope. rather than summoning her as a blade, he dropped a rock alerting the parshmen to his freedom. he asked for his knife so he can build a fire and after a short conference, they allowed him to do just that. over the next few days, kaladin spent his time showing the parshmen how to cook food, bind wounds, and build equipment. sah becomes frustrated though that he needs kaladin's help at all, that he fled one master just to have to listen to him explain things that he should already know. kaladin explained that ""freedom"" is a strange word and that despite serving another brightlord, he feels more free now than ever. once sah finished the hatchet, he asked kaladin why he isn't afraid to show them these things. kaladin explained that he has a choice and that it doesn't have to come to war. despite his own words, kaladin fears that the war is inevitable, so syl encourages him to find the middle ground. revolar[edit] kaladin secured a private storm bunker for the growing group of parshmen in the vamah city of revolar after syl warned him of an approaching highstorm. khen was pleased with kaladin's work and the group hunkered down for the storm. while it raged outside and kaladin debated how much longer he could delay returning to urithiru, the yellow voidspren appeared beside him. kaladin told her he could see her and she replied that she wanted him to. she asked kaladin why he was still there and after a lie, he admitted that the world is changing and he wanted to see which way it went. she asked kaladin if he would fight them and he questioned if he would be allowed. she admitted that the final decision isn't with her, as she is just a messenger, but that he will find out once they reach their destination. she finally asked kaladin how he knew of the approaching highstorm. he said he felt it in his bones and she said humans can't feel storms. she gave him a knowing smile and then disappeared. while in revolar, the number of parshmen camping around the city continued to grow exponentially reaching at least 40,000-50,000 in number. sah told kaladin that the number was amazing, that he always imagined the parshmen having their own city and now they do. as they walked through the city, kaladin saw not only signs of the everstorm, but also of looting. he asked sah is this what he wanted, to conquer a kingdom and destroy humankind. sah confessed that he didn't know, but that he couldn't be a slave again. kaladin countered that they are his people and that a war to exterminate one side or the other can't be the answer. sah offered that maybe it doesn't have to be that way, but that he could fight alongside them in something bigger, oppressed against the oppressors. once he passed where syl was, she told him that there are a lot of yellow spren around and another highstorm is coming. as khen's group approached the parshendi leaders of the small town, the scribe evaluated them and asked about kaladin's presence. yixli spoke highly of him, but the scribe said that the fused would have to label him free. he stepped out of line and saw a tall parshwoman with red eyes, like those of the shattered plains. seeing the fused, kaladin knew it was time to go. he sucked in the stormlight from khen's pouch and took the pouch from her. he thanked khen for her kindness, warned her of the impending storm, and said that no matter what she is told, he didn't wish to be her enemy. he launched himself into the air as the fused began to scream. once in the air, kaladin looked over the scores of parshmen and he told syl he can't help but feel a kinship to them. she argued that they're voidbringers and they conquered the city, but kaladin explained that they are people who are angry and have good reason to be. he reminds her of how he felt about elhokar, but she countered that he changed his mind. they continue to argue and kaladin confessed that he just wanted an absolute right on this, not a moral code with exceptions. kaladin looked down at the city once more and they both realized the parshmen guarding the humans had not done any preparations for the impending storm. kaladin lashed himself down to them and shouted warning of the highstorm. they just stared at him, so kaladin summoned his blade and warned the people to take refuge wherever they did during the last storms. he charged the parshmen guards to do better and that if they wanted to claim moral superiority over the humans, they have to treat them better than they were treated. during the exchange with the guards, something crashed into kaladin, tossing him backwards. as they grasped for his throat, kaladin kicked them off and he lashed himself into the air. the red-eyed parshman that attacked kaladin glowed with what looked like dark stormlight. another creature appeared and kaladin lashed himself straight toward the stormwall. he pleaded with the stormfather to show mercy and spare the people below. the stormfather seemed to consider his request, but said it was something that could not be done. kaladin zoomed to the ground hoping to find the people safe, but it was all for naught. he hit the ground and dropped syl, seizing a young father, his son, and another woman. he led them to a group of two dozen people and walked with them. consumed with pain, kaladin sucked in stormlight and deflected the storm while the battered people huddled behind him. he provided them with cover, diverting the storm long enough for the people to reach the bunker. syl was impressed with what he had done, but kaladin was dissatisfied that it wasn't enough. kaladin pushed himself out of the stormwall and then rode in front of the storm for a good hour. syl instructed kaladin to follow the wind's nudging as the stormfather's way of apologizing. he allowed the winds to channel him for hours and by the time the storm passed, he found himself outside of urithiru. siege of kholinar (1174)[edit] training and recruiting bridge four squires[edit] the morning after his return, sigzil came to kaladin with a list of tasks and decisions for kaladin to make. he had a lot of details of running an army to tend to. together they went to the quartermaster's office to check out the royal emerald reserve, to be used for training. later, bridge four went to train and hold try-outs on the shattered plains, with rock providing food & drinks. king elhokar came by to watch the training to ask kaladin to join the kholinar mission. kaladin helped hobber breath in stormlight for the first time and hobber start healing his legs. the group spotted smoke in the distance, they found a caravan that was attacked by voidbringers. among the caravan was rock's family, who are introduced to bridge four. kaladin attended a conference of the radiants and leaders. he argued with jasnah about the motives of the voidbringers, arguing that the common parshsmen just want a place to live. he also vehemently disagreed with jasnah's suggestion to find and kill the heralds. later bridge four continued training, with almost all of bridge four now being able to draw in stormlight. kaladin was worried that none of the new recruits had drawn in stormlight yet, but by the end of the session lyn was the first new recruit to do so. after a later training, bridge four gathered at rock's cook fire to talk about fitting in, belonging, expectations, and how it sometimes made them feel alone. afterwards kaladin noticed rlain sitting alone, and asked rlain to explain how he felt. arriving in kholinar[edit] after his return, elhokar asked kaladin to join his mission to open the kholinar oathgate and transport the team by flying them with lashings above the highstorm, which would constantly renew their stormlight. before doing so, kaladin practiced transporting a large group in this manner by flying dalinar, navani, and others from the oathgate in stormseat to the warcamps, and by flying with shallan to unlock the thaylen city oathgate after queen fen rnamdi finally agrees to have it opened. afterwards, dalinar pulled kaladin aside to inform him that as a shardbearer, he was a lighteyes suitable to have a landed title. as such, he was granted an area of land on the deathbend river. after travelling to thaylen city, kaladin, along with elhokar, adolin, shallan, skar, drehy, ishnah, and vathah, undertook a trip atop the next highstorm, using it as fuel to travel from the shattered plains to kholinar. along the way, he noted that although he cannot reproduce his ability to influence the strength of the winds, he did create a sort of 'channel' that kept the group together as they flew. during the trip, he also briefly had a conversation with syl about his interest in shallan, after he reflected on how she seemed to embrace flying above the storms. once the group arrived, they discussed the beauty of the storm, and kaladin split from the group to scout below the clouds. over kholinar, he identified the banners of humans rulers, and noted the construction of singer stormshelters. kaladin finally gave in to his urge to gawk, but was alarmed by the dark aura around the palace. returning to the group, he consulted them and the group decided to sneak into kholinar, regardless of the fact that it was still in human hands. the group approached the city wearing disguises made by shallan. kaladin's illusion was particularly hideous. the king commanded kaladin to succeed, believing that he himself would fail. the wall guard denied them entrance, but the group quickly entered when the guard was distracted by an attack of the fused. kaladin wanted to help the guards, but adolin persuaded him to ignore it. they sheltered at adolin's tailor's house, and made plans. kaladin brought a letter from elhokar to shallan, for her to deliver to the palace. meanwhile, he watched the palace and helped shallan get back to the tailor's after she escaped. infiltrating the wall guard[edit] during the next planning session, elhokar charged kaladin with infiltrating the wall guard. adolin and elhokar attended a lighteyes feast to gain contacts, and kaladin went as the head of their guards. before joining the lighteyed guard tent he went for a walk along the wall. a patrol of the guards met him, and immediately tried to recruit him. they offered him a free meal, no strings attached. over the meal, the guards tried to recruit kaladin with offers of regular meals and comradery. they were willing to ignore any man's history so long as he was able and willing to fight with them. later highmarshal azure came by on her daily round, and kaladin was flabbergasted to discover she was a woman and the wall guard kept that secret. on elhokar's orders, kaladin joined the wall guard and went out with them on patrol. he quickly found a familiar sense of belonging with the squad and their banter. the squad helped deliver food to the city, followed by wall duty. kaladin tried to get information about azure out of the men. the wall was assaulted by the fused and kaladin started giving orders to get the defenders ready, but the attacks ended up elsewhere. kaladin reported his findings to adolin and shallan while they waited out the highstorm in a winehouse. after the high storm, when his platoon was having dinner with highmarshal azure, kaladin was sitting at the officers' table. the highmarshal and kaladin had a barbed exchange, both trying to get information from the other without revealing anything themselves. they were interrupted when the wall was attacked. kaladin and azure charged up the stairs to the wall and focus on the defense. the guard was in chaos under the coordinated attack. kaladin took charge of a platoon and in the following fight was drawn into a one-on-one fight with a fused. he managed to kill the fused and forced himself to use only the bare minimum of stormlight to heal himself after the encounter. the wall guards were in awe as it was the first fused killed. after the battle, azure pointed out he assembled voidbringer army, ready for the assault. when she heard about his kill, he reveals he is here on orders of the king. he convinced the highmarshal to reveal the hidden room lined with aluminum where the soulcasters are working. in return, kaladin told about the oathgate and how it is the only way to save the city. the wall guard send five to six hundred troops led by azure and kaladin to join the assault on the palace. assault on the royal palace[edit] when readying for the assault, elhokar gave kaladin the duty to save the queen and the heir. while the other with the troops storm the palace, kaladin, shallan, skar, and drehy used their radiant powers to engage and distract the fused. they seized the sunwalk and the eastern gallery, using shallan's illusions to fake their death, and meet the others in the palace. kaladin joined elhokar to lead a force, including noro's squad, up the stairs to the royal chambers. they found the queen, who has lost her mind and joined the enemy. kaladin searched the room and syl found little gavinor surrounded by red spren. using his sylblade kaladin cut one of the spren, and scared off the other spren. elhokar and kaladin then fled down the palace followed by the queen's guard. they were met at the bottom by a group of parshaman, led by sah, kaladin's friend. kaladin froze when he noticed he had friends in multiple of the fighting groups, the conflicting loyalties overwhelming him. he tried to stop the fighting, but his efforts were in vain. he was watching elhokar starting to speak the first ideal, when moash came in and killed the king. drehy, skar, and adolin enter just in time to save kaladin and pull him to safety. kaladin was in shock and watched while shallan activated the oathgate and the group ended up accidentally in in shadesmar. trip through shadesmar (1174)[edit] kaladin, syl, shallan, pattern, azure, adolin, and his blade's deadeye found themselves stranded in shadesmar. kaladin immediately drew in stormlight and started hovering, however, this drew the attention of all nearby spren. at syl's increasingly urgent requests, he let go of the light. kaladin was in a broody mood and barely talked, despite adolin's urging, while the group made their way to the land that represented the windrunner river in the physical realm. they made camp as they were all exhausted. the next morning, kaladin was sitting on a rock watching the surroundings when syl came to speak to him. she asked why he didn't sleep, and he evaded the question. she knew something was wrong with him, despite his denials. later, adolin started performing a morning kata; azure joined him, as did kaladin, who still struggles with the movements. the group discussed their supplies and strategy. kaladin pressed to go back to the oathgate to help the city. moreover, he was shocked to learn about shadesmar and the existence of spren cities among other things. the group marched along the peninsula corresponding to windrunner river in the physical realm. kaladin was frustrated and felt like they are abandoning kholinar and its people, though was aware his thoughts were irrational and linked to his depression coming back. when they reached the lighthouse at the end of the peninsula, kaladin tried to sneak up on it. as he attracted anticipationspren, he was quickly spotted by the lighthouse keeper, riino. riino believed kaladin was there to have his fortune told, while kaladin wanted to go and get the others. when he understood what riino was talking about, kaladin was aghast at the idea of seeing the future, and said they were looking for passage on a ship. outside the clouds changed as a highstorm is passing in the physical. kaladin is attracted by the globe on the table which was shining brightly and touched it. he had a vision of dalinar with nine shadows and the danger he was in, then a flash of thaylen city. later, kaladin sat to recover while the others arranged passage and supplies. they debated the destination, but had to take the ship sailed by reachers to celebrant. the next morning, kaladin woke up on the ship. the captain, ico, took him to the hold to get the special device that could make water for the humans. he then talked with syl, about the ship and why she was wearing a disguise. shallan and kaladin discussed spren and the weird ship. when arriving in celebrant, the group split up; kaladin went with adolin and syl to change money and buy supplies. kaladin got distracted by a stall selling paintings, including a painting from the court of gods seemingly depicting a figure with nine shadows. the group soon discovered that the city was under control of the fused. they narrowly escaped when syl surrendered herself to a ship of honorspren. the honorspren sailed south-west, letting the group move freely on deck except syl who was kept captive. kaladin was very angry over syl's imprisonment, and wanted to fight her free. eventually, kal went to the high deck to use a spyglass. he confronted the captain, and in the process revealed that dalinar had bonded the stormfather, which impressed the honorspren very much. shortly thereafter, they spoted eight fused in pursuit of the ship. they were close to longbrow's straits, here a land area, with thaylen city on the other side. using the bead of a room, adolin, shallan, kaladin, and their spren snuck into the bead ocean while the honorspren and azure held off the fused. kaladin flew them part of the distance, and the group had an exhausting hike across the land to get to the thaylen city oathgate, only to find it guarded. the group attacked the oathgate in an attempt to get back to the physical realm. kaladin used some of the remaining stormlight to attack the fused, he managed to draw four into an extended chase. he managed to disarm one of them, and one of the others offered a challenge. exactly then his stormlight ran out, and he dropped into the beads. syl pulled him out of the beads, and during the whole fight encouraged him to speak the fourth ideal. kaladin wasn't ready yet. battle of thaylen field (1174)[edit] dalinar then opened honor's perpendicularity, allowing kaladin, along with shallan and adolin, to return to the physical realm. when appearing out of the perpendicularity kaladin blocked amaram's blow that was meant to kill dalinar. dalinar then ordered kaladin to guard him and settle the score with amaram. kaladin set off into the sky, and felt at home again. he attacked amaram, who was wielding two shardblades and had a red glow in his helmet. kaladin's fight was complicated as he also had to watch dalinar, and defend him from fused. slowly amaram was getting access to the surges while he was transformed by yelig-nar. kaladin was surprised by those, and had trouble adjusting his attacks and defenses. during the fight, kaladin was suddenly hit with a club by a fused hidden nearby. kaladin disabled the fused's arms with his shardblade, to focus on amaram again. he fought alternating with amaram and the fused. then amaram launched into a lecture about honor, which kaladin dismissed. kaladin attacked again and broke the highlord's breastplate revealing a large crystal underneath. kaladin attacked the gem and amaram fell, followed by an attack of eight fused. the fused swarmed kaladin, and he tried to dodge them while keeping them engaged away from dalinar. when dalinar trapped the thrill, the fused fled and suddenly amaram appeared again. kaladin whispered ""bridge four"" when amaram got shot by rock with an arrow in the head. afterwards, lopen brought stormlight to kaladin to heal. later, kaladin sat down on a rooftop overlooking thaylen city. he noticed shallan kissing adolin in an alley below. he showed syl a rock he found on the battlefield, one that changed color when wet. they talked about the recreance and what it means for the current radiants. he flew to bridge four and had a heart to heart with teft about the struggles of life. later a scout came with an urgent message. kaladin flew over the ocean to southern alethkar, where he found skar and drehy. they were hiding among the refugees together with little gavinor. the war continues (1174-1175)[edit] as the war raged on, kaladin was spread increasingly thin, which was only amplified by the fact that many of the original crew had started picking up squires of their own. in addition to splitting his time between battlefronts in southern alethkar and azir, he oversaw the windrunner training at urithiru and organized patrols to watch the coalition fleets from the skies. at some point, he was promoted to highmarshal. when navani requested windrunners to go on an expedition to akinah to find the oathgate there, kaladin initially suggested sending teft. navani refused the suggestion due to the risk of sending a ""key"" to the oathgate, in the form of a shardblade, should it already be taken by the enemy. instead, kaladin sent lopen, huio, and cord (who replaced kaladin's original choice of rock), telling them their mission was to see if the oathgate was still functional and whether it has fallen into enemy hands. evacuating hearthstone[edit] a few months into the war?, kaladin flew to hearthstone. it was a pre-arranged visit for him to meet and extract a rebel herdazian general, who would be hidden by his parents. while kaladin tried to sneak into the town as part of the line of refugees, multiple fused had arrived. they were looking for someone with the windrunner's description and they found him. kaladin fought with this new type of fused who could turn into a light, move quickly and turn back into a fused. the fused almost killed the windrunner by repeatedly severing his spinal cord, but kaladin managed to escape. they continued to fight, while syl and kal recognized it was a dangerous foe. kaladin noticed that after three teleports the fused needs a break to get more voidlight. after loosing the fused, stormblessed returned to hearthstone and was suddenly exhausted. when syl said they had shown him, kaladin replied he was almost killed twice. syl then expressed a worry about kaladin, who insisted he was fine. while approaching the town, syl wondered why kaladin had such trouble sleeping, as humans slept every day and even babies could do it. kaladin had no reply and felt disconnected from others. at the town, kal told the singer to fight him, or leave. six fought him and one died, after which the rest retreated, and left with the others. kaladin walked to where his mother was waiting and greeted his brother oroden, who called him ""gagadin"". his mother inquired after lyn, and syl replied she had broken up with kal. his mother and syl talk about him as he wouldn't talk about personal issues. he moved to the shed where his mother had hidden the herdazian general. he found several guards but the general had sneaked off, so kal asked the guards to pass the message with an invitation from dalinar. moving on, he was approached by his father who reprimanded him for not approaching covertly enough. the windrunner cut the fight short and told his father to start packing. knowing his parents would not leave the people of the town, he had brought an airship to evacuate them all. the highmarshal escorted his father up the ramp of the fourth bridge and introduced him to dalinar and navani. after lirin left to inspect the accommodations, kaladin apologized for his father's behavior which had been lacking in politeness. they quickly discuss the new fused and the need to defend the ship, and kal gets a new charge of stormlight from the bondsmith. he launched into the air, but not before touching the place where the old bridge was embedded in the deck. kaladin organized his windrunners while they watched the heavenly ones advance in the distance. he hoped leshwi would be among them, as he looked forward to fighting her again. the fused offered the windrunners one-on-one combat, creating an organized battle field. leshwi spotted the highmarshal and invited him for a duel. they fought in the sky with leshwi leading and kaladin pursuing. their flight led them around the battlefield and through the town. when they got near the airship, the fused slowed to inspect it more carefully. this gave kaladin the opportunity to get a normal spear from rock that he used a moment later to lash towards the heavenly one. with some fancy maneuvers, the fused managed to escape, leaving kaladin on the ground where teft asked if he was alright. they exchanged status reports, and kaladin ordered the windrunners to fight defensively. a new fused appeared and kaladin accepted its challenge. kaladin fought with the fused, and was winning quite quickly as the enemy was using up his light rapidly. when kaladin had him defeated, he decided to let the fused go as killing him wouldn't help as he would be reborn soon. when the fused dropped its spear and drifted away, kaladin noticed a red light streaking for him and started evading instantly. lyn swooped by checking in on him, and he sent her off with a message to look out for the teleporting fused. kaladin remarked to syl how the others were checking in on him and flew to dalinar, who was just getting a report from roshone. the former citylord offered to accompany an edgedancer to free prisoners from the manor's cellar. syl made kal admit that the man had improved despite kal still hating him. later kaladin had to watch while sigzil was fighting with leshwi, who was clearly the more skilled. he found it very hard not to interfere and help his friend, despite knowing that breaking the rules would be bad for the bigger picture. in the end leshwi defeated sigzil but spared his life in return for the fused kaladin had spared. she then challenged the highmarshal. they fought and dashed through the air, and he noticed most of the fighting was over. they left the town, and the windrunner realized he knew the terrain very well from his childhood. he used this knowledge to trick leshwi and scored a hit on her. shortly after, they managed to stab each other at the same time, draining each other's light. they both pulled out at the same moment and called it a draw. they scanned the terrain and noticed the fused from before near the manor go after some civilians. leshwi then gestured kaladin to go and save the civilians. near the manor, kaladin noticed the strange fused with a captured godeke entering the building. he entered as well, and they fought while a singer soldier activated a device that blocked the radiants' powers. the fused taunted kaladin that without powers he was nothing, but the windrunner used his experience and killed the soldiers and the fused. lift had slipped in and was helping godeke leave, and kal asked her to bring the device to navani. kaladin moved onward to the cellar where roshone had gone. he ran through the flames into the tunnel to the cellar, where he found two prisoners already dead. he turned and found moash, who held roshone and slit the former city lord's throat. moash asked whether kal came to save one of his enemies. when kaladin jumped to attack, moash dismissed his blade and surrendered. they then argued over whether roshone and elhokar deserved their fates. then moash started speaking in a fatalistic way, saying that everyone was going to die and no one could be saved. this hurt kaladin and started to exaggerate his depression. the windrunner froze when moash outright suggested that kaladin should kill himself. then a light exploded in the room that created a vision of who moash could have been: a windrunner protecting people. this led moash to flee, and the light faded to show renarin, who took kaladin back to the airship. retirement[edit] the airship had left hearthstone by the time kaladin started to come to himself. he looked so bad, one of the ardents brought him soup as if he were one of the refugees. even his stormlight gave him no energy, and he became depressed thinking about failing tien and elhokar. when syl informed him that laran had sworn the third ideal, he didn't want to join the crowd to congratulate her. his spren noticed his darkness was stronger and didn't know how to help him. teft came to see him and didn't let kal send him away. he told the highmarshal he would go congratulate the windrunner, and then they talked about moash. the former sergeant also mentioned that renarin had reported he had found kaladin frozen in place again. without answering, kaladin got up and went to laran to see her new blade. then he led the windrunners that flew dalinar and staff back to the shattered plains. when they approached the shattered plains, kaladin was feeling a bit better. syl came to him and brought yunfah, the only unbound honorspren willing to bond a radiant. kaladin wanted the spren to consider rlain, but the spren was hesitant. so kaladin ordered him to try to bond with rlain before bonding anyone else. the highmarshal then surveyed narak while landing. he walked to where the windrunners had landed their passengers and asked dalinar to go back to urithiru. the king denied it as he wanted to speak to kaladin. they spoke about the war, tactics against the heavenly ones, and the need for more windrunners. syl explained the other honorspren found the humans dangerous. the king praised the highmarshal for building up the windrunners as military force and then relieved him of duty. kaladin was distressed and at first disagreed, but after a heated argument he had to agree he needed a break from active duty. he wondered what if something happened to one of the others because he wasn't there, to which dalinar countered by asking what if something happened because he was there and froze. dalinar let him keep his rank and offered him a position in training the new forces. kaladin wasn't sure that was right, and he was allowed some time to think on how he wanted to contribute. after they took the oathgate to urithiru, kaladin was thinking about how he had almost no squires left, as most of bridge four had become knights and taken their own squires. many of them invited kaladin to join them for one activity or the other, but he declined them all and wanted to be alone. the moment he stepped into his rooms he broke. he sank down next to the door, and his emotions overwhelmed him, with the exhaustion and agony washing over him. he thought again about moash's words, about how everyone was going to die and he would not be able to stop it. he was taken out of his thoughts when someone started knocking on the door. it was adolin, who had been fetched by syl. the highprince insisted that kaladin join him for an evening out and wasn't accepting any more excuses. kaladin was forced to admit he shouldn't be left alone that night, and when they left he did thank syl. ""“is there anyone who doesn't like smart girls?”-kaladin in reply to veil who said kal liked smart girls."" adolin took them to his favorite winehouse, jez's duty, where he had his own booth at which veil was sitting already. when the barmaid came, he ordered an orange wine, as he knew alcohol would be bad for him in his current mood. veil and kaladin exchanged reports on their respective missions. radiant took over and explained that they had found a balance as the three, but that there was more going on with her. kaladin admitted he wasn't sure he could help, as he could barely keep it together himself. adolin returned, and he and veil talked about the ongoing wedding party and how kaladin didn't notice the bar staff. veil changed the topic of the conversation to finding someone to set up with kaladin, to the windrunner's horror. adolin and veil took turns suggesting women, and kal rejected them all. this went on until veil left to get another drink. ""“let her know you care, listen to her. be encouraging, but don't try to force her to be happy. and don't let her be alone, if you're worried about her...""”-kaladin's advice to adolin to help shallan"" after a bit of silence, adolin sat closer to kaladin. he asked what was going on, and eventually kaladin admitted he had been relieved of duty. adolin responded supportively and even allowed that his father could be wrong. he did not know how to, but he wanted to help, thinking that it might also provide him with a way to help shallan. the highprince eventually got kaladin to give him some advice on how to help shallan, and kaladin's suggestions were exactly the things adolin had been doing for him that night. the bridgeboy called his companion a fool and suggested they needed to get him a spren, saying that getting rid of his shardblade would help; adolin refused this adamantly. later, veil joined them and the evening went on. two hours later, when rock came to the booth, adolin and veil left to let them speak alone. kaladin tried to avoid the conversation, but rock insisted as kaladin had refused several times before. rock agreed it had been good to wait and give his family time to rest, but now he had to return to his people. he had to face the consequences of his action of lifting the bow to save kaladin's life. kal warned him about moash, but skar and drehy had agreed to escort rock and his family to the peaks. kaladin considered going with them, but he realized it would not solve his problems. they embraced in a final farewell, as rock didn't expect to come back from his journey. ten days after the return from hearthstone, kaladin attended a ceremony where sigzil was promoted to run the daily business of the windrunners while skar was promoted to lead the missions. the highmarshal was still figuring out what new role would suit him. he went to the sparring grounds looking for zahel, but the swordmaster was out on the field, as he had laundry detail that day. while walking to the field, kaladin made a short detour to visit rlain on the growing fields. the listener was overseeing the use of gemstones to aid growth of crops. rlain complained that humans could not hear the rhythms nor sing the pure tones. despite that they were making progress. kaladin told rlain that yunfah would try to bond with him. when rlain learned the spren had been pressured, he didn't want the bond. he then told kaladin how he became a bridgeman simply because he answered a question from his master. kaladin found the swordmaster along the laundry lines. he told zahel about his retirement and asked in a circumspect way if he could join the swordmasters. they discuss reasons to retire, and then zahel demanded kaladin fight him. they fought between the laundry lines, with zahel evading kaladin while making use of the sheets and a bunch of colorful scarfs. during the fight, the swordmaster continued to question the radiant on his motives. when kaladin was defeated, zahel declared that he could not join the ardents, as kaladin still loved the fight. they moved to the edge of the plateau, and zahel gave kaladin a lecture on realmatic theory, explaining how he, the heralds, and the fused were all type two invested entities. he told him that one would need a special weapon that could unravel their souls to kill them, and those weapons are dangerous. surgeon and mental health work[edit] some days later, kaladin used the oathgate to travel to the shattered plains while he contemplated what role he wanted. he had come to meet the fourth bridge and the refugees from hearthstone on it. he took his parents to urithiru and gave them a tour of the quarters set aside for the people from hearthstone. his parents and syl exchanged joyful banter while they moved about. after looking through the communal spaces, syl and kal showed lirin and hesina the suite of rooms they had prepared for the family, including a fully-stocked surgery room. despite the fact that it was stocked with the best and newest inventory, lirin felt it was useless, as the radiants had superseded the need for surgeons. kaladin disagreed and explained that as they had very few radiants who could heal, normal surgeons were still very much needed. at syl's prodding, kaladin revealed that he had retired, and his father immediately concluded that kaladin would start working with him again as a surgeon. before leaving with the envoy to the honorspren, adolin came by the clinic to say goodbye to kaladin. adolin noticed a long line of mostly women waiting to be helped and told kaladin that he was now alethkar's most eligible bachelor. syl explained how this new job was helping kal. the highprince shared some advice from zahel about war and suggested they spar when he came back. kaladin continued to work as a surgeon, which kept him busy and made him ""not sad."" when the girl who was reading for him left, syl suddenly started to read the medical reference book for kaladin, she had learned to read the week before. during a break on one of the balconies, he saw a group of windrunners flew by and gave him a salute. on his return his next patients was teft, who couldn't leave with the army. he has had enough of the war and his struggle with his addiction. they argued a bit, but kaladin had to accept teft who would not leave him alone. kaladin and teft went to track down a patient who had come through the surgery a while ago. he had been sent to the ardents who after a suicide attempt send him to the devotary of mercy. the bridgemen found the monastery and a dark corridor full of people in solitary confinement.they were shocked and questioned the treatment, which was defended by the ardent. kaladin talked to the patient noril, and could relate to his depression. against the ardents protests, they took noril to a balcony to talk and exchanged experiences. kaladin then talked to the ardent who said this wasn't in the book of treatments.they had only one treatment for all patients, and kaladin realized different illnesses need different responses. he was going to try something new. kaladin started his efforts by focusing on the men with similar symptoms as noril, battle fatigue, nightmares and melancholy. he organized a group therapy session where they could exchange experiences. his mother was impressed by the results, and kaladin explained how it was important to be able to speak with someone who actually understood what you felt. and for them to not just know but feel that they weren't alone. some time later, lirin and kaladin discussed the treatment of the patients. lirin explained how he did not know how little they knew about mental health. kaladin followed up that the social stigma had prevented research taking place. he wanted a medical revolution, but his father cautioned that change was hard. while they talk, kaladin slowly realized he could have ended up in the sanatorium. then teft came in telling that dabbid had been missing for three days. they went to search. teft and kaladin went to the winehouse for drinks, both sticking to orange. shortly after, they were joined by rlain, the whole place falling silent when he entered. they talked about the war and their time running bridges. then they talked about dabbid and how kaladin thought the meetings might be helpful for him. the others including syl make clear they think kaladin himself should also join them. he admitted it was helping him. capture of urithiru[edit] while still at a tavern in urithiru, the capture of urithiru began when teft fell unconscious and slipped into a coma. kaladin, while feeling some effects from the sibling's corruption, turned out to be the only radiant who remained conscious still in the tower due to how close he was to his fourth ideal. when kaladin took teft to the clinic that lirin ran he discovered several other radiants unconscious. kaladin wanted to resist against the invaders initially, but was convinced to stand down knowing what may happen to his family if he were discovered. during the first day of the invasion, he went delivering supplies and news to the people of hearthstone, staying up through the night helping others. however, when several regal and singer soldiers were going around the tower collecting fallen radiants, kaladin could not risk them taking teft, and he fought back and killed a regal. he and lirin argued, and kaladin was told to go; to attempt to protect his family, kaladin took teft and ran into hiding. with the help of syl, kaladin went far up into the tower, as far away from other people as possible, but was chased by the pursuer. with what would be revealed to be the help of the sibling, he was lead to a hidden room for refuge. kaladin continued to experience severe nightmares and visions while in hiding. after waking for the first time in hiding, he realized he needed a way to gather supplies so he could resist the fused and take care of teft. kaladin, with the help of syl, snuck around the tower gathering stormlight and approached kuno to ask him for supplies and ensure he could help him in the future. once he returned to his hiding spot, navani contacted kaladin for the first time through the sibling's veins throughout the tower. together they developed a plan to scout the oathgates and determine how the fused were able to work them even with kaladin's powers not working as they should. while taking care of teft, dabbid was able to find the hidden room with the help of the sibling. kaladin felt a sense of relief knowing that teft would not die if kaladin died or was captured; he put dabbid to work taking care of teft while kaladin went on his mission to observe the oathgate. when night fell, kaladin went with syl to spy on the oathgates. he had to climb the side of the tower to avoid being spotted since his lashings were not working to their fullest capacity. he saw the oathgate flash with voidlight that night and determined that they would probably use the oathgates as infrequently as possible to avoid being spotted. kaladin decided to steal a spanreed the fused were using to gather information. syl changed colors to mimic a voidspren in order to distract the singer guards so kaladin could steal a spanreed. just as kaladin got matching spanreeds, the sibling begged for his help; one of their nodes had been discovered by the fused. kaladin, unsure whether he was risking exposing himself to the pursuer, decided to find the node anyways. when finding the location of the node, raboniel allowed the pursuer to attack kaladin while she corrupted the sibling. kaladin tricked the pursuer into being locked into another hidden room of urithiru and was able to destroy the node to minimize the sibling's corruption. by the time kaladin was able to stop raboniel, he noticed a considerable difference in his healing in particular, especially after raboniel injured him to observe how his powers were fairing. raboniel allowed kaladin to escape, and he ran back to the hidden room and collapsed. navani came up with the idea of using the glove created by her ardent tomor for kaladin to use in replacement of his missing lashings, and with some training, he was able to use it in combat. the sibling sensed that the fused had found their node in the well on the main floor of urithiru, and while kaladin was trapped in another nightmare, dabbid nearly went in his place to protect the node. once awake, kaladin hurried to the main floor, and there the pursuer was once again waiting for him. while fighting the pursuer, kaladin challenged leshwi to a duel, knowing that a fight with her would be more honorable and would keep the pursuer at bay. kaladin, with the help of syl, aimed himself towards the well, to avoid further injuring himself after going through a loophole to avoid a true duel with leshwi. kaladin was able to swim with help from tomor's device and destroyed the node in the well. unfortunately the sibling's corruption had gone so far that his healing was nearly gone, which was especially noticeable since raboniel had injured him again. kaladin went to escape the well, knowing he would be surrounded by fused, but he and syl were separated and the pursuer locked him in by adding weights to the top of the well. kaladin escaped to the underground reservoir and attempted to get to his hidden room but was at risk of being surrounded by singers. instead, he escaped to the outside of the tower during a highstorm to wait for his stormlight to renew. while on the side of the tower, dalinar was able to contact kaladin through the highstorm; after falling unconscious, dalinar pushed him into the tower using the winds. kaladin was taken back to the hidden room by dabbid, but he fell into a coma, having his consciousness taken to braize by odium. during this time on braize, kaladin found wit, who created a bubble of protection to prevent odium from discovering him for a short amount of time and told kaladin the story ""the dog and the dragon"". ""“you told me it would get worse. it will, but then it will get better. then it will get worse again. then better. this is life, and i will not lie by saying every day will be sunshine. but there will be sunshine again, and that is a very different thing to say. that is truth. i promise you, kaladin: you will be warm again. ”-wit to kaladin"" dabbid went to ask for help from rlain, as he believed kaladin was dying, and venli helped get lift out of her prison to heal kaladin. lift healed both kaladin and teft, and they began to develop a plan to protect the sibling's final node. when they learned that the final node was in danger, exhausted, kaladin went to face the pursuer once more with the remnants of bridge four, lift, and venli. kaladin destroyed the pursuer's reputation, deeming him ""the defeated one"", and defeated him by humiliating him. but, after feeling energized, he discovered teft dead by the hand of vyre and was rendered catatonic. the 4th ideal (1175)[edit] after teft was killed by vyre, kaladin became emotionally broken. he killed the pursuer in a rage, while a heavenly one took lirin up to the top of urithiru. kaladin followed, using navani's fabrial, whereupon the heavenly one grew frightened and dropped lirin. kaladin stood atop urithiru, watching lirin fall, and realized why he came to the top of the tower. at honor's chasm, he chose life, and so this time, he made the opposite choice: he jumped, attempting suicide. however, dalinar, riding the storm at the time, demanded that the stormfather give kaladin more time to think. the stormfather took kaladin into the ""place between time"" and talked to him, albeit unsuccessfully. dalinar, using his bondsmith abilities, took kaladin into a vision connected to tien. the apparition of tien convinced kaladin to embrace the moment and accept that all people must eventually die, admitting that he chose to be used as cannon fodder to cheer up the other boys. returning to the real world with newfound sense of peace, kaladin kept falling, but found the strength to declare his fourth ideal. ""“i accept that there will be those i cannot protect! ”-kaladin's fourth ideal"" rather than the stormfather, it was dalinar who accepted kaladin's words. around kaladin, windspren transformed into his shardplate. teft's funeral[edit] kaladin attended teft's funeral after the fused were fully exiled from urithiru. he left the gathering early to try to speak with dalinar, who attempted to apologize for forcing him to retire from military duty. kaladin stopped him, affirming that it was the right choice, and requested that he be allowed to continue furthering his pursuit in the burgeoning field of mental health. dalinar accepted this request and also returned his trailman's flute, which was thought to be lost until lift found in the breakaway market. after their conversation, kaladin and syl went to the breakaway market to look through the merchant's bins where lift found the flute. he found a carved wooden horse that tien had given him just before they entered the army. he was shocked to see it in urithiru, as he had lost it in alethkar. remembering tien through it, kaladin decided to buy the horse off the merchant. following this, he went to the tavern to attend a group therapy session, like he had promised teft. relationships[edit] adolin kholin[edit] kaladin first sees adolin saving a darkeyed prostitute who is being harassed by some lighteyed officers. despite this kaladin, due to his past interactions with lighteyes, marks it up as an act. their relationship sours even more when they next meet face-to-face, with kaladin seeing adolin as spoiled and arrogant and adolin disliking kaladin's condescending attitude and willingness to order those clearly above him in rank. their interactions manifest in glares and taunts with each only tolerating the other out of necessity. this changes when kaladin, at a suicidal disadvantage, aids adolin in a battle against four other shardbearers. after the duel, while the king offers a boon to adolin, kaladin unknowingly embarrasses elhokar by demanding a right of challenge to face amaram in the arena, resulting in his incarceration. this only further convinces kaladin that lighteyes can't be trusted. upon being freed, however, he discovers that adolin had demanded to be locked up in the same prison, and had refused to be released until kaladin was pardoned. when questioned why, the prince only says that it wasn't right after kaladin had saved his life. adolin then offers kaladin one of the newly won sets of shards, though the former bridgeman refuses both, stating that the artifacts had killed too many of his friends for him to want anything to do with them. confused, the prince instead gives the set to moash at kaladin's recommendation. from there the two become good friends, although their friendship is stressed due to their mutual attraction to shallan davar. after a while, shallan and adolin confess their love to each other and kaladin gives up on her for good. throughout their relationship, adolin notices kaladin's numerous depressive spirals and helps to break him of them, subtly or not, by forcing kaladin to spend time around friends and not be alone with his thoughts. adolin's support of kaladin is highlighted after kaladin is relieved of duty as highmarshal, resulting in kaladin's depression worsening, and adolin insists he accompany him to winehouses and various outings. bridge four[edit] drehy[edit] drehy was one of the first friends that kaladin made on bridge four, and one of the first people to stand up for him. he was also one of the first men that kaladin trained in first-aid. while kaladin does accept his sexuality, he isn't completely bereft of homophobia. he considers drehy to be unmasculine, and considers drehy's own beliefs in vorin gender norms to be funny considering his sexuality. his displays of this prejudice are rare, but when they do occur they clearly make drehy uncomfortable, and he isn't afraid to speak up about it. moash[edit] kaladin and moash have a very complex relationship that changed in nature drastically over time. in the beginning, they were both members of bridge four, but they had a very tense and hostile relationship, with moash constantly mocking him and challenging his authority as bridge leader. kaladin often has to resort to forcibly dragging him out of the barracks in order to get him to do his duty. eventually, they become rather close, despite their occasionally disagreements in philosophy. their relationship began to turn towards hatred once again once moash attempted to assassinate elhokar, and later became a servant of the fused. it was only further soured by his successful assassination of elhokar during the siege of kholinar. moash himself has complex views on kaladin, but all of these feelings can ultimately be boiled down to overwhelming obsession. teft[edit] teft was the first bridgeman kaladin approaches to ask for support in his plans for bridge four after refusing to commit suicide at honor chasm, and due to this they developed a very close relationship over time. teft was also the first to suspect kaladin's nature as a nascent knights radiant. kaladin worries about teft's firemoss addiction, and wants to help and support him, but respected his privacy enough to leave him alone until it became a serious problem. teft's death during the occupation of urithiru was enough to fully push kaladin over the edge, leading him to become almost catatonic. eventually, the despair from losing him led him to attempt suicide again, and actually go through with the attempt. although dalinar managed to convince him to survive while he was falling, leading to him swearing the fourth oath. he still feels a deep grief over his death, and does his best to follow through with the promises he made with teft, joining in group therapy sessions and working to fix the way that alethkar deals with mental health. teft felt a sense of pride at how kaladin was able to keep fighting no matter what tried to drag him down. shallan davar[edit] kaladin and shallan are among the first new knights radiant in centuries. they both reveal themselves independently during the battle of narak, together serving as the catalyst for the refounding of the order. kaladin and shallan initially have a strained relationship. during their first meeting, shallan tricks kaladin out of his new boots. during their later meetings, kaladin suspects shallan of being a spy or opportunist at worst, and a privileged, unempathetic lighteyes at best. this clash of personalities is reflected in their respective spren, as the cryptics (to which shallan's spren pattern belongs) and honorspren are involved in a complex spren conflict. later, when kaladin and shallan are both stranded in the chasms of the shattered plains, they grow to respect and admire one another. during this time, they reveal some of their personal history and secrets to each other, including the fact that shallan has a shardblade. although unsure of their own natures as members of the knights radiant, this incident causes them to suspect each other of being more than meets the eye. as time passes, the two of them grow closer together, with shallan admitting that veil is attracted to him. in the end, however, she chooses adolin instead. when syl asks how kaladin feels about this, he claims that she lifted his burdens a bit and reminded him of tien (possibly since they were both lighweavers), but that he never actually loved her. sylphrena[edit] sylphrena, known as syl, is the honorspren that kaladin has bonded. syl is kaladin's constant companion and perhaps his best friend. in addition to providing kaladin with companionship and guidance, kaladin's bond with syl is what allows him access to his surgebinder abilities and to become a member of the knights radiant. syl is also a living weapon and is able to manifest herself as a shardblade. syl's existence, the knights radiant, and kaladin are linked together. when kaladin doesn't live up to the oaths that he has made as a knight radiant, syl slowly loses intelligence and is eventually ""killed."" when kaladin reaffirms his oaths, he is able to revive syl, although it is implied that there is a way for kaladin to more permanently kill syl. initially, syl is attracted to kaladin because of his urge to save others.[citation needed] in this initial stage, she behaves much like a normal windspren, having no sentience. as her bond with kaladin grows, she gains intelligence, progressing from child-like naivety to understanding complex concepts. she also begins to remember parts of her past; for example, she remembers her own name (and her nickname) when kaladin asks her if she has a name. she also gains the ability to manifest herself into different forms, initially as things like a ribbon of light, a leaf, and a young woman, and eventually into a shardblade. kaladin shares with syl his regrets of not being able to save those closest to him, and when he is at first unable to swear his fourth ideal, syl is very supportive of him. because she wants to understand kaladin better, she goes to dalinar and asks him to connect her to kaladin so she can feel what he feels; he doesn't do exactly what she was expecting, but in remembering her former knight syl does begin to feel grief and other shades of sorrow that help her understand kaladin's depression. family[edit] lirin[edit] kaladin and his father were originally very close, and he trained him in all of the minutia of surgery and medicine. lirin was very proud of how quickly kaladin learned, and wanted him to devote his life to becoming a surgeon. he believed that he could some day surpass him in skill. despite their rather positive relationship, the two often got into fights about the value of soldiers and of surgeons. these debates often resulted in lirin getting angry at his son for his idolization of the military and his belief in alethi jingoism. he attempted to instill in kaladin his own sense of pacifism, and fundamentally disagreed with the idea that one can take lives in order to protect others. even in his time as a slave and soldier, he still looked at his father as a true man of honor, the most honorable man he has ever known. he respects how he healed even those that hated him, which would likely have come to helped shape his third ideal. he still holds tightly to many of his teachings. after they reunited, their relationship became immediately strained. lirin was heartbroken by how his son, despite everything that he had taught him, had become a soldier and a killer. he thinks of what had happened as being like the military system taking his son away from him. tien[edit] kaladin's younger brother, due to the difference in nahn between his family and the rest of the town kaladin had no real friends growing up and instead would spend time with tien. as a result the two of them became extremely close with tien being the only one who could cheer kaladin up when he became depressed, especially during the weeping. he is also very protective of his brother as shown when he effortlessly ignored his fathers pleas and threw away his chance at training in kharbranth. in the end, tien's death scarred him to the point where he spent the whole next year practicing with the spear to escape his pain, to the point where it nearly killed him even. years later, kaladin still feels remorse because of his inability to help tien. he forces himself to relive his grief every time someone close to him is killed. this causes him to develop a serious case of depression, to the point that he actually jumps off of the radiant city, urithiru. wit[edit] wit and kaladin's relationship is strange but positive; they've only met and had serious conversations a few times but each time wit has taken the effort to give kaladin some needed emotional support and reinforcement, thus far by telling him a story that goads kaladin into some sort of growth (despite wit's protests that the stories have no inherent meaning and anything kaladin gets out of them is entirely up to kaladin). wit generally spares kaladin his barbs and mockery, and treats him more kindly than most. kaladin seems to enjoy the encounters with him and even asked for a story in when they meet in his nightmare, something wit says people almost never do. development[edit] ""“back when kaladin was called merin, he didn't work well as a character. he was too much the standard ""farmboy who becomes a nobleman"" from fantasy genre cliché. ”-the way of kings annotations"" kaladin's precursor in the stormlight archive was merin, a character brandon came up with in the year 2000. in the original draft for the way of kings, the way of kings prime, merin wins a shardblade after defending elhokar on the field of battle. much like kaladin, merin is of low social rank (it's unclear if the concept of eye color denoting social status was already present). as such, there are people who don't wish to him to have the shards; however, at the insistence of dalenar (proto-dalinar), merin is made a shardbearer and adopted into house kholin. however, brandon was very dissatisfied with merin's character, feeling as though there was nothing interesting to him after he accepted the shardblade. as such, he set out to add more personality to him. the surgeon backstory came first, followed by the personal tragedy of losing a family member and the decision to have merin deny the shardblades, with all consequences thereof. finally, brandon decided to give the character depression to round him out. overall, it took about eight years for merin to evolve. the shattered plains plot, originally of dragonsteel prime, was moved to roshar partially to assist in that, giving more context to merin's slavery. merin's name was up for change for a while at this point, as it sounded too much like perrin. moreover, this new character felt too different to be still called merin, and brandon wanted this new protagonist to have a new, more mythic-sounding name; thus, kaladin was born. quotes[edit] ""“perhaps you should pray to the almighty for guidance. i hear he has a fondness for slavers. keeps a special room in damnation just for you. ”-kaladin to tvlakv"" ""“men are unreliable in many things. but if there's one thing you can count on, it's their greed. ”-kaladin to sylphrena"" ""“death isn't better. oh, it's easy to say that now. but when you

little translucent philosopher. we'll have to send you off to a monastery to spend your time in deep, important thoughts. ”-kaladin to sylphrena"" ""“storm you! look at that! who cares for them? not sadeas. not their fellow bridgemen. i doubt even the heralds themselves spare a thought for these. i won't stand there and watch while men die behind me. we have to be better than that! we can't look away like the lighteyes, pretending we don't see. this man is one of us. just like dunny was. the lighteyes talk about honor. they spout empty claims about their nobility. well, i've only known one man in my life who was a true man of honor. he was a surgeon who would help anyone, even those who hated him. especially those who hated him. well, we're going to show gaz, and sadeas, hashal, and any

Reacher,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Reacher,"""“they like to travel, to see new places. they sail all across roshar's shadesmar, peddling goods, trading with other spren. ”-azure"" reachers, also known as lightspren, are a subset of sapient spren on roshar. bonding with them makes a person a surgebinder of the order of willshapers. appearance[edit] physical realm[edit] in the physical realm, lightspren appear as a ball of light, small enough to hide in a palm of a hand. when they move, they trail around a glowing streak, making them look like a comet. the light can grow stronger or fainter, seemingly depending on the spren's mood. lightspren seem to be a little more tangible than their kinsmen when in the physical realm -- wind pushes them, they are warm, and feel somewhat like silk to touch. they can communicate through pulsing to the rhythms of roshar, which produces bursts of light, as well as audible vibrations. for a singer, those vibrations appear to carry more meaning than simple mood, including more abstract concepts like familial relations and high numbers. cognitive realm[edit] in the cognitive realm, lightspren appear human and can have features similar to different rosharan populations, though they have metallic bronze skin, making them look like living statues. they have bronze metal eyes with holes where the pupils would be. their hair is similarly metallic bronze; the lightspren pin them into buns and ponytails. unlike honorspren or cryptics, lightspren don't seem to have clothes as part of their essence; instead, they wear human-like clothing of earthy, tan colors, with numerous buttoned pockets. they seem to prefer going barefoot. while most lightspren adopt a human form, they can take other forms. lightspren are not known for being overly talkative to others. abilities[edit] the lightspren on ico's ship are barefoot so that they can walk along the vibrating copper lines set into the deck, which shallan believes are used for wordless communication between the lightspren. in the physical realm, lightspren seem able to move very quickly, as well as hover and fly, although they cannot become invisible. they are capable of overpowering lesser voidspren, and can live inside the gemheart of a singer. they can also pulse to odium's rhythms, though doing so appears to cause some pain. nahel bond[edit] lightspren are one of the spren types capable of forming nahel bonds. bonding them makes a person a surgebinder with the surges of transportation and cohesion. notably, they are the first sapient spren to be shown capable of forming a nahel bond with a singer rather than a human. while the bond does seem to afford them a higher level of intelligence as it does with other spren, lightspren appear incapable of communication; however, it's uncertain whether this is a consequence of bonding a singer, or if a lightspren bonded to a human would also be mute. despite this, they are able to communicate with their singer via pulses and rhythms and are able to read their knights thoughts. lightspren are able to mute the rhythms of their surgebinder. history[edit] during the heraldic epochs, the lightspren began bonding people in an effort to emulate the honorblades, giving rise to the order of willshapers. when the recreance came, they, like other sapient spren, lost a tremendous number of their kinsmen, including many family members. by the era of solitude, they managed to rebuild their society, becoming well-known guides and traders. when kaladin, shallan, adolin, their spren and azure were stranded in shadesmar, they managed to find passage to celebrant on a reacher-crewed ship commanded by captain ico, in exchange for barter supplies and dun spheres. it's uncertain how many lightspren have chosen to begin forming nahel bonds again, though there are some willing. culture[edit] lightspren are adept sailors and explorers, journeying across the sea of souls in ships pulled by teams of mandras. because of this, they often serve as guides for newcomers, and trade extensively with various spren cities and settlements. they usually don't carry weapons other than knives, although their ships are equipped with large harpoons, likely to defend them from hostile lesser spren. it's unknown if lightspren have settlements of their own, although they are very common in celebrant. there, they live and work, selling goods -- including off-world imports like nalthian paintings -- or exchanging money. celebrant docks also seem to be crewed mainly by lightspren , who assist in docking the ships and unharnessing mandras. while lightspren can be both male and female, they don't seem to practice any sort of division between genders -- both can be seen performing the same jobs, wearing the same clothes, and reading. the recreance has left the lightspren with a deep-seated mistrust in humans and their oaths. some seem to be understanding of humans using deadeye shardblades for their own purposes, though there is an undercurrent of resignation to this, as they seem to believe that it's inevitable for human oaths to be broken. nonetheless, they seem intent on being helpful, easily trading with humans and providing them with means of survival. they're also willing to provide advice free of charge. notable lightspren[edit] - captain - (bonded to - ) notes[edit]"

""darkness"" appeared as he attempted to apprehend lift; noura did not recognize him, and was upset that he was intruding in the palace with his minions. she demanded to see his papers, and although she found that they were in order, she was shocked to see that the sentence for a child thief is death. she told darkness to carry on, but then pushed a table into one of his minions, allowing lift enough time to access investiture and ultimately escape. noura and the other viziers followed darkness and came across gawx, who was dying after having his throat slit by one of the minions. they witnessed his seeming resurrection when lift healed him with stormlight. noura led a vote on the spot to confirm gawx as the new prime aqasix, believing that he would be able to survive an attack by the assassin in white. she retained her position as lead vizier after yanagawn was crowned and was said to miss lift while she spent time in yeddaw. ""“i am the emperor's loyal servant, but i do not like the idea of your radiants, dalinar kholin. these powers are dangerous, and the ancient radiants turned traitor in the end.”-noura to dalinar"" meeting dalinar[edit] noura met with dalinar kholin in azimir after he showed yanagawn some of his visions. she openly displayed her distrust of dalinar and the alethi, but admitted that yanagawn had been swayed by dalinar's arguments. dalinar presented the viziers with essays written by fen, navani, and jasnah, each of which contained compelling arguments regarding dalinar's alliance. noura was surprised by his diplomatic approach. the essays bought dalinar more time, and he had some strained conversations with noura about the current state of affairs on roshar while she led him through the city to a small waiting room. she informed him that azir's parshmen did not immediately prepare for war like those in alethkar, instead formally demanding reparations before being led away by regals or fused. after some deliberation, noura told dalinar that azir would accept his invitation to urithiru despite her own objections, and that other nations in the azish empire were likely to follow. dalinar's coalition[edit] noura directly advised yanagawn at the first meeting of monarchs in urithiru. she whispered various instructions to yanagawn, notably raising the question of whether the knights radiant's powers and the oathgates were safe to use. after some discussion, noura reached the conclusion that forming a coalition made sense, and yanagawn offered to send troops to jah keved. as the coalition prepared for war, noura traveled to thaylen city with yanagawn; she later wrote queen fen a poem thanking her for her hospitality. she also gave a report to the other monarchs regarding the movement of azir's fleet. however, numerous pieces of information suddenly came to light (including revelations that dalinar did not disclose all of the information about his visions, that elhokar had sworn fealty to dalinar as ""highking"", the arrival of an unexpected everstorm, and the translation of the eila stele) that threw the coalition into chaos. noura pointedly asked dalinar about odium appearing in his visions, and he admitted that he had. ""“that oathgate is dangerous. these powers of yours are dangerous. deny it.”-noura to dalinar"" noura realized that it was likely someone orchestrated the downfall of the coalition, but she did not care; she already lacked trust for surgebinders in general and dalinar specifically, and it was clear that he had withheld relevant information. the azish delegation abandoned the coalition and left thaylen city, refusing to use the oathgate. lift and yanagawn later second-guessed this decision, and yanagawn told noura that he would be dead without lift's radiant powers. lift had already stolen away from the ship, and yanagawn told noura that they needed to turn around. noura reminded him that the emperor of azir does not have absolute power, and that yanagawn would jeopardize the throne if he attempted to rejoin the battle against the wishes of the vizierate. before the argument concluded, they received reports that the alethi had joined odium's forces, seemingly proving noura right. yanagawn was baffled by this turn of events, as he was not aware that odium was using nergaoul to control the alethi. noura realized she was wrong about dalinar after the battle of thaylen field, as she attended the wedding of shallan and adolin, bringing gifts from yanagawn and lift. she, yanagawn, and the rest of the azish court also resumed their participation in the meetings of monarchs. ""“this betrayal will be felt-and prosecuted-by the azish for generations.”-noura about taravangian"" emuli offensive[edit] during the following year, noura began leading the meetings when the coalition gathered. she directed dalinar to describe his proposed assault on emul to the rest of the group, then asked to hear the opinions of the others. they unanimously agreed to the assault, and some of the azish court, including yanagawn, opted to go with the army. after taravangian's betrayal, noura agreed with the other officials that dalinar had handled the situation well. later, dalinar and jasnah met with the prime in his tent. noura took a seat to be present at the table with them, though she sat lower than they did. she disapproved of yanagawn relaxing enough to take off his headdress in their presence. noura had previously discussed jasnah with yanagawn, who had a higher opinion of the queen than noura did; when jasnah displayed knowledge of their customs, noura conceded that he had been right. however, the way that jasnah delivered the facts about urithiru's occupation and the seeming hopelessness of its recapture prompted noura to speak up in favor of taking it back. she was doubtful at dalinar's idea of recruiting the herald ishar to help, but suggested that instead of going to him, he send knights radiant to bring ishar to the camp. relationships[edit] yanagawn[edit] ""“azir can, and will, withstand a change in dynasty. your power is absolute, but you do not exercise it all. you must not. ”-noura to yanagawn"" as the senior vizier in the azish court, noura is highly influential on gawx after he ascends to the throne as yanagawn the first. yanagawn seems to like the viziers and notes that they do their best to educate him as quickly as possible. noura is generally at yanagawn's side during important meetings, and he sometimes sends her as an envoy in his stead. she believes that yanagawn should not always follow lift's advice, since lift is very impulsive. though she disapproves of the influence the other monarchs of the coalition have on him that relax his formality, by the time of the emuli offensive she respects that yanagawn has grown. he still looks to her for approval during meetings, but she fills the role of an advisor more than that of a teacher. lift[edit] ""“lift? you listen to her far too much, your imperial majesty. ”-noura to yanagawn"" noura is quickly able to ascertain that lift is not the dangerous criminal that nale claims her to be. lift claims that the viziers do not like her. she likes to playfully aggravate noura, but she also seems to trust her. although lift's quirky actions often confound noura, she also appears to be fond of lift. still, noura seems to be unsettled by lift's unpredictable nature; when departing thaylen city, she assigns vono to watch lift, but lift escapes with ease. dalinar[edit] ""“you are not what i expected, blackthorn. ”-to dalinar"" noura assumes that the alethi always attempt to solve their problems through violence, a stereotype that is particularly prevalent in azir due to the genocide perpetrated there by sadees the sunmaker. she is inherently wary of dalinar kholin because of his nationality, his powers, and his reputation. before meeting him, she assumes he will be half-man, half-animal, but her fears are quelled by his unexpectedly calm demeanor and his ability to speak azish. she still maintains a level of distrust for dalinar, and quickly turns on him after learning that he has not been forthcoming about all of his visions. she is not always enamored of his methods or ideas, but is willing to trust and work with dalinar again after his victory at the battle of thaylen field. notes[edit]"

Jah Keved,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Veden_civil_war,"jah keved is one of the five vorin kingdoms on roshar, situated in the eastern half of the continent. its capital is vedenar. geography[edit] located in eastern roshar, jah keved is the second largest state on the planet, claiming around 5,553,000 km2. in terms of real-world nations, this places it between india and australia in area. it shares its eastern border with alethkar and herdaz on three rivers, while in the west, it is bordered by tu bayla and triax. north to south, the country stretches across the entire continent, between the reshi and tarat seas. though verdant, jah keved doesn't possess many major rivers. the country's most notable geographical feature are the horneater peaks in the east, which form an important strategic barrier against the alethi. notable locations[edit] regions[edit] -

c.673)[edit] in c.673, the hierocracy was overthrown by the alethi conqueror known as sadees the sunmaker in a conflict that would come to be known as the war of loss.[expand] alethi war of unification[edit] after gavilar kholin unified alethkar into a single state, the veden fought a number of small border wars against the alethi, attempting to test their defenses. though they were eventually pushed back by the forces led by dalinar kholin, small conflicts between alethi and veden highprinces continued for many years. nonetheless, the country remained the main oasis of stability in the region. veden civil war (1173 - 1174)[edit] this changed, however, on tanatesev 1173, when szeth assassinated the veden king, hanavanar, along with a number of highprinces. this plunged the country into a chaotic civil war, with at least seven different factions hoping to claim vedenar and crown their leader king. the situation was further worsened by the presence of the unmade nergaoul, known better as the thrill, leading veden soldiers to fight with unprecedented degree of drive and brutality. the civil war lasted for a few months, with the final confrontation being the battle at vedenar. highprince valam emerged victorious, becoming the new king. however, he quickly passed the crown to king taravangian before ordering his illegitimate son, redin, to kill him. given valam's poor health and his insinuations shortly before his death, it's possible he was being poisoned by the diagram to achieve this, as it was them who instigated the civil war by sending szeth. the true desolation (1173 - )[edit] under taravangian's leadership, jah keved was, alongside kharbranth, the first country to ally with urithiru. fearing that it would be overrun by voidbringers, the king requested - and was granted - aid from other members of the coalition.. however, following the revelations of the eila stele, the country broke off from the alliance as part of diagram's plan to undermine dalinar. though king taravangian pledged himself to odium, jah keved was not part of his deal. however after the battle of thaylen field taravangian began preparing jah keved to switch sides. he did this by promoting people odium could control, putting his troops into position to betray dalinar ,and subtly indicating to his followers that the war was a problem for alethkar and azir. when taravangian gave the order the vedens turned on the coalition of monarchs and joined odium. politics[edit] government[edit] much like alethkar or kharbranth, the population of jah keved is divided into darkeyes and lighteyes, with the latter holding power. a number of weaker, lower-dahn noble houses owe fealty to a group of highprinces, who in turn owe fealty to a king. prior to the civil war, known veden highprinces were valam, abrial, boriar, evinor and jal mala. over the year 1173, most of the country's political structures have either fallen into chaos or outright disintegrated. opening with the death of the then-king hanavanar at the hands of the assassin in white, the ensuing civil war has claimed the lives of all the veden highprinces, either through assassination or open warfare. the nominal victor of the war, valam, passed the veden crown to king taravangian of kharbranth, who has a claim to the throne through his mother. following the civil war, taravangian appointed two new highprinces to replace the ones lost. the two men are brothers, the elder of which is named nan urian. international relations[edit] as the largest country prior to the unification of alethkar, jah keved has strong influence on the culture of other vorin states. the centre of vorin church, the holy enclave, is located in the veden city of valath. valath is also the location of one of roshar's major spanreed hubs, adding to the city's importance. in the decades prior to the true desolation, jah keved fought a number of small border wars against alethkar. though they were initially pushed back out of alethi territory by forces led by dalinar kholin, the skirmishes and battles between veden and alethi highprinces continued for over a decade. despite that, the two kingdoms appear to have good diplomatic relations, and a marriage between their lighteyes isn't seen as anything out of the ordinary. military[edit] ""“ we talk of jah keved's weakness, but that’s relative. they still have a huge standing army, strong fortifications. if the enemy wades into jah keved now, while solidifying their own power, it will drain their resources and stall their conquest. ”- dalinar kholin on the veden military"" though not as militaristic as their eastern neighbors, jah keved is thought to possess the most shards of any country other than alethkar, including about twenty shardblades. prior to the civil war, each veden highprince maintained their own military. however, it appears that following taravangian's crowning, the surviving units have all been folded under his command. as the last battle was fought over vedenar, most of veden troops are stationed in storm bunkers at the city's outskirts. the civil war was catastrophic for them - many units suffered over 50% casualties - yet even with those losses the veden military boasts an enormous number of soldiers and powerful fortifications. entering their territory without sufficient preparations is generally considered to be a horrid idea bound to mire the potential assailant in years-long conflict, and a massive drain on resources. jah keved is known for their raiding tactics. the army operates in smaller raider groups, about four thousand strong, backed by a powerful main force. those raiders are highly mobile, capable of harrying the enemy while avoiding direct confrontation. their generals are noted to be excellent, even by alethi standards. a major focus of the veden strategy is the defense of the strip of land between horneater peaks and alethkar. though narrow and underpopulated, it's a verdant, rich land that can be used as a staging area for any invasion of jah keved. following the fall of central and northern alethkar to the voidbringers, large number of alethi soldiers withdrew to either jah keved or herdaz in hopes of escaping the flying fused. culture[edit] jah keved is comprised of at least four distinct ethnic groups - veden, siln, bav and unkalaki. veden[edit] ""“while your food sits well in my stomach, the amount of bowing and scraping you show ardents made me uncomfortable. ”-kabsal on the people of jah keved"" the veden people are typically associated with pale skin and violet eyes. their language belongs to the vorin family, and is close enough to that of alethkar to be mutually intelligible for both sides. the alethi are also close to vedens in fashion. the veden are by and large vorin, worshipping the almighty and the heralds. they appear to be more religious than average vorins, with higher importance being placed on the trappings of the faith, such as the safehand and the strict division between masculine and feminine arts. in particular, they are noted to be highly respectful and reverent of the ardents, and extremely traditional in the particulars of the doctrine. in veden families, the sons have two-part names, with the latter part being their given name, while the former references their order or birth. the first four sons are called nan, tet, asha and van. should one of the sons die or be disinherited, his younger brothers all move up a level; for example, tet balat becomes nan balat. the numerals are used mainly in formal context; siblings usually drop them when talking among themselves. when a veden couple marries, the spouses retain their family names. the children of the couple all use the surname of only one parent; it's unclear whether it's always the father's, or if it depends on the parents' relative dahns. siln and bav[edit] the siln people live in and around the southern city of silnasen. they are noted as being less technologically advanced than the rest of the country, with highly ritualized warfare. their apparent independence from veden rule may stem from the fact that they were once a sovereign city-state. the bav people live in bavland, a small region in the south-western corner of the country. they are mostly miners, and have their own language and culture largely separate from that of the veden. unkalaki[edit] the unkalaki - or horneaters, as they are called by outsiders - live on top of the mountains known as horneater peaks. they are one of several peoples with singer ancestry, and have some attributes that set them apart from other rosharan humans, such as their unusually strong teeth (which is where the ""horneater"" nickname comes from) and the ability to occasionally hear the rhythms. red hair is also a typically unkalaki feature, and are a mark of horneater ancestry on a person from outside the peaks. though the horneater peaks are nominally part of jah keved, the unkalaki have their own language, system of beliefs and government, and don't seem to see themselves as veden citizens. however, the veden still claim the right to levy troops from among them in times of war. notable citizens[edit] trivia[edit] - at 5.5 million square kilometres of land, jah keved is a little over half the size of the united states. - hid one of gavilar's - somewhere in jah keved. notes[edit]"
Melishi,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Melishi,"melishi is a historical knight radiant of the order of bondsmiths on roshar. attributes and abilities[edit] melishi was bonded to the sibling, which allowed him to use the surges of tension and adhesion. the sibling was exceptionally selective regarding their bonded human, and mentions taking years to find a human that fit them exactly. melishi can presumably utilize the surges similarly to others of his order. for example, the stormfather says that melishi was able to see the connections between people as dalinar does. he also seems to be an expert regarding fabrials, based on the nature of urithiru and the protections he put in place for the sibling. history[edit] ""“[melishi] could make no specific account of his process; it was related to the very nature of the heralds and their divine duties, an attribute the bondsmiths alone could address. ”-words of radiance, chapter 30, page 18"" melishi is thought to have lived several thousand years ago, and was likely the only bondsmith of his generation. like the other radiants, he fought against the voidbringers during the false desolation; the book words of radiance stated that he was determined to destroy them using abilities unique to the bondsmith order. his plan was related to the nature of the heralds and he was not able to fully explain it to the other orders of radiants. the urithiru gem archive held some additional details about melishi's plan. melishi and other scholar radiants of the time believed that the unmade ba-ado-mishram had connected to the parsh and was supplying them with voidlight, facilitating their forms of power. the radiants intended to capture ba-ado-mishram using melishi's abilities and a perfect gemstone, denying them voidlight and thus bringing the war to an end. however, naze-daughter-kuzodo was concerned about the unintended side effects of melishi's actions. the specific outcome of melishi's plan is not known, but the events surrounding this conflict are believed to be the basis of the legendary false desolation. sylphrena comments to kaladin that when the parsh were ""conquered"", their connection and identity were damaged, creating what was known as ""slaveform"" for several millennia. ""“i hate humans. humans twist what is said and always make themselves out to be right. how long until you demand that i bond a human, give up my freedom, and risk my life? i'm sure you’ll have wonderful explanations as to why i should absolutely do that. ”-the sibling, to navani"" melishi is also the creator of the barrier surrounding the sibling's pillar at the heart of urithiru, which is powered by four gemstone nodes throughout the tower. the stormfather refers to the sibling being hurt by humanity in the past and the sibling expresses significant bitterness towards melishi, blaming him for their loss of freedom and risking their life. the sibling also had an aversion to fabrials since they involved imprisoning spren. however, at least some of melishi's actions proved necessary to protect the sibling and urithiru from invasion. the sibling somehow knew to end their bond with melishi voluntarily before the recreance so they would not become a deadeye, and they swore to never bond another human, only reluctantly bonding navani out of necessity. notes[edit]"
Visions,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Visions,"""spook: ""what is this?"" kelsier: ""half dream."" spook: ""half dream?"" kelsier: ""you’re almost dead, kid. smashed your spirit up pretty good. lots of cracks. that let me in."" ―"" visions are a partially spiritual partially cognitive phenomena that shards and some invested individuals can induce. characteristics & attributes[edit] realms[edit] visions are almost like glimpsing into the spiritual realm, but viewed through the cognitive realm. this is done by a person being pulled through the realms into the spiritual realm, with the cognitive realm adding framework to seeds set in place. this allows the person to interact with the vision, and for the vision to respond, similar to an ai. almost anything can be shown in a vision. visions can also be used for meetings, creating a near empty void just for communicating with others. visions may be a type of pocket dimension in the spiritual realm and are considered a warping of the realms. due to this, time may slow in the physical realm when a vision is occurring. visions do not change the past or create alternate timelines. creation[edit] ""dalinar: ""this place is where you make the visions happen, isn’t it? time sometimes moved oddly in those."" stormfather: ""yes. but you must have connection for a vision. you must have a reason for it. a meaning. it cannot be just anything."" ―"" those with the ability are able to induce visions on their targets. in order to bring a person into a vision, a strong connection must be made. this may require a conduit (such as the everstorm, highstorm, or access via someone else connected to them) if the connection between the two is not strong enough. for shards, targeting lone individuals requires a high level of connection. mechanics[edit] those pulled into a vision have little control over it and often can't refuse. however, they may be able to pull in those they are bonded with. those pulled into a vision manifest via their mind and soul, ignoring physical aliments. some visions can be slowed down, similar to the effects of a speed bubble. those who a brought into a vision can bring some things with them (such as the thrill, surgebinding, or nightblood), though some things cannot be brought (such as shardblades). things affected in a vision will carry over after exiting one, such as paper being torn in a vision remaining torn after leaving the vision. likewise, some entities inside a vision can still be harmed or killed. accents might not carry over inside of visions. interference[edit] some individuals are able to control the visions of others, entering, leaving, and removing others on their own without the creators authority. they can also be messed with under certain inhibitors, such as suppression fabrials. honor's visions[edit] honor, via the stormfather, sent visions to both gavilar and dalinar during every highstorm. these visions feel real to them, and they experienced them as themselves, but other people in the visions see them as someone else, not as an outsider. at the end of every one of them, they hear the voice of honor speaking to them, commanding them to ""unite them."" as the visions are pre-recorded, they cannot communicate with honor. they were selected to see these visions as part of being on the path of becoming a bondsmith. after bonding with the stormfather, dalinar was able to control and chose who experiences the visions and able to bring other people into the visions with him. odium's visions[edit] odium can bring others into vision, which he used often to communicate with them directly. when used for communication, odium typically creates a vast field of golden light and stone. notably, odium was demonstrated to be vulnerable during his visions, allowing him to be slayed by nightblood. this shattered the vision, leaving a dark void, within which taravangian was able to ascend to the shard of odium. preservation's visions[edit] kelsier, as preservation, was able to pull a semi-comatose spook into a ""half dream"" of how the world once was to communicate vital information to spook about how to defeat ruin. renarin's visions[edit] renarin is able to show a person an alternate version of themselves, similar to the effect of allomantic gold or malatium. this manifests as an illusory image of the target's alternate self standing within a cloud of bright white light. notes[edit]"
Drunmu Basin,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Drunmu_Basin,"the drunmu basin is a region in southern emul on roshar. it was contested by odium's forces and the coalition of monarchs during the true desolation. geography and ecology[edit] the basin is vast, and encompasses a large portion of emul's southern territory along its borders with tukar and marat. the eastern end of the basin reaches the foot of the mountains of ur. the basin is largely flat, although it has some small hills and slopes. rosharan grass covers most of the ground; pilevines also flourish in the area, growing quite tall. history[edit] emul sustained significant damage towards the end of the eighty's war] and after the awakening of the singers through the everstorm. although the basin did not contain significant population centers, its location along the emul-tukar border made it strategically significant; tezim's armies were stationed in the area. within a few months of the battle of narak, the singers under odium's control took over much of emul's territory, including the basin. the emuli sought assistance from the nascent coalition of monarchs. by chach 1175, coalition forces had recaptured some of emul's territory. the fighting came to a standstill; the coalition army was well-supplied but did not push into the basin since they were still wary of ishar's army in marat. the coalition turned to dieno enne calah to lead their military strategy. the mink decided to mount an offensive in emul, reasoning that the singer army would try to make a stand at this location, but the coalition would still be able to defeat them. this would improve morale and allow the coalition to stabilize makabak, and was more sensible than an assault on the enemy stronghold in alethkar. the emuli conflict culminated in a series of large battles on the plains of the basin. the singer forces numbered around forty thousand including fused and regals, while dalinar supplemented the azish forces in the area with reserves from urithiru and various knights radiant. jasnah decided to personally participate in the battle to better understand the nature of war. this was the first battle in which she participated as a soldier. the fighting was intense, with thousands of casualties on both sides. the coalition forces were ultimately victorious and took control of emul, although the mink and dalinar recognized that odium had not thrown all of his resources at retaining it. dalinar then used the basin as the starting point of his journey to visit ishar's camp. hoid was in the basin when he realized that a sleepless aligned with the ghostbloods had been spying on him. notes[edit]"
Hauka,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Hauka,"hauka is an azish guard captain on roshar. she lives in the tashikki city of yeddaw and oversees immigration into the city. she interacts with lift and nale when they come to yeddaw. appearance and personality[edit] she wears a typical azish guard uniform, including boots, trousers, a cap, and a breastplate. she also wears a cape with her family and study patterns on them. hauka is dedicated and pragmatic, and shares the common azish trait of appreciating bureaucracy. she keeps fastidious records in her guard logbook and always completes necessary paperwork, although she does not necessarily enjoy explaining unusual events. she does not show weakness in front of her subordinates. she likes to read at night and is willing to trade information for infused spheres. attributes and abilities[edit] hauka has certified credentials of achievement that make her eligible to be an officer in any guard unit in greater makabaki, although she is not approved to be a battlefield commander. she carries a spear and a club, but only uses them as a last resort. she is observant, and is able to detect deception by merchants entering the city. she is agile enough to briefly catch lift. history[edit] hauka was stationed at a small guard post at the entrance to yeddaw, one of the few buildings built above the trenches that make up the city. her post is near the city's immigrant quarter. she oversaw at least two guards, including rez, and often worked with a scribe named nissiqqan. she left her post at exactly ten o'clock every day when she was relieved by the night watch captain, and she visited the grand indicium weekly for debriefing sessions. her home was close to her guard post, in a relatively affordable apartment complex just outside of the immigrant quarter. discovering lift and meeting nale[edit] in jes 1174, hauka and nissiqqan deduced that a tallew merchant entering the city had likely stolen the grain from abandoned fields in war-torn emul. as she inspected the goods, she discovered lift hiding in the grain. hauka attempted to apprehend her, but after a brief altercation, lift ultimately dumped the grain into the city and escaped using her edgedancer abilities. the merchant filed suit against the city guard claiming neglect of duty, although his case was weak. ""“could you tell me what’s going on here? i feel lost, like a soldier on a battlefield who can’t remember which banner is hers.”-hauka to nale, after her initial encounter with lift"" lift later revealed to wyndle that she had intentionally displayed her powers because she knew an azish guard such as hauka would write a report about it. this would draw nale's attention, and lift could then observe him. lift's plan worked, and she watched nale visit hauka at home to question her regarding the encounter. hauka admitted that she had seen lift glowing and becoming unusually slippery. hauka felt very confused by what had happened, but nale declined to share any information with her. he ordered her to keep an eye out for lift. working with lift[edit] hauka issued a citywide watch for lift, and ghenna contacted the guard when lift tried to enter the grand indicium. hauka happened to be nearby for her weekly debriefing session, and once again attempted to apprehend lift, cornering her. however, a nearby spanreed received a message from azimir confirming lift's claims that she was operating under the authority of prime aqasix yanagawn. hauka then began helping lift search for a surgebinder by reviewing records of any recent unexplained events in the city. hauka gave lift some information regarding unusual activity that the city guard had observed at tashi's light orphanage, and told her that arshqqam would soon be arrested on money-laundering charges. their research was cut short when the everstorm approached the city and the prince gave an edict to seek shelter, overruling yanagawn's orders. lift recalled hauka's words about feeling lost after talking to arclo and questioning her purpose. she felt she owed hauka a debt for using her in her plot to draw out nale. when lift left the city, she saw hauka dealing with a large number of refugees who had lost homes to the everstorm. lift tossed her a smashed pancake from her pocket as payment for her debt. a stunned hauka then watched lift briefly use her healing powers on the refugees. notes[edit]"

Ua'pam,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ua%27pam,"ua'pam is a peakspren on roshar bonded to zu. appearance and personality[edit] as a peakspren, ua'pam has the appearance of a featureless humanoid rock in the physical realm; he can change his size, and can sometimes be as small as a pebble. he can disappear into stone and emerge from it later. in shadesmar, ua'pam resembles a tall human made of rock; he is reminiscent of a mountain. he is bald and has human features. his skin has cracks that glow from within as if molten, although it is not actually hot to the touch. he wears fur-lined clothing. ua'pam doesn't speak much, and he has a ""grinding"" voice. he sometimes audibly rubs his knuckles together, but the meaning of the gesture is unknown. he is serious and cautious, although he prefers to confront problems rather than run from them. he considers kasiden peakspren from the east to be fools. attributes and abilities[edit] ua'pam shares a nahel bond with zu, granting him sapience in the physical realm. zu is able to manifest ua'pam as a shardblade; she prefers a very long, thin, curved blade, but she actively changes its shape as needed. ua'pam is able to manifest objects in shadesmar. he has the rare ability to sense the soul of an object, although he can only get a somewhat indistinct perception of its nature. to manifest the object in the cognitive realm, he takes the corresponding bead in shadesmar and uses inhaled stormlight to make it reflect its physical nature; doing so seems to be physically taxing. when the object appears in the cognitive realm, he can sometimes be surprised by its particular characteristics. ua'pam is particularly skilled with this process, more so than his cousin unativi. his manifestations can last a long time, even without any reinfusion of stormlight. he is also familiar with mandra-powered transportation in shadesmar, and knows how to help unativi prepare his barge for flight. he has a relatively high level of familiarity with the geography of shadesmar, including some caravan routes. history[edit] ua'pam bonded zu circa 1173; he joined the fight with the radiants because odium was coming and he did not want to run. zu's newfound powers led to her exile from iri, as it was not widely known at the time that surgebinding had returned. he presumably accompanied zu during her time in the reshi isles over the next few years. in 1175, ua'pam and zu were selected by the coalition of monarchs to join the diplomatic mission from urithiru to the honorspren stronghold of lasting integrity. the team entered shadesmar through an oathgate, and it was the first time zu saw ua'pam's form in the cognitive realm. ua'pam was happy to see his cousin unativi, who captained the barge that the group took from nohadon's stairways to nameless. notably, ua'pam and unativi did not agree on the best course of action for their people in the face of the true desolation, demonstrating that spren did not act as a monolith. ua'pam participated in scouting activities with zu, and helped find places to camp during the journey. he discouraged zu from confronting the tukari caravan and their leader. upon reaching lasting integrity, zu was part of the group that was sent back to urithiru to bring word to dalinar, and ua'pam presumably went with her. relationships[edit] zu[edit] he has a strong, playful relationship with zu. she shows affection towards him, and enjoys antagonizing him by ignoring his admonitions to be more careful. adolin kholin[edit] during the expedition to lasting integrity, ua'pam befriended adolin kholin. although he was surprised by mayalaran's ability to perform katas, he refused to believe that she was regaining her mind, insisting that it was impossible. he later told adolin about the beautiful views from one of the caravan routes, and advised him of a spot where starspren are visible. notes[edit]"
Spark,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Spark,"spark is an ashspren on roshar who is bonded to malata. she and malata are part of the diagram organization. appearance and personality[edit] shallan could see no sign of spark when meeting malata, nor has there been any information given concerning her appearance. spark likes to break things; like other ashspren, she wants to know what is inside. she does not like the term ""dustbringer"", which is the name commonly used for the radiant order that bonds to ashspren, and may prefer the name ""releaser"". this may be partially due to the similarity of ""dustbringer"" to ""voidbringer"". ""“spark is game for whatever it takes to get vengeance. and what lets her break stuff. ”-malata"" spark blames the knights radiant and their devotion to honor for the killing of hundreds of ashspren and is seeking vengeance. malata also expresses skepticism about the radiants. taravangian questions spark's willingness to help the diagram with certain activities that may contradict the desires of other spren, but malata assures him that spark is resolute in her convictions. abilities[edit] nahel bond[edit] through her nahel bond with malata, spark gains increased sapience in the physical realm and presumably an increased ability to manifest a physical form. the bond also allows malata to bind the surges of division and abrasion. the surge of abrasion presumably allows malata to manipulate friction, although she has not been seen using this power. she has been seen using division, which can cause objects (even living things) to degrade, burn, or turn to dust. the powers of dustbringers have been referred to as ""dreadful"" and pattern seems to believe that they inevitably start destroying things. malata is also able to summon spark as a shardblade. spark's shardblade form is likely similar to other blades on roshar since dalinar sees it on several occasions and does not comment on its appearance. malata is able to use spark as a shardblade to operate the oathgates. history[edit] ""“never mind what the radiants did to spark’s friends, never mind that organized devotion to honor is what killed hundreds of ashspren in the first place.”-malata to taravangian on betraying dalinar and the radiants"" according to the diagram, dustbringers were the radiants most likely to accept the group's cause. taravangian searched the diagram's ranks for someone who could bond an ashspren and felt fortunate to have discovered malata. after malata bonded spark, she was suddenly elevated from a lower rank into the upper echelon of the organization. malata maintained that she and spark were not beholden to taravangian. she claimed that spark suggested working with him as a convenient way to see the newly-rediscovered city of urithiru. once at urithiru, spark and malata seemed to be working with dalinar and the coalition. spark was used to open the oathgates more and more often. however, spark was secretly spying on dalinar and was responsible for finding out about other visions that dalinar had not shared with everyone. tidbits of information recovered by spark helped taravangian with his accusations of treason that led to the collapse of dalinar's coalition. spark and malata were conspicuously absent during the battle of thaylen field. since malata had been tasked with operating the oathgates, teshav mentioned their absence as the reason that additional alethi forces could not reach the city. additionally, the diagram sent a strike force of singers to urithiru, although it is not confirmed whether or not spark and malata allowed them passage through an oathgate. relationships[edit] malata[edit] spark's relationship with malata is only known through malata's comments regarding spark to other people. spark and malata seem to collaborate with each other; malata notes that sometimes spark makes suggestions on their course of action, while at other points spark seems to do things at malata's request. spark has recounted the events of the recreance to malata, who expresses empathy regarding spark´s pain and resentment towards the radiants. malata also seems to gain confidence after bonding spark. taravangian believes that spark's self-awareness will grow the longer that she is bonded to malata, and that her personality may change as a result. notes[edit]"

and a cloth tied around her chest. she also wears the patterned shoulder cloak of a marabethian high judge. ki is a calm and orderly woman who is well-suited to the skybreakers. she is appreciative of skill and thoroughness, seeking to make those hopefuls that impress her into her squires. she also seemed to have a decent sense of humor, seemingly amused by szeth's assertion that he had won the lashing drill because of a loophole. she is also reverent of nale and obedient to his orders. attributes and abilities[edit] as a skybreaker of the fourth ideal, ki has access to the surges of gravitation and division. this allows her the ability to make use of the basic and reverse lashings, as well as the ability to degrade objects. she also has the ability to take in stormlight, allowing her to recover from all but the most severe of injuries. she also almost certainly has access to a shardblade, although this has not been confirmed. history[edit] early life[edit] at some point in her life, ki was recruited to the skybreakers. she eventually bonded the highspren winnow. after years of training and the completion of some sort of personal quest, ki swore the first four ideals of the skybreakers, reaching the rank of master. she operated out of the skybreaker fortress near the purelake and seems to have primarily worked as a trainer to nascent skybreakers. training hopefuls[edit] in 1174, one evening after szeth arrived at the skybreakers' fortress, winnow proclaimed to ki during her prayers that the highspren were already watching him. the next day, when szeth began his training with the skybreakers, ki administered the first ideal to him and the other hopefuls, leading them through speaking the words. she also pardoned the trainees for any past violations of the law or misdeeds. after the ceremony, szeth asked her if she had sworn the fifth ideal herself. ki explained to him and the others that the fifth ideal had not been achieved in centuries and that only the third ideal was required to become a full skybreaker. she then explained all five skybreaker ideals to them. szeth also asked her why he was training with the other new initiates when nale had treated him differently. ki explained that nale had believed that szeth might achieve the third ideal immediately due to his past, but in the herald's absence szeth would have to start from the beginning. she lashed szeth into the sky as the skybreakers moved the hopefuls to the location of their test. when the skybreakers arrived at the marabethian town where the test was to take place, szeth asked ki several questions about the escaped prisoners they had been charged to apprehend. she explained that the city's high minister, kwati, had written the skybreakers asking for aid to apprehend these escaped murderous criminals. she told szeth that they had received writs ordering their deaths and his task was to apprehend an execute the escapees. ki also told him that the reason they had not been previously executed is that the local reshi culture was typically non-violent. ki also asked szeth why he walked on stone, as she had never seen another shin break that prohibition. szeth told her that if stone was truly holy, it would have killed him long ago. while the test occurred, the city's high minister tried to make small talk with ki, with limited success. after szeth had ascertained that the high minister had mistreated the prisoners, he asked ki if they had a writ for this man's execution. ki told him that it was the first one they obtained, and szeth executed the man with nightblood and knelt before ki. despite being shocked by the effects of nightblood, she praised szeth and gave him her canteen to sate his thirst. afterwards, ki decided to take szeth as her squire and debated with the other skybreakers for the privilege. she won the argument and took szeth as her squire after he swore the second ideal. she also answered szeth's questions about why the skybreakers had not acted earlier against the corrupt high minister, explaining that he had not violated a law until he had failed at his responsibility to hold the prisoners. szeth's master[edit] when the skybreaker squires performed the lashing combat drill with the powdered bags, ki was also present. she shared a look with warren when szeth claimed he had technically won the contest as the waters of the purelake had washed his uniform clean of powder. ki was impressed by the skill szeth had displayed in the drill, as she had not realized how practiced he was with lashings. when nale interrupted their conversation, ordering that the skybreakers accompany him on a journey, ki asked if nale intended them to leave that very night, to which nale responded affirmatively. ki accompanied szeth and nale and most of the other skybreakers on their journey to marat, flying southward for three days. upon their arrival in marat, she landed and conferred briefly with nale and the other masters before flying to a nearby town with all the skybreakers except for szeth and nale. notes[edit]"
Phendorana,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Phendorana,"""“life breaks us, teft. then we fill the cracks with something stronger. ”-phendorana"" phendorana is an honorspren on roshar. she has some level of importance or authority among her kind. she bonded teft during the true desolation. appearance and personality[edit] in the physical realm, phendorana takes the form of a human-sized older woman with long hair. this is noticeably larger than other honorspren such as rua and sylphrena, who usually appear to be about a handspan tall. her clothing initially looks like an elegant gown, but after bonding a windrunner she is seen in a practical thaylen-style skirt and blouse. her hair moves as if blown by a phantom wind, and curls and disappears into mist. although she is not seen in the cognitive realm, she presumably has a similar appearance there. teft describes phendorana as tenacious and a bit cantankerous, although she also has a warm side. syl vaguely recalls phendorana reprimanding her when she was searching for kaladin, implying that phendorana has a leadership role among the honorspren. lopen says that phendorana sometimes lectures her fellow honorspren. attributes and abilities[edit] like other honorspren, phendorana is a splinter of honor. she has minimal substance in the physical realm, and glows with a blue-white light. she is able to change her form at will; although she prefers to be human-sized, she sometimes becomes smaller for convenience. she can float above the ground rather than walking on it. she can choose to be visible or invisible to humans, with a few exceptions such as lunamor. she is also able to form a nahel bond, increasing her sentience in the physical realm and granting a bonded human abilities of the order of windrunners, including the surges of adhesion and gravitation. she can speak directly into the mind of her bonded radiant. history[edit] according to notum, all of the honorspren except for syl became deadeyes on the day of recreance. the stormfather created ten more honorspren after several hundred years of mourning, and phendorana was either among those ten spren or was descended from them. post-recreance[edit] syl recounted getting into trouble with phendorana and the other honorspren when she started seeking kaladin, as spren had generally shied away from the nahel bond since the recreance. it is likely that phendorana was aware of a large reward that had been offered for syl's capture and return to lasting integrity. after kaladin and other humans began bonding spren once again, syl believed that phendorana decided to ignore her because she did not want to admit that she was wrong. observing the refounded windrunners[edit] in 1174, lunamor noticed phendorana watching the windrunner squires and hopefuls of bridge four training on the shattered plains. lunamor was the only person who saw her, due to his ability as a sighted, or alaii'iku, that allowed him to see spren that were invisible to other people. she was surrounded by several dozen smaller honorspren, more than lunamor had ever seen in one place. lunamor referred to phendorana as ""ali'i'kamura"", the most important god present; he had previously mentioned ali'i'kamura as a god that could offer protection from danger. he asked sylphrena if phendorana was similar to an unkalaki clan leader called a nuatoma, and she replied ""kind of maybe sort of halfway"". lunamor tried to think of a suitable offering, and ruled out bread and stew. he eventually approached phendorana with a bowl full of stormlight-infused spheres. phendorana regarded him, then put her hand over the bowl and drew out the stormlight before departing as a ribbon of light. nahel bond[edit] phendorana chose to bond teft at some point after she had observed the windrunners practicing on the shattered plains. she was first seen accompanying him in urithiru prior to the battle of thaylen field. she reminded him that he still had more progress to make swearing the immortal words. due to his ongoing shame regarding his firemoss addiction, teft resisted her support, and was hesitant to reveal their bond to the rest of bridge four. teft panicked after learning that selling his bridge four uniform had contributed to eth's death, but phendorana refused to abandon him and instead encouraged him to live up to his oaths. this led to teft swearing the third ideal of the windrunners, allowing phendorana to become a living shardspear. after teft swore the third ideal, he revealed phendorana's presence to the other knights radiant, although she generally preferred to remain hidden from sight. lopen was aware that phendorana had authority among honorspren and wondered if she was behind the failure of his previous attempts to swear the ideal using the same wording as kaladin and teft. lopen was later able to swear the third ideal after experiencing personal growth, implying that phendorana was not to blame for the delay. power inhibition and death[edit] when raboniel was able to partially block the powers of the knights radiant, teft was incapacitated and phendorana disappeared from the physical realm; she could not be sensed by syl. after teft was revived, he had difficulty summoning phendorana and she had no memory of what had happened. like other windrunners, teft could not use the surge of gravitation, and phendorana could not become a shardweapon. phendorana was present when moash ambushed lift and teft during their attempt to rescue the unconscious radiants. teft and phendorana were able to briefly overcome the tower's obstruction of their bond to form a shardspear and block a strike from moash's honorblade. however, this left both of them drained, and as they recovered, moash produced one of the fused's soul-stealing daggers armed with newly-discovered anti-stormlight; raboniel originally intended for the dagger to be used on syl, but moash had refused to confront kaladin. moash attacked phendorana directly with the dagger, using white sand to detect her location and stabbing her in the head. phendorana was shocked, and then writhed in pain as her essence seemed to burn and explode outward, permanently destroying her. teft experienced a ripping sensation in his soul upon her death; he was distraught, but remained hopeful as he was also killed by moash. ""“it hurt so much. agony like a sudden terrible stillness. nothingness. emptiness. ”-teft, on phendorana's death"" a sculpture of phendorana was commissioned after her death so that it could be placed next to teft's body, which was soulcast into stone. her soul was not destroyed, and could have reached the beyond. relationships[edit] teft[edit] teft struggled with firemoss addiction for years, and felt that he did not deserve a spren bond even as his fellow bridgemen gained powers. after phendorana bonded teft, they had conversations about his childhood trauma and history with the envisagers. phendorana understands teft's tendency towards self-loathing like no one else, and her ""crusty"" personality matches his very well. she does not suffer excuses and is able to push him when he needs it, but she can also offer support, encouragement, and affirmations of his worth. the two also share lighter moments, and teft thinks she looks like a little child when she grins. notes[edit]"
Rua,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rua,"""“""storm you!"" lopen made a double obscene gesture toward the sky...rua joined him, making the same gesture, then grew two extra arms to give it more weight. ”-lopen teaching rua a rude gesture"" rua is an honorspren on roshar. he bonded lopen and they together belong to bridge four. appearance and personality[edit] rua appears to lopen as a ribbon of light, a young boy of nine or ten years or as a young man. one of his favorite forms is a flying chull with broad wings. lopen calls him naco. he likes to play hide-and-seek with lopen, whose carefree attitude meshes well with the spren. he is mischievous like a windspren. he appears to be incapable of speech, though lopen seems to understand more complex meanings from his gestures. attributes and abilities[edit] as an honorspren, forming a nahel bond with rua made lopen a knight radiant of the order of windrunners. through their bond, lopen is able to access the surges of gravitation and adhesion, and after lopen reaches his third ideal, rua is able to form a shardblade. history[edit] rua seems to have begun investigating lopen for a potential nahel bond sometime between the battle of narak and the battle of thaylen field. lopen then swore the first ideal sometime before the battle of thaylen field and swore the second ideal shortly after the battle, while talking to a wounded soldier. rua, who is nicknamed naco by lopen, plays with him at the war camps where the wounded are being cared for. he is still at the beginning of his consciousness. when lopen teaches rua how to make a rude gesture, the spren proceeds to use it indiscriminately, once even growing an extra pair of arms to make a quadruple rude gesture towards the stormfather himself. rua travelled with lopen to akinah, and even showed himself to rysn at one point during the voyage. he also helped lopen detect and keep track of turlm when the sailor was washed overboard. for the duration of the storm and until they reached the shore, rua watched the ocean for and kept track of a shadow, later revealed to be a specialised sleepless hordeling, that followed the wandersail as they approached akinah, and continued to follow the rowboat they took to shore. rua was concerned for lopen when he was injured fighting the specialised hordelings defending akinah. after the battle, rua helped lopen swear his third ideal and became a shardblade for the first time, including an engraving of rua making a rude gesture as soon as lopen considers it. relationships[edit] lopen[edit] ""“life before death, strength before weakness, journey before pancakes. ”-lopen’s first oath, where he bonds rua."" rua and lopen have a good time together as they play hide and seek or make gestures to other people, but when things get serious rua is genuinely worried about lopen when injured. rua follows and imitates lopen. rua knows that lopen sometimes unintentionally hurts people with his jokes, and helped him acknowledge that and swear his third ideal. phendorana[edit] lopen asks if it's phendorana's fault that he hasn't sworn the third ideal, implying rua listens to her, specifically when it comes to oaths. huio[edit] rua cheered for huio when he swore his third ideal during the battle on akinah; he was excited and happy about huio progressing in his bond with caelinora. sylphrena[edit] syl believes rua to be the only other honorspren like her, curious and mischievous like a windspren, indicating that they likely know each other in some capacity. notes[edit]"
Order of Stonewards,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Stonewards,"the order of stonewards is an order of the knights radiant on roshar. the stonewards were surgebinders who used the surges of cohesion and tension, and they are associated with the topaz polestone. the patron herald of the stonewards is talenel. in shadesmar, the spren of the stonewards, peakspren, look like stone and their skin cracks when they move. philosophy[edit] those who join the stonewards generally subscribe to a philosophy of team dynamics, on learning to work with others, and on being there for those who need them. the core tenet of the order is be there when needed. they seek to take a difficult situation with few resources and make something better of it. the order strives to exemplify resolve, strength, and dependability. they tend to attract those who are most interested in warfare, prowess with weapons, or athletics of any sort. ideals of the stonewards[edit] the ideals of the knights radiant, also known as the immortal words, are a set of rules by which the radiants live. the first ideal is shared by all of the orders, and is used as a motto for the knights radiant as a whole. each of the orders then have an additional four ideals that are unique to that order. the ideals of the order of stonewards all focus on working with a team and supporting others, which led them to put others' interests before their own. of the orders, they were some of the least likely to bend their ideals. the first ideal[edit] ""“life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination ”-the first ideal of the knights radiant"" the second ideal[edit] a possible second ideal for stonewards is ""i will stand where others fall"". abilities[edit] ""“the shardbearer pressed his hand against the incline leading up to the voidbringer, and again the stone seemed to writhe. steps formed in the rock, as if it were made of wax that could flow and be shaped. ”-dalinar's observations of a stoneward in a vision"" the stonewards use the surges of cohesion and tension. like most knights radiant, the stonewards have squires. cohesion[edit] cohesion allows them to manipulate or alter objects at a molecular level. their exact powers are so far unknown, but they are able to reshape stone to some extent. this ability lets them reshape things other than stone, but not flesh or anything even slightly invested. tension[edit] tension allows them to alter the stiffness of an object. stonewards are able to control the hardness of an object, allowing them to harden clothing into weapons, and have the ability to shape stone at their will. much like cohesion, tension is highly resisted by investiture. shardplate abilities[edit] the glow of their shardplate is amber. history[edit] the ancient stonewards were the infantry and the ground troops of the knights radiant; alongside the windrunners, they were considered the finest soldiers. they tended to attract people interested in warfare, but also challenge, prowess with weapons, and athleticism. throughout the world, they were widely known for being dependable, strong and filled with resolve, but also stubborn to a fault and prone to taking on projects larger than themselves. this attitude was said to be a good representation of their patron herald. they took pride in this -- to be there when they were needed was a core tenet of their order. in battle, they served as the frontline troops. in times of peace, on the other hand, they were often explorers, but also sportsmen, often organizing and engaging in various competitions and events. notable stonewards[edit] - (bonded to - ) - (bonded to an unknown peakspren) - was a historic stoneward from before the - . quotes[edit] ""“now, as each order was thus matched to the nature and temperament of the herald it named patron, there was none more archetypal of this than the stonewards, who followed after talenelat'elin, stonesinew, herald of war: they thought it a point of virtue to exemplify resolve, strength, and dependability. alas, they took less care for imprudent practice of their stubbornness, even in the face of proven error. ”-words of radiance, chapter 13, page 1"" ""“as a stoneward, i spent my entire life looking to sacrifice myself. i secretly worry that this is the cowardly way. the easy way out. - from drawer 29-5, topaz. ”-oathbringer, chapter 58, epigraph"" notes[edit]"
Microkinesis,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Microkinesis,"microkinesis is a manifestation of investiture originating on yolen. magic[edit] microkinesis grants the power to manipulate the forces that bind axi together. axi are thought to be the smallest units of matter in the cosmere, although there may be particles that are even smaller. a practitioner of microkinesis is able to see individual axi and interact with them. the manipulation of axial forces can be ""explosive"" and incredibly dangerous. only odium is also known to be able to perceive matter at the axial level, although it is likely that other shards also have this ability based on their ability to manipulate matter; for example, vin as preservation was able to remove the ash from scadrial's atmosphere almost instantly. it is not known how the power of microkinesis is granted or accessed, or what races or individuals can use it. according to khriss, microkinesis is a sort of ""cousin"" to the surge of cohesion, as both can manipulate a force known as the strong axial interconnection that holds all matter together. microkinesis has more sheer power than cohesion, as honor placed limits on cohesion in order to avoid replicating an unknown harmful event on yolen. however, microkinesis does not grant the same connection to the shaped material that cohesion does. it is not clear whether or not microkinesis can also manipulate the axial force related to the surge of tension known as soft axial interconnection. history[edit] microkinesis is one of the oldest magics in the cosmere, as it predates the shattering of adonalsium. its origins and any wielders are unknown; the only time it is known to have been used was during some unspecified ""mistakes"" on yolen that were presumably disastrous. the original vessels were very cautious regarding the danger of microkinesis, as honor took its power into account during the creation of surgebinding. trivia[edit] - microkinesis was one of the first magic systems that brandon designed for the cosmere - and it is discussed in - . however, it was far too powerful in its original form. - various aspects of the magic have therefore not been canonized, but its existence has always remained canon, - and it will presumably feature in the rewritten - novels. - axi are analogous to atoms, - and microkinesis was inspired by - , including the - and - between subatomic particles. however, brandon intentionally used invented terms for these concepts in the cosmere in order to give himself more freedom with the mechanics of the magic. - brandon has not decided if microkinesis or another canonical magic system will be able to split axi into smaller particles. - another aspect of microkinesis that has not been canonized is the ability to manipulate - . notes[edit]"
Oathgate,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Oathgates,"""“within a heartbeat, alezarv was there, crossing a distance that would have taken more than four months to travel by foot. ”-among the darkeyed, page 102"" the oathgates are structures on roshar that allow people to instantaneously teleport from one location to another. there are twenty in total, with ten located in urithiru, while the other ten sit in various cities across the continent. functionality[edit] oathgates are fabrials that manipulate the surge of transportation. together, they form a network of gateways with urithiru at its center, allowing for near-instantaneous travel between all corners of the world, and letting people unable to fly access to the tower-city itself. they can only be operated by someone wielding a living shardblade, such as a knight radiant, or with an honorblade. they require stormlight to work, although they can be made to use voidlight through methods known to odium's forces. transportation of more than one person requires more stormlight than what the oathgate can normally hold in its ten gemstone lanterns. the amount of stormlight needed also depends on the radiant, as those of higher oaths require less to activate the fabrial. a radiant can use their shardblade to travel to the cognitive realm instead of another oathgate. structure and operation[edit] oathgates can be found in many of the oldest cities on roshar, such as kholinar and stormseat. each of them is composed of a large, perfectly circular platform, with a round control building in its center. the entire oathgate is typically at a higher altitude than the rest of the city, with a wide ramp leading up to it. in some places, the ramp is also accompanied by a staircase, although that could be a later addition to the structure. control building[edit] the inside of the control building is richly decorated in murals both on the walls and the floor. the latter is divided into eleven sections, with the ten major ones each dedicated to one of the silver kingdoms. between the first and tenth segments is a smaller, narrow section representing urithiru. the wall above has ten gemstone lamps hanging from it, with each lamp being enclosed in a metal lattice. once they are infused, the floor begins to glow, and swirls of stormlight start rising above the platform outside. along with the lamps, on the wall there is a plate of metal, shaped like a ten-pointed star, with a slot in its center. when a shardblade is inserted, the slot reshapes to fit its particular form. this occurs regardless of whether the blade is living or dead, but only a living blade or honorblade can activate the keyhole, at which point is produces a low, vibrating sound. once the blade is in the keyhole, the keyhole can be moved along with the entire inner wall to align it with one of the eleven floor sections. there, the radiant removes the shardblade from the keyhole. with this, the contents of the control chamber, as well as anything on top of the platform, is swapped with the control chamber and the platform of the oathgate in the desired location. the control building can also be swapped by itself, without transporting the platform, taking considerably less stormlight than moving the entire platform. the existence of eleven lamps in each oathgate control chamber indicates that it might be possible to transport people directly between any two platforms. however, at the present each oathgate is tied only to one other, connecting each of the ten ancient cities to urithiru. locking the oathgate[edit] each oathgate can be locked from either side. odium appears to have a way to break this lock, which could be tied to his corruption of kholinar oathgate spren. all but the stormseat oathgate have been locked up by the ancient knights radiant when they abandoned the tower city. as such, over the millennia since the recreance, their purpose has been forgotten. many of the oathgate platforms are covered in buildings, such as the grand market in azimir, or the kholinar palace in kholinar. others, like the one in thaylen city, have been transformed into gardens and other religious or ceremonial structures. shadesmar[edit] in shadesmar, an oathgate is represented by a flat platform of a material akin to white marble, the size of the control building. when possible -- for example, if the oathgate is close to the sea shore in the physical realm -- the oathgate is connected with the land by a bridge of matching color. the platform itself is watched over by a pair of enormous spren, both the size of buildings, each wearing a set of armor and holding a spear. one of the spren is white, while the other is shimmering black. those two spren enable the oathgate to function properly, and control who can travel, and where. they can be corrupted by sja-anat, although so far, only the kholinar spren have been compromised in this manner. this does not impact their ability to work with spren of the uncorrupted oathgates. in the past, the oathgates have been capable of transporting people in and out of shadesmar; however, at some point before their slumbering, the sibling forbade the oathgate spren from performing this service. as such, this function of the oathgate was inaccessible. this being said, the spren corrupted by sja-anat are not bound by this, and can transport people into shadesmar, though it's uncertain if they can bring them back into the physical realm. some oathgate spren have since accepted the authority of the stormfather in this matter, and once again allow travel to shadesmar. this includes some of the spren at urithiru, though others do not accept that the stormfather has the authority to release them from their previous oaths to honor himself. history[edit] creation and the heraldic epochs[edit] the origin of the oathgates is unknown, although they may have been constructed during the silver kingdoms epoch, as they link the capitals of those ancient nations. the oathgate spren chose this transformation willingly. during aharietiam, the city of stormseat was destroyed in unexplained circumstances and its oathgate was forgotten, although the mechanism remained intact. linking far-flung cities with one another and urithiru, the oathgates were administered by members of the knights radiant, whose blades served as the keys that allowed for their operation. much trade and travel was done via the oathgates, with the goods traded tariffed by the radiants. likewise, it seems as though trade with shadesmar was conducted through the oathgates. closing of the oathgates[edit] as time went on, the tariffs imposed by the knights radiant became increasingly steep, which became a source of ire for those taxed. later, just before honor died, the sibling spoke to the spren of the oathgates, ordering them to stop allowing for realmatic transition and only permitting transportation between locations in the physical realm. being bound by honor, the oathgate spren could not rescind this prohibition. as the sibling retreated from mankind and the city of urithiru began to fail, the radiants closed and locked the active oathgates and abandoned the city. in the centuries since, the purpose of the structures was forgotten. some became prime real estate for palaces and markets; others became religious monuments. during the scouring of aimia, the oathgate in akinah was destroyed permanently -- or so it is believed. however, the oathgate was instead hidden away, and a fake oathgate platform constructed above it in an attempt to convince any visitors that the oathgate no longer functioned. the real oathgate is still functional, though still left locked. rediscovery[edit] shortly before the arrival of the true desolation, jasnah kholin began her research into urithiru, and alongside it, the oathgates, hoping they could potentially allow her to find the city. in the course of her research, she successfully identified the locations of most of them, and may have even made an attempt to activate the kholinar oathgate, to no avail. following in jasnah's footsteps, shallan davar successfully located the stormseat oathgate during the battle of narak. she managed to activate it, transferring the alethi forces safely to urithiru. after the battle, this oathgate was used to ferry people from the warcamps on the shattered plains to urithiru. true desolation[edit] with the start of the true desolation, the oathgates became central to dalinar kholin's overall strategy, as they allowed for quick transportation between various corners of the continent. however, many kingdoms were hesitant to allow the warlike alethi direct access into their heartland. king taravangian of jah keved and kharbranth was the first to agree, ordering his radiant, malata, to activate the oathgate. thaylens were the next to agree, and dalinar sent shallan and kaladin to open it from their side. finally, the azish allowed access, after initially denying that the oathgate was even functional. at the same time, one of odium's unmade, sja-anat, suceeded at corrupting the oathgate spren of kholinar to bend them to her master's will. the voidbringers later used this to invade urithiru from kholinar, as a distraction from the attack on thaylen city. after alethi, assisted by teft, managed to push them back, they sent reinforcements to thaylen city through its oathgate to turn the tide of battle. oathgate locations[edit] urithiru[edit] there are ten oathgate platforms on the edges of the grand plaza in front of urithiru. each oathgate is connected to a location in each of the ten ancient silver kingdoms. shattered plains[edit] the natanatan oathgate is located in the city of narak, or stormseat, in the very center of the shattered plains. back when the city was in its prime, the oathgate was located on a round plaza in its south-western part. in the present, the platform forms its own plateau adjacent to narak. this oathgate is the first to have been rediscovered and reactivated in the present day. it's found by shallan during the battle of narak, and used to transport the alethi troops away from the field of battle before they can be killed in the confrontation between the everstorm and a highstorm. later, it becomes urithiru's main connection to the outside world, with goods being brought through it from the plains war camps into the tower-city. alethkar[edit] the alethela oathgate is located in the city of kholinar, the capital of alethkar. it's attached to the kholinar palace by a long covered bridge called the sunwalk, and is technically part of the palatial complex. the oathgate platform serves as the home of the palace ardentia, and is thus covered by numerous buildings. it's called the monastery dais, with the control chamber itself known as the circle of memories. the local ardents believe that the ten lamps in the circle represent the silver kingdoms, while the keyhole represents the need for the priesthood to ignore borders and boundaries. during the siege of kholinar, the platform becomes home to ashertmarn, and as such is the location of the endless revel organized by the cult of moments. at the same time, another unmade, sja-anat, corrupts its spren. when shallan, adolin, kaladin and azure attempt to use the oathgate, they are dumped into shadesmar instead. while the oathgate is later locked from urithiru side after the news of kholinar's fall reaches the tower, malata eventually unlocks it, letting the voidbringers attack urithiru thorugh it. thaylenah[edit] the thalath oathgate is located in the thaylen capital, thaylen city. it sits at the city's highest and east-most point, near the cliffs falling down into the sea. standing high above the other buildings, it provides an excellent view of the entire city. a solitary path connects it to the royal ward. notably, it's the only known oathgate so far not to be located within the original borders of the ancient city it's connected to. in shadesmar, it's connected to land by a long bridge. the oathgate's original purpose remained in the thaylen cultural memory, with stories of a ""portal of worlds"" dazzling children to this day. however, the platform itself has been transformed into a sculpture garden. kaladin and shallan fly to thaylen city to unlock it, while malata does the same from urithiru side, under navani's supervision. from then on out, it's frequently used to transport both people and cargo. it's particularly crucial in the battle of thaylen field, as kaladin and his group fight there in an attempt to return from shadesmar, and the gate itself is used to transport reinforcements to help repel the fused. azir[edit] the makabakam oathgate is located in the city of azimir in azir. in the present day, it has been covered up by a bronze dome, with the interior serving as an indoor shopping district, known as the grand market. the control building itself is treated as a religious monument of some kind. once the azish learn that the structure is an oathgate, they close down the grand market and build an extensive wooden structure within, indended to funnel anyone coming out of the control chamber down a single, highly defensible path. although they initially refuse to open the gate out of fear of the blackthorn, they eventually allow lift to do so to let dalinar visit their city. dalinar intends to inform them that the entire platform can be swapped, rendering their defences meaningless, although it's unknown whether he ended up passing that information along. jah keved[edit] the valhav oathgate is located in the city of vedenar, the capital of jah keved. it stands on one of the highest of the grand terraces of the city. alongside a ramp, a set of stairs leads up to the platform. like the other terraces in vedenar, the oathgate platform has been turned into a grand garden in the centuries since it's been locked. after taravangian decides to ally with dalinar, malata unlocks the oathgate. the garden is then cleaned up, clearing the platform for full use. akinah[edit] the aimia oathgate is located in the city of akinah. it was believed to have been destroyed during the scouring of aimia. in actuality, it survived the scouring, and fell under the protection of the sleepless, who had vowed to protect the dawnshard which also resided on the island. in an attempt to conceal it, a building was built on top of the oathgate platform and crem was allowed to cover it. a fake oathgate

mission of determining the location and state of the akinah oathgate. on arriving in akinah, lopen and rushu found the fake oathgate building exactly where they expected it. however, due to a number

the actual oathgate platform. after rysn brokered a peace agreement with the sleepless, the wandersail was allowed to leave akinah with knowledge of the oathgate. the oathgate was not opened, however,

New Natanan,https://coppermind.net/wiki/New_Natanan,"""“ [au-nak] represented a dead kingdom that had been reduced to a single city-state on the eastern coast of roshar with a few other cities as protectorates. ”- navani on au-nak and new natanan"" new natanan is a city-state on roshar whose power extends to a few surrounding settlements. the people of natanan are called the natan. location and geography[edit] new natanan is the easternmost city of the rosharan continent. in lies on the shores of the ocean of origins, on a large peninsula jutting out of the frostlands, a sparsely-populated and mostly lawless region in the south-east. new natanan's position makes it the first settlement to be hit by an arriving highstorm as it comes on land. the news of a stormwall are sent out to other kingdoms from there via spanreeds. there have been several attempts in the past to find a river passage between alethkar and new natanan, one of which resulted in the discovery of the parshendi by alethi explorers. however, so far it appears that the only way to access the country is either by a land caravan or by sea. history[edit] the region new natanan now lies in was once part of the silver kingdom of natanatan, with its capital in stormseat. following the catastrophe that created the shattered plains, the country slowly fell apart, until it was reduced to a single settlement -- new natanan. by the war of reckoning, new natanan had become a valuable trade hub as the biggest city on the eastern coast. prior to the war, dalinar had taken a small force through it to claim the shattered plains for the kholins. within a few years, the natan had an ambassador, au-nak, in the alethi warcamps. jasnah and shallan's ship was sunk on its way to the city, as it was from there that caravans travelled to the plains. when the everstorm first appeared, new natanan was the first major city to be struck by it, although dalinar and navani tried to warn its people of the new storm. though its uncertain whether they believed the message, the natan confirmed the existence of the everstorm to the thaylen after it had passed over them. though dalinar invited new natanan into his coalition, they were initially coy, playing for time. however, they agreed to join after king taravangian brought jah keved and kharbranth into the alliance. from then, the natan ambassador to the alethi became the city-state's representative in urithiru. culture[edit] people[edit] the natan people have pale blue skin and wooly white hair. a local myth claims that this is the result of an ancient natan queen, tsa, having children with the blue moon, nomon. in reality, their odd skin tone comes from the natan being part-humans and part-siah aimians. this mixed ancestry gives them a some other benefits, although what they are is uncertain. some natan dye their hair, though only a few locks of it, in vivid colours, such as dark red, possibly to denote some kind of rank or social status. their names have several forms, including the common one and a high one - for example, a high form of the name au-nak is nak-ali. vorinism[edit] the natan are largely vorin, although their particular variety of vorinism differs from what is practiced elsewhere. in addition to worshipping the almighty and the heralds, the natan appear to revere the moons, with nomon as the most important. some alethi ardents consider the natan to be almost pagan, and sometimes question how devout they really are when out of the sight of ""proper"" vorins. nonetheless, new natanan is considered one of the important vorin states by the high-ranking church officials, and their religious leaders are included in any discussion regarding the doctrine. apart from the religion, the natan follow at least some vorin customs. the leaders of new natanan have occasionally claimed the first dahn, the highest rank a vorin lighteyes can hold. their language belongs to the vorin family, same as the alethi and veden, although it is noted as dying out, implying many, if not most natan don't actually speak it. politics[edit] despite being one of roshar's smallest nations, new natanan holds great political importance in the region. it's the largest city on the shores of the ocean of origins. as such, any ships sailing through it stop there to rest and resupply, and there's always trade happening. new natanan is also important for predicting the highstorms, as it supplies the other states with information on any new one making landfall. additionally, the city provides the easiest way to reach the shattered plains, with numerous caravans traveling between it and the alethi warcamps. new natanan's importance extends even to the matters military -- any force holding the city would find it an excellent staging ground for an invasion of the plains. the natan are well-aware of all this, and have sent an ambassador to the warcamps on the plains to curry favour with the alethi lighteyes. the natan claim to be the inheritors of the ancient natanatan, and believe that they should be in charge of the oathgate in stormseat, natanatan's ancient capital. however, they do not possess enough political or military power to enforce this claim. notable citizens[edit] -

""he offered, holy lord.""”-kelek and sekeir, about adolin"" sekeir, as leader of the honorspren fortress and capital lasting integrity, greeted kelek when he arrived at the fortress after the arrival of the ambassadorial group from the coalition of monarchs. as they walked through the fortress, they came by adolin; sekeir explained that adolin was there because he had offered to stand trial for the recreance. when adolin asked to have a trial by witness, sekeir was on the point of advising against it when kelek cut him off and accepted. on the first day of the trial, sekeir planned a long speech at the outset to lay out the point of the trial. he was offended that kelek told him to keep it short, then argued with adolin over the exact terms of their agreement. sekeir managed to convince kelek that the trial was to prove generally that humans could not be trusted, although adolin did manage to persuade the herald to consider his personal character as well. when kelek finally understood the terms correctly, sekeir called his first witness: amuna, keeper of the deadeyes. after amuna gave witness, sekeir called up blended next and then notum. the morning of the final judgement, sekeir, lusintia, and several other honorspren discovered shallan in kelek's house. they accused the two of collusion, and sekeir ordered that kelek be sequestered due to a ""bout of weakness."" at the trial that day, sekeir took kelek's place in the judge's seat and ordered the trial to continue. when adolin asked where the herald was, sekeir explained that kelek sometimes suffered from his multitude of years and experiences as a herald and admitted that shallan had tried to influence the man; he was displeased that adolin thought that was something to smile about. after sekeir called for silence to begin the trial, he felt he had to show his authority by throwing out a few spren who continued to whisper to each other. sekeir then began the day's proceedings by delivering a lengthy speech denouncing adolin. when adolin interrupted him at one point, he threatened adolin with a gag and instructed him that he was only allowed to speak while they questioned the witness. when sekeir finally finished, he called for them to lead maya in as the final witness and allowed the crowd to converse as much as they wanted. sekeir, pleased with himself for his convenient choice of a witness, declared his right to guide the conversation due to maya's inability to speak for herself and proceeded to question adolin. he forced adolin into admitting that humans continued to use shardblades even after realizing that they were dead spren, but he refused to allow maya to retreat after adolin's concession. instead, sekeir planned to use maya to exact personal revenge on adolin for the divisions among the honorspren that his presence had brought to the surface. ""“you. cannot. have. my. sacrifice!”-maya to sekeir"" sekeir made a spectacle of maya, commanding everyone to look at her and consider what had been done to her; he asserted that he had to speak for maya because of humans like adolin and claimed to know maya's mind, despite adolin's protests. he continued to shout over the din of the crowd, adolin's pleas, and maya's groans, condemning humans generally and adolin in particular up until maya spoke. shocked but still convinced he was right, sekeir accused adolin of doing something to cause maya to rave. maya, fed up with him, screamed inarticulately and then transitioned to words, denying him the right to take from her her sacrifice. sekeir was struck dumb by the revelation of the deadeyes' choice, staring at her silently as the other elders gathered around and the crowd began to leave. after the trial, sekeir and the other honorspren leaders were held in disgrace and their isolationist policy was overturned. notes[edit]"
Ala,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ala,"""“i'm … supposed to stay. i'm not supposed to talk. to you. to anyone. ”-ala to shallan"" ala is a seon on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] like all seons, ala appears as a glowing ball of light, with its namesake aon at the center. it seems traumatized by the ghostbloods and acts like an abused child, reluctant to come out of its cube or speak to anyone. history[edit] ala was kept in a metal cube by mraize, and was given to shallan for use as a communication device between realms before her expedition to lasting integrity. after speaking with hoid, shallan, with help from kalak, was eventually able to free ala from the cube without harming it. notes[edit]"
Prime Aqasix,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Prime_Aqasix,"the prime aqasix is the title of the elected ruler of azir. titles[edit] the full title of the current prime aqasix is as follows: ""“ his imperial majesty ch.v.d. yanagawn the first, emperor of makabak, king of azir, lord of the bronze palace, prime aqasix, grand minister and emissary of yaezir ”- from a message sent to urithiru"" election process[edit] to be elected prime aqasix, prospective candidates are each allowed to submit paperwork to convince the vizierate as a whole that they are worthy of the position. only the scions (the priests) are not able to apply, as they are traditionally visiting and blessing the settlements of the nation. the selection process is symbolically done in the presence of the new prime, as the azish believe they are never without one. therefore, the election is, in truth, a way of finding out who the current prime is. the essays of all candidates are judged together by a large assembly of viziers and scions. after everyone reads through all the essays, a debate ensues where the electors propose their candidates and discuss their merits, with the scions providing a theological and religious perspective on the matter. the viziers who applied are permitted to be present, and are free to argue for themselves. at the end of the discussion, a vote occurs, with the winner being proclaimed the new prime. on special occasions, a person can be said to have applied not through their essay, but rather through their actions, or through an omen from the kadasixes. one such occasion occurred when yanagawn was elected - while he was illiterate, and robbing the palace at the time, his miraculous return from the dead was judged by the scions to be a sign that he would be the perfect ruler for the troubling times, as several of his predecessors had been assassinated. ""“ praise to yaezir, kadasix of kings, may he lead in wisdom. this youth is prime. he has been prime always. we have only now realized it, and beg his forgiveness for not seeing the truth sooner. ”- formal appointment of a new prime aqasix"" rights and duties[edit] the symbol of office for a prime aqasix is a hat with sweeping sides called the imperial yuanazixin. the prime is the leader of the azish empire, and as such is responsible for their international politics, diplomatic relations and other matters of state. however, they are not an absolute ruler, and are obliged to listen to their advisors, most importantly the viziers. together, the viziers have sufficient pull to force their own opinion on the prime. in addition, whenever a prime makes a public decree, all citizens have a month to comply, and may protest the new law in the meantime through both formal and informal means. the prime is considered a public asset, owned by the people. as such, there are lotteries for the chance to watch the prime sleep or eat, and the onlookers are free to collect items such as hair or nail clippings. in fact, a prime appears to be a quasi-religious figure for the azish, as pieces of ancient primes are sometimes preserved as relics. the prime's permission is required for the leaders of the azish empire's member states to marry. history[edit] the office of the prime aqasix is an old one, dating at least as far back as the sunmaker, which coincided with the reign of prime snoxil. in the modern day, the position of the prime was a fairly stable one until szeth assassinated two primes in a row, leading to a succession crisis. this was ultimately resolved with the ascension of gawx, who was healed by lift after being nearly killed by one of nale's accomplices. the viziers pronounced gawx's healing to be a miracle pointing to him as the current prime, as such a gift would allow him to survive an assassination. upon being made the prime, gawx was renamed to yanagawn. known primes[edit] - - the prime who reigned during - conquests. his finger has been preserved as a holy relic, and is sometimes brought out as an argument during debates. - - a prime from an unspecified period of azir's past, whose writings - uses in her essay while negotiating with the azish. - the first - the current prime, former thief who was pronounced the prime while attempting to rob the palace. notes[edit]"
Azimir,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Azimir,"azimir is the capital city of azir, and the seat of the prime aqasix, the leader of the azish empire. geography[edit] azimir is located in the southern part of the country, near the border with tashikk and emul. its location is well-protected from highstorms. it is one of the larger cities on roshar, with population exceeding that of kholinar, and far greater population density. history[edit] azimir is one of the oldest cities on the planet. that it has its own oathgate implies that it might've been the capital of makabakam, the silver kingdom within whose lands it would've laid during the heraldic epochs. in 1173, the city saw a string of assassinations as szeth, under orders from taravangian, assassinated prime aqasix after prime aqasix as they were being elected, leading to a succession crisis as prospective candidates grew too fearful to apply. at the same time, the city was visited by the herald nale, who was hunting lift for her surgebinding. the meeting between them in the bronze palace led to lift revealing her abilities and gawx being elected the new prime after she healed him. following the everstorm, the former parshmen left the city, and attempted to sue the government for their back pay. while the negotiations took place, the azish intended to destroy the city's oathgate. however, those plans were abandoned after dalinar kholin convinced the azish government to join his alliance and the oathgate was unlocked by lift for easy access to urithiru, while the negotiations with the singers broke down with the arrival of the fused. landmarks[edit] the bronze palace is the seat of the azish government, and the home of the prime aqasix. its name comes from it being mostly made out of bronze through soulcasting. this includes not only its walls and spires, but also trees and decorations. the city's indoor shopping district, an enormous building covered by a bronze dome. it is located on top of the city's oathgate platform. upon learning of this fact, the azish emptied it out and transformed it into a fort to protect against possible alethi invastion, thinking that only the contents of the control chamber could be teleported. notes[edit]"
Triax,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Triax,"triax is a small nation in southern roshar. geography and ecology[edit] the country lies in the southern part of central roshar, between an unnamed mountain range and the tarat sea. it borders tu fallia to the west and jah keved to the east. a single river splits the country in two. there are no settlements of global importance there. however, its position at the edge of western and eastern roshar lends it great strategic importance. for anybody seeking to cross the country to invade its neighbors, the northern mountains and the southern coast form a bottleneck that makes moving troops through it highly difficult. the stormfather shows dalinar kholin the area around triax and tu fallia in a vision. dalinar has little experience with triax, and describes lush valleys with flora and fauna that look alien to him. it has an area around 336,000 km2. in comparison to real-world nations, it is a little smaller than the total area of finland. history[edit] during the silver kingdoms era, the region was split in half between makabakam and valhav. at some point during the era of solitude, the area that would later become triax was invaded by the veden king nanhar, although he died during the war and was succeeded by his brother, nankhet. as nankhet died only three months later, giving way to a new dynasty, it's likely the veden conquest never succeeded. vstim has purchased wormy grain in triax at a large discount knowing that he could sell it for a profit in other lands. during the true desolation, the voidbringers struck at the strip of land bordering the tarat sea, including marat and triax. contact with the country, including its spanreeds, was lost mere weeks after the arrival of the everstorm, implying that it was one of the first states that fell to the enemy. following the battle of thaylen field, triax remained under control of odium's forces. dalinar and his coalition desired to recapture the area in order to reinforce their naval superiority in the south of the continent. notes[edit]"
Yezier,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Yezier,"yezier is a princedom in southwestern roshar and one of the member states of the azish empire. it's ruled by a princess. geography[edit] yezier lays in the western part of the geographical region known as makabak, in the south-west of roshar. it's bordered by desh to the north, azir to the east, and tashikk and liafor to the south. its western border sits on an unnamed river, which it shares with alm, while in north-east, it reaches the misted mountains separating it from shinovar. it claims about 396 thousand square kilometers of land, making it the fifth largest state in the azish empire, and the seventeenth largest country on roshar as a whole. like most makabaki states, yezier appears to be rather dry and sparsely-populated. other than its border with alm, there are no major rivers there, and no settlements worth noting. history[edit] during the silver kingdoms era, yezier was part of makabakam. it's unknown when they split off. eventually, they joined a makabaki coalition under the leadership of the prime aqasix, becoming a client state to the azish empire. following the everstorm, dalinar kholin sought to persuade them to join his coalition, hoping that they would help convince other states in the region. while he managed to speak with their princess, she demured, awaiting the decision of the prime aqasix. after the azish agreed to join, yezier followed suit, with the princess herself coming to urithiru. shortly before the battle of thaylen field, the azish withdrew from the coalition; however, yezier remained, and the princess sought to tie herself and her country closer to alethkar. this might've been partially motivated by iri defecting to odium, as yezier was worried about being invaded by them. politics and culture[edit] yezier is a member of the azish empire, and as such subject to the rule of the prime aqasix. however, the country has rulers of its own - currently, an unnamed princess. recently, she began courting halam khal, one of house kholin highlords, although she cannot marry him without the prime's permission. yezier is traditionally very close to azish throne, and the princess is noted to live in azimir for half of every year. the country has no oathgates. it's unknown whether they possess any shards, though ordinarily they, like any other member state, can borrow the imperial shardblades of azir. whether that still holds true during the true desolation is unknown. they are known for their stormwardens and timekeepers. along with the neighboring country of liafor, they are one of the centres of fashion on roshar, and have been for decades. their likely speak one or more of the makabaki languages. their name might be derived from yaezir, the name used for jezrien across makabak. notable citizens[edit] - the princess - the ruler of yezier. comes to - personally to plead for help against a possible - invasion. - a - - one of - trainees in - is from yezier, and complains about the tashikki coyness. trivia[edit] - yezier's size is comparable to that of earth countries of - and - . notes[edit]"
Tu Fallia,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tu_Fallia,"tu fallia is a small nation in southern roshar. geography and ecology[edit] it borders greater hexi, triax, emul, and tu bayla. it is on the edge of the tarat sea. the stormfather shows dalinar kholin the area around tu fallia and triax in a vision. dalinar has little experience with tu fallia, and describes lush valleys with flora and fauna that look alien to him. it has an area of around 127,000km2, making it the smallest known nation on roshar. in comparison to real-world nations, it is somewhat larger than eritrea. history[edit] during the silver kingdoms era, tu fallia was a part of makabakam. urithiru has an underground system of caverns, and there is a stream that leads to an exit in the mountain foothills of tu fallia after several days' march. re-shephir was suspected to have fled through this exit after her confrontation with shallan davar. politics[edit] szeth considers tu fallia a nomadic backwater similar to hexi. it is only nominally a ""nation"" and it lacks any form of organized government, even compared to the loose tribal coalition of marat. notes[edit]"
Steen,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Steen,"steen is a kingdom at the tip of a peninsula in southwestern roshar. as such, it only borders liafor. geography[edit] steen has an area of around 156,000 km2, making it one of the smallest rosharan nations, larger than only alm, bavland, and tu fallia.. in comparison to real world nations, area is very close to the land area of suriname. it is situated on the southwestern coast of roshar, and is surrounded on three sides by the aimian sea and the southern depths. it shares a border only with liafor. politics[edit] steen is probably ruled by a group of merchants known as the ‘merchant lords’. culture[edit] the people from steen wear their beards wrapped in cords - a fashion that has been shown elsewhere in roshar and the cosmere. later, nikli comments that 'ordinary people' in aimia (i.e. not the sleepless) wore their beards in the peculiar cord-like style of steen. steen probably has good mercenaries as the crew of first dreams on its trip to akinah is made up of steen mercenaries. noura describes them as a tricky bunch. history[edit] during the silver kingdoms era, it was part of makabakam. after makabakam collapsed steen became independent. noura hints that they shouldn't be invited to the urithiru talks along with the other makabak representatives. just before the battle of thaylen field, a report from steen relayed to a meeting in urithiru confirms that the early everstorm reported by shinovar has passed and also mentions that it is faster and more violent than previous storms. this comes just before the other revelations about the eila stele and the first voidbringers. prior to the voyage of the wandersail to aimia, lopen indicates that men from steen were present in urithiru. beard tells a tale about him swimming across a vat of dyes when in service to the steen merchant lords. notes[edit]"
Marat,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Marat,"""“szeth knew that marat was rich in culture, full of people as proud as you’d find in any nation-but of almost no value on the political scale. ”-szeth thinking about marat"" marat is a small kingdom in southern roshar. it is part of the makabaki region. geography and ecology[edit] marat borders the southern depths to the south, tukar to the west, emul to the northwest, and greater hexi to the east. the northernmost part of marat includes the southernmost part of mountain range in the center of the continent. a river separates the border between marat and tukar. a grain similar to wheat that pulls down into burrows grows in marat. disc-like creatures with claws eat the grain then leave droppings with seeds to the east. the seeds grow into polyps, then blow back west to grow into grain. despite its low population, marat has a few notable settlements. along the southern depths is the city of rossen dar--possibly marat's capital--and the towns of jabom and ja dran. near tukar's border, there is the town of khrishji, and close to hexi there is the town of mikhan. it has an area of around 524,000km2. in terms of real-world nations, it is larger than the total area of thailand. history[edit] szeth visited the country during his exile. during the true desolation, one of the first moves of the fused was to gather a large force of singers in southern marat. during their conquest, the singers pressed any survivors into labor at docks but allowed them to burn their dead. the fused amassed a large naval fleet of over a hundred ships in the marat ports and coves in preparation to launch an attack at thaylen city. in the week before the assault, venli lived in a cave and told the story of the listeners to the singers to prepare them to fight. nale brought szeth and the other skybreakers there to tell them the truth of the first desolation. the fleet left for thaylen city during the surprise everstorm and returned after odium's defeat. politics[edit] marat is a tribal nation. each city in the country is run by a leader referred to as elder brother, analogous to the highprinces of eastern nations. marat's only contribution in global politics is its role as a waystop between vorin and makabaki kingdoms. marat has a low population. some people in the east, including taravangian, consider the marati people to be barbarians. culture[edit] peoples[edit] west of marat, women's hands are not covered for modesty. the people who live in marat, as in tukar and the reshi isles, tend to have brown skin tones and black hair. their clothes have colours similar to azish patterns. the cloth is thicker and coarser then azish clothing. their outfits are also more enveloping then azish clothing and have braided tassels that hang low from the waist. this style is common in the south east of makabak. economy[edit] marat has grand bazaars that attract merchants looking for lucrative trade. some of marat's exports are fine furniture and rugs. highprince dalinar kholin used some to decorate his barracks. queen fen gave shallan a fine marati rug as a wedding gift. mraize owns rugs from marat. settlements[edit] notes[edit]"
Greater Hexi,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Greater_Hexi,"greater hexi is a small nation in southern roshar during the era of solitude. geography[edit] greater hexi lies in the south-central part of the rosharan continent, between the tarat sea and the mountains where urithiru is located. it shares borders with marat and tu fallia to its south-west and north-east respectively, though there are no apparent geographical features that dictate those borders. the island on the tarat sea that lies just off the coast can be assumed to also belong to greater hexi. the country has few geographical features, being composed mostly of desolate, windswept flatlands. they are largely devoid of rockbuds, but rather covered in small gashes, about one to three inches deep, giving it an appearance of wrinkles or ripples. those ""wrinkles"" are covered with lichen on the stormward side, and flattened grass on the opposite one. trees are sparse and scrawny, bending leeward so far as to nearly touch the ground. the mountaintops are similarly bare, scoured raw by the highstorms. the only known settlement in greater hexi is lexili, near the border of marat. another notable location is the valley of the nightwatcher, in the mountains that form the country's north-western border. it has an area around 454,000 km2. in terms of real-world nations, this puts it slightly larger than the total area of sweden. politics and culture[edit] the people of hexi are largely nomadic; one can travel there for many days without encountering a village. like other states in the region, it's considered a backwater, even when compared with nearby marat. the people wear their hair in braids and tend to be quiet and uninterested in international affairs. they can be challenging trading partners as their language is difficult to learn; respectful language may be rewarded with gifts while the arrogant are rejected altogether. after a trading visit by rysn the hexi left ""singing their farewell,"" which may indicate that songs are an important feature of their culture or religion. the hexi religion involves the keeping of sacred animals, and priests take oaths not to eat flesh. grubs and insects are excluded, however, as they are considered plants. as a result, fresh grain with worms is a highly prized food source. the hexi also make jerky from dead animals, but it is specifically intended for trading with outsiders. at this time, it is unknown if there is a ""lesser hexi"", or some equivalent. however, the state is usually referred to as simply ""hexi"", making the existence of other hexis unlikely. history[edit] in the year 1168, dalinar takes a small contingent of soldiers into hexi when he visits the nightwatcher. they travel with a caravan until they're close to the valley. notes[edit]"
Desh,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Desh,"desh is a kingdom in southwestern roshar during the era of solitude and a member state of the azish empire. geography[edit] desh is a small nation that is situated at the foot of a mountainous area in western roshar. it borders azir to the east and yezier to the south. shinovar lies to the west and babatharnam to the north, but they are separated by the mountains. during the silver kingdoms era, desh was a part of makabakam. politics and culture[edit] as a member of the azish empire, desh formally recognizes the prime aqasix as its emperor. in practice, the member states of the empire are generally self-governing, although they follow azir's lead in international matters and maintain deference to the emperor through certain cultural customs. people from desh were common visitors to the tashikki city of yeddaw. lift characterizes their clothing as ""rural"" in appearance with lighter colors, similar to clothing worn in alm. many of desh's inhabitants are nomads, who travel between various waystops. such waystops are typically marked by stone obelisks. history[edit] lift visited desh in her past and enjoyed it, as few people had tried to kill her during her time there. one of desh's ambassadors was in azimir when noura told dalinar that the makabak empire would join his coalition against odium. notes[edit]"
Alm,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Alm,"alm is a kingdom in southwestern roshar that is a member nation of the azish empire. geography[edit] alm is a small nation bordered by yezier and liafor. it is also adjacent to shinovar, although the two nations are separated by the misted mountains. most of alm's territory lies between a large river and the mountains. it also has a small coastline on a bay connected to the aimian sea. culture[edit] as a member of the azish empire, alm is self-governing, but recognizes the prime aqasix as their emperor and generally follows azir's lead in international politics. since alm's population is ethnically makabaki, its people generally have dark skin and hair, and the local language is presumably a variant of azish. alm and the nearby nation of desh are considered to be more rural than other azish nations, and local fashion consists of clothing that is lighter than that of their neighbors. history[edit] during the silver kingdoms era, alm was part of makabakam. during the era of solitude, it joined other makabaki nations to form the azish empire. at some point after the recreance and the subsequent scouring of aimia, alm experienced an influx of refugees from aimia, although it is not certain when exactly this occurred and at what rate. it is also unclear how many refugees immigrated to alm and what impact this might have had on the local culture and population. lift once visited alm and enjoyed her time there, since relatively few people tried to kill her. due to their location on the western edge of roshar, steen and alm were the first nations to report the arrival of the everstorm, which worried ghenna and the government of tashikk. both alm and desh had ambassadors in azimir when yanagawn agreed to visit urithiru. notes[edit]"
Southern Depths,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Southern_Depths,"the southern depths is the ocean to the south of roshar. it lies off the coast of tukar, marat, and thaylenah. it is presumably quite deep. it also likely extends to the south pole of the planet. control of thaylenah's waters dictates control of the entirety of the southern depth, however, true dominance of the region requires control of emul and tukar as well. in 1173, shallan davar and jasnah kholin traveled through the southern depths on the wind's pleasure on their way to the shattered plains. the strategic importance of thaylenah led to the voidbringer forces attacking thaylen city near the beginning of the true desolation. a thaylen merchant ship tried to scout for voidbringers in the southern depths near marat and spotted a large number of ships at dock along the coast. the ship relayed the information via spanreed. then, figures with glowing eyes--the fused--rose from a nearby city, attacking the ship, and the ship was never heard from again. shortly thereafter, the voidbringer forces launched from marat to thaylen city, using the everstorm to propel them quickly across the southern depths, triggering the battle of thaylen fields. the urithiru coalition gained control of the southern depths several months after the battle at thaylen field, after the thaylen navy won the area and forced the enemy ships to retreat to the coast of iri. notes[edit]"
Makabakam,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Makabakam,"makabakam was the largest of the historic silver kingdoms of roshar. geography[edit] makabakam took up most of the south-western part of the rosharan continent. it shared most of its long northern border with sela tales, while in the west, it bordered shin kak nish (modern shinovar) on the misted mountains and to the east, it had a short border with valhav. to the south, the country lay on the coast of the aimian sea and southern depths, and controlled a number of islands dividing those two. the city of urithiru, the home of the knights radiant, was located within makabakam borders, but it is unlikely it was actually subject to makabaki rule. the ancient capital of makabakam was likely the city currently known as azimir, as it is there that the state's oathgate is located. in the modern era, makabakam has split into a number of countries, including alm, azir, desh, emul, greater hexi, liafor, marat, steen, tashikk, tu fallia, tukar, yezier, and triax (although triax lays partly on lands that used to belong to valhav). culture[edit] the people of makabakam ancestry are called the makabaki. they can be recognized by having far darker skin than most rosharans, although they still have epicanthic folds. there are approximately thirty makabaki languages, with azish being the most commonly spoken. the makabaki worship the heralds not the almighty. in the present day, the region once occupied by makabakam is called makabak. notes[edit]"
Inkspren,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Inkspren,"""“ you think by facts. you change not on simple whims. you are as you are. ”- ivory"" inkspren are a race of sapient spren that dwell primarily in the cognitive realm of roshar. they tend to be attracted to those who are logical and willing to think through their decisions, as opposed to acting on instinct. they can form nahel bonds, giving people the powers of the order of elsecallers. appearance[edit] physical realm[edit] in the physical realm, inkspren look exactly like their cognitive form, but are able to change their size. cognitive realm[edit] in the cognitive realm, inkspren are humanoid, and their form does not change. they have angular features, more reminiscent of an unfinished statue than a real person. they are entirely black, as if made of shadows, and have marble-like skin with a prismatic quality as though it has been coated in a thin layer of oil. their skin shimmers and gleams in a variety of colors depending on how the light hits it. they wear stiff, fashionable clothing that matches their shade and texture; the clothing is part of their essence. they sometimes carry weapons like swords, which may or may not be sheathed, and sometimes hang in the air besides them. they have armor as part of their form, similar to carapace. abilities[edit] unlike other sapient spren, inkspren cannot shape-shift or make themselves invisible to humans while in the physical realm; they are, however, capable of drastically changing their size. they can become as large as a person and as small as a speck of dust, letting them move about unseen if they so wish. they are also capable of blending into shadows. nahel bond[edit] inkspren are one of the spren types capable of forming nahel bonds with humans. the bond makes a person a surgebinder, and grants the powers of transformation and transportation. culture[edit] ""“ you think all humans are unstable. ”- jasnah to ivory"" inkspren have a particular way of speaking, using ""be"" instead of phrases like ""be here"" or ""exist"" -- for example, ""a spren is"" rather than ""there's a spren here"", or ""a traitor is"" instead of ""a traitor exists"". they prefer simple, limited body language. they dislike humans for their irrational and changing nature, and admire those among them who are willing to be cautious, logical and unemotional. their society as a whole is hostile to the idea of reforming the knights radiant, believing that death is the only option for a bonded spren. it's implied they'd be willing to kill a bonded human to ""rescue"" their kinsmen from such a fate, even if the inkspren entered the bond willingly. there are very few of them interested in attempting the nahel bond again, with ivory seemingly the only one to dare to do so. it seems he is not entirely alone in his views, however, as several other inkspren accompany him to watch the beginnings of his bond with jasnah. it's uncertain if inkspren have their own nation in shadesmar, although they are very common in cities like celebrant. notable inkspren[edit] - (bonded to - ) notes[edit]"
Cremling,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Cremling,"a cremling is a type of scavenger crustacean that can be found almost everywhere on roshar. rather than a single species, the term - derived from crem, a type of sediment - encompasses a wide variety of creatures. cremlings that live in the ocean are sometimes called sealings. appearance and anatomy[edit] as there are many species of cremlings, their appearance is not uniform. they tend to be tiny, multilegged, and thin, with elongated bodies and purple blood. most have claws and a carapace. one known variety is skrip, which has a flat tail, two large claws and long antennae. cremlings come in variety of colors. ones living in the chasms of the shattered plains have a reddish hue with semi-transparent carapace, making their organs visible. in kharbranth, there are cremlings shaded like the feelers of shalebark, while in the purelake, they have a multitude of colors. some species, including a variety called ""sigs cremlings"" by the listeners, are poisonous, and indicate so by having vividly red claws or bright coloring on their backs. cremlings can make sounds, including screeching and clicking. songling - a small crustacean capable of far wider vocal range - might be a type of cremling. ecology[edit] cremlings grow from larvae, which mature in stagnant pools of water. adults live in burrows often located in cracks in the rock. some creatures that rosharans call cremlings are actually larvae forms of larger animals, like chulls or maybe even tai-na. cremlings have two primary food sources: scavenging and plant matter. typically, they drink blood and eat the flesh of the deceased humans, parshendi, and other creatures, such as chasmfiends. in the period immediately after highstorms, they expand their diet to plants, as those will often unfurl to drink in the nutrient-rich rainwater, allowing the cremlings to feed on the newly-exposed parts. in addition, some cremlings seem to have a symbiotic relationship with shalebark. they clean the shalebark by eating anything that has built up on it, and take on coloring that helps them blend with it, disguising them from predators. cremlings are in turn preyed upon by graspers, who will swiftly seize them and pull them into their lairs. for an unknown reason, some cremlings molt occasionally, shedding their carapace. some cremlings are capable of seeing investiture. culture[edit] cremlings are generally reviled on roshar, being treated as little more than annoying and disgusting pests. calling someone a cremling is one of roshar's most common insults, with meaning similar to ""rat"" or ""snake"". in idioms, cremlings are usually synonymous with cautious or cowardly behaviour. cremlings are edible for humans. while not considered high-quality, their overabundance makes them a reliable food source, and a good cook can turn them into a fine dish. they are usually boiled, and the water left afterwards can be drank, although the latter seems to be a habit limited to the horneaters. they taste similarly to crabs. some people collect various species of cremlings, pinning them to boards like butterflies. as with ""chicken"" and ""spren"", the term ""cremling"" is often misapplied by rosharans to refer to creatures that aren't part of the same group, like some non-crustacean hordelings, insects and greatshell larvae. sleepless[edit] some cremlings are part of sleepless swarms, and share a common hive mind. such cremlings, called hordelings, are typically heavily-specialized, with some trained to act as ears or eyes, or to assume humanoid coloring so as to allow the sleepless to pretend to be human. they can operate at a significant distance from the rest of their swarm, making them perfect spies. through heavy breeding, over multiple generations, they can be evolved to do almost anything, including mimicking larkin abilities. in the past, hordelings have directly participated in the desolations, fighting on the side of the knights radiant. dalinar witnesses a burnt pile of them in one of his dream-visions. notes[edit]"
Dreaming-though-Awake,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Dreaming-though-Awake,"""“do you think me pretty, or do you think me a monster? ”-dreaming-though-awake"" dreaming-though-awake is a mistspren on roshar bonded to arshqqam. appearance and personality[edit] as a mistspren, dreaming-though-awake manifests in the physical realm as a shimmer of light on the wall reflected from a mirror. in shadesmar, she chooses to manifest as a female made entirely of mist. her face appears as a porcelain mask that always reflects a twinkling light and almost seems to be crystal from some perspectives; the lips remain stationary when she speaks. she wears a vest, trousers, and gloves that interact with her body as if it were physical, even though it seems to be made of white smoke. when she walks, she seems to drift rather than to step. dreaming-though-awake has a personality that is somewhat off-putting to humans. she is fascinated by humans and even finds what questions they ask and what they think about to be revealing. attributes and abilities[edit] dreaming-though-awake can speak multiple rosharan languages and serves as a translator between arshqqam and the alethi. it is unclear if this is because she has learned the languages or if this is simply an aspect of her nature. by the nature of their bond, dreaming-though-awake and arshqqam can use stormlight to access the surges of the order of truthwatchers, illumination and progression. history[edit] forming a bond[edit] dreaming-though-awake was born some time after the recreance. around 1174, she sought out arshqqam in yeddaw and bonded her. using the powers of their bond, arshqqam began healing the orphans who came to her orphanage. when jasnah began investigating renarin, whose claim to be a truthwatcher was suspect to her because of the appearance of his spren, arshqqam was convinced to visit azimir so that some of jasnah's colleagues could make a drawing of dreaming-though-awake. the disparity convinced jasnah that glys was something different. joining the radiants[edit] arshqqam eventually felt impelled to leave tashikk and join the rest of the knights radiant at urithiru; once there, she and dreaming-though-awake were chosen to join the coalition's diplomatic expedition to the honorspren. they transitioned to shadesmar using urithiru's oathgate control building, and dreaming-though-awake immediately began studying the humans. she asked adolin for his opinion of her appearance, then interrogated him while he led maya around introducing the rest of the party to her. when adolin spoke with arshqqam a little while later, dreaming-though-awake translated for her while arshqqam spoke about lift and her decision to leave yeddaw. ""“i find the questions fascinating. what you wonder tells me so much.”-dreaming-though-awake"" on the second day of their journey, shallan sat on the barge sketching when she decided to try to capture dreaming-though-awake's odd appearance. the spren approached her and was disappointed to find just a sketch of herself, hoping to see a drawing of the unmade. when shallan eagerly plied dreaming-though-awake with questions regarding ba-ado-mishram, the mistspren had no answers her. dreaming-though-awake read the letters that jasnah and dalinar sent with the group to appeal to the honorspren and discussed them with arshqqam; later, she translated as arshqqam pointed out the flaws in their arguments. citing dreaming-though-awake's observation that honorspren can be passionate, arshqqam suggested that adolin appeal to their sense of honor. when adolin realized that the caravan of humans behind them had been waiting for a chance to attack notum, adolin raced off to save him, leaving the rest of the group to follow as quickly as they could. the rest of the group outpaced arshqqam, dreaming-though-awake, and the cryptics, who only made it about halfway before meeting the rest of the party returning with notum and adolin. after adolin, shallan, maya, and pattern entered lasting integrity, arshqqam and dreaming-though-awake left with zu, ua'pam, and adolin's soldiers to bring word of the situation to dalinar. notes[edit]"
Order of Truthwatchers,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Truthwatcher,"the order of truthwatchers is an order of the knights radiant on roshar. the truthwatchers are surgebinders who used the surges of illumination and progression, and they are associated with the emerald polestone. they form a nahel bond with mistspren. philosophy[edit] those who join the truthwatchers generally subscribe to a philosophy of finding the ultimate truth and sharing it. the order is concerned with the fundamental truths of the universe, and whether or not those in power are being truthful with the people they lead. a small percentage of truthwatchers are greatly concerned with the actions of the powerful and might be likened to investigative reporters. the order will make their opinions known loudly and forcefully, particularly if they think someone in power is abusing that power or lying about fundamental truths. they tend to attract scientists, scholars, or thinkers of all types. divine attributes of the truthwatchers are learned and giving. ideals of the truthwatchers[edit] the ideals of the knights radiant, also known as the immortal words, are a set of rules by which the radiants live. the first ideal is shared by all of the orders, and is used as a motto for the knights radiant as a whole. each of the orders then have an additional four ideals that are unique to that order. the ideals of the order of truthwatchers all focus on seeking and sharing truth, as well as making sure it is not improperly exploited. however, unlike the lightweavers, who pursue personal truths, the truthwatchers are concerned more with uncovering the greater secrets of the universe. the first ideal[edit] ""“life before death, strength before weakness, journey before destination. ”-the first ideal of the knights radiant"" abilities[edit] the truthwatchers use the surges of progression and illumination. progression[edit] progression can be manipulated to alter the growth and healing of organisms. it is described as ""the surge of growth and healing, or regrowth"". this ability heals the damage done to the body and the soul of a person instantly and without any scarring. illumination[edit] illumination is used to craft illusions by weaving light, sound and various waveforms. this can be used to change their appearance for disguises or other purposes, create illusions of walls and rocks to hide behind and in, and to create illusions to confuse or distract. there are some differences in how they use the surge compared to lightweavers. enlightened[edit] truthwatchers who have had their mistspren enlightened by sja-anat have different abilities from standard truthwatchers. progression remains normal, still allowing the healing of themselves and others. where standard truthwatchers can use illumination to create illusions, enlightened ones can only summon lights, which can sometimes act in strange and unnatural ways. deeper connection to rhythms can alter the truthwatcher's abilities slightly. an enlightened truthwatcher will have different oaths from a standard one. this bond also allows the radiant to see the visions of past and future events. renarin stated that this is because truthwatchers are unique because ""they see"". visions are shown through dark glass and show possible outcomes, but are not always accurate. other people are not able to see this glass. they do not come specifically from odium, but since their powers come from him it is possible that his desires influence what the visions will show. this also has the added benefit of causing others who see the future to see the truthwatcher and those close to them as a black spot, as those who see the future cause a conflict in fortune. the ability to see the future is related to the voidbinding chart, though the precise relationship between the powers and voidbinding remains unclear. history[edit] the ancient truthwatchers were often scientists, scholars and thinkers; this led to them being perceived as quiet and rather esoteric in their pursuits. they tended to be reserved, though a group of them was always dedicated to monitoring the actions of the people in power on roshar, and making their opinions on said actions heard far and wide if necessary. they particularly concerned themselves with abuse of power, as well as finding out the truth, though what constituted ""truth"" was a subject of some debate. truthwatchers would often engage in enthusiastic discussions on the topic of philosophy, particularly concerning the truth, even if many such conversations would take place only in writing. they were also interested in the more obscure crafts and sciences, such as new fabrials or technologies. modern truthwatchers are few and far between, scattered around the world rather than united. notable truthwatchers[edit] - (bonded to - ) - , or arshqqam (bonded to - ) - (bonded to - ) quotes[edit] ""“now, as the truthwatchers were esoteric in nature, their order being formed entirely of those who never spoke or wrote of what they did, in this lies frustration for those who would see their exceeding secrecy from the outside;

Jenet,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Jenet,"jenet is the stablemaster of the kholin warcamp's stables on the shattered plains. appearance and personality[edit] ""“all right, listen up, soldier boys! we’re going to do this properly. i won’t have you hurting my horses, all right? you listen, and you listen well. ”-jenet, to bridge four"" jenet is a pretty woman who wears her dark hair up in a simple tail with no ornaments. her face is rather taut, which kaladin finds strange for a lighteyes. she wears a riding dress, a havah made of a coarse material that has slits from ankle to thigh up the front and back, with feminine trousers underneath. she wears a sleeve over her safehand, even though most of the female grooms wear a glove. she is rather standoffish and is openly displeased by dalinar's orders to teach a bunch of soldiers how to ride horses. she is very curt with kaladin and she is blunt enough to tell him that he needs his hair cut, despite his rank as a captain. she also hurls rocks in annoyance at prince adolin kholin. she generally lacks refinement and polish in her interactions, which kaladin finds refreshing in a lighteyed woman. jenet was attracted to horse grooming because it is not addressed as a ""masculine"" or ""feminine"" art in the sacred vorin text arts and majesty, allowing both men and women to do the job. despite her youth, she is dalinar's most trusted stablemaster. she is extremely knowledgeable about horses and a large team of grooms, both men and women, report to her. she cares deeply for the horses and their safety, expressing concern when dalinar orders them to be used on patrol outside the camps. history[edit] at some point she was presumably involved in a failed relationship with adolin, as she threw rocks at him when he attempted to exchange pleasantries with her. ""“you dropped the reins. storming fool! were you even listening?”-jenet, to moash"" dalinar ordered her to train bridge four and the other bridgemen under his service in horse riding. she was not happy to be teaching beginners, and gave a very long, protracted, and thorough lesson on horse riding before allowing the bridgemen to touch the animals. she was particularly concerned about the horses getting spooked. once the bridgemen began riding the horses, she was easily frustrated with any mistakes that they made. she seemed both incredulous and amused when kaladin, who was being mocked by adolin for riding the aging spray, said he was going to ride dreamstorm. jenet seemed more worried about the horse's safety than kaladin's. she watched in both horror and awe as kaladin briefly rode dreamstorm (with the help of stormlight) until the point that he was thrown off. after dalinar agreed to let the bridgemen begin patrols outside of the warcamps, he instructed them to bring some horses with them to practice. jenet was immediately perturbed by the idea of taking horses outside of the city due to her concerns about bandits, but dalinar overruled her and told her that the horses were there to be used. trivia[edit] - ""jenet"" is a gender-neutral name in - , as kaladin assumed that the stablemaster was a man before meeting her. - brandon used both his real-life horseback riding experiences and advice from horse experts in order to write jenet's scene. notes[edit]"
Jakamav,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Jakamav,"jakamav is a lighteyes of the third dahn from highprince roion's camp and one of his various landlords. appearance and personality[edit] jakamav is a sturdy alethi man with pale green eyes. he has an infectious laugh and seems to attract friends and women fairly easily. he does not find the concept of marriage appealing. adolin counts him as a friend, and jakamav fights by his side and provides him with advice. however, adolin later realizes that jakamav's reputation is more important to him then actually supporting adolin. jakamav openly questions dalinar's actions in front of adolin on several occasions and proves willing to betray adolin for shards. attributes and abilities[edit] he owns green painted shardplate and uses a shardhammer in battle. he does not own a shardblade but is capable of using one, having trained with borrowed blades. he would likely be able to win a shardblade in a duel, but his house does not want to risk his plate. he experiences the thrill in battle and enjoys fighting the parshendi. although roion's army won the fewest gemhearts among the highprinces, jakamav's status as a landlord and shardbearer presumably make him fairly wealthy. he has stewards who attend to him after battles. he is among the best duelists in the warcamps, and trained alongside adolin. however, he is overconfident; he once refused zahel's offer to train him to fight off a spearman with a knife, laughing at the idea that a shardbearer would ever fight knife to spear. - images of jakamav history[edit] jakamav presumably lived on the shattered plains from a relatively young age. he trained under zahel with adolin. he accompanied inkima to a wine house in the outer market for a tasting with adolin kholin, danlan morakotha, toral, and eshava. inkima seemed quite taken with jamakav, giggling at most of his comments, even the unfunny ones. he was still seeing inkima some time later, although he seemed to have a negative view of long-term relationships. jakamav was part of roion and ruthar's plateau run which adolin assisted with. both men ended up climbing a cliff face during the battle to fight parshendi, but they did not find a gemheart, instead encountering eshonai. adolin wanted to fight her, although jakamav preferred to retreat. afterwards, he told adolin that someone (presumably torol sadeas) had been making promises to shardbearers so that they would refuse duels with adolin. jakamav advised adolin that there was a chance that eranniv would accept a challenge. he also told adolin that it would be bad for his reputation to be seen with him, due to growing unease among the other highprinces with regard to dalinar. he was among the many shardbearers present at a meeting of the alethi highprinces regarding the danger of the assassin in white. jakamav was accompanying roion as part of his guard against a potential assassination attempt. disadvantaged duel[edit] jakamav was one of the three shardbearers who joined relis ruthar in his duel against adolin, and was most likely promised a share of the spoils should adolin have been defeated. he was armed with a king's blade that relis had borrowed. adolin initially managed to hold his own, but jakamav waited for an opportune time to join the fight and overwhelm him. jakamav and the other shardbearers might have killed or permanently injured adolin if renarin had not appeared in the arena and distracted them. when adolin asked jakamav why he was participating, he did not respond. after kaladin subsequently joined the fight, jakamav continued to attack adolin, scoring several hits on his plate. he also engaged kaladin, who was able to block his blows using a shield improvised from a helm. jakamav was the last of relis's team to remain in the duel, but he was eventually forced to yield when adolin wrestled him to the ground and kaladin pressed a knife to an opening in his armor. he was annoyed that adolin and kaladin resorted to grappling tactics in order to win, but they did not break any rules. jakamav lost his plate in the duel and was not heard from again in the warcamps. notes[edit]"
Lighteyes,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Brightlord,"a lighteyes is a person with lightly colored, bright eyes, such as blue, green, yellow, light grey, or violet. in the vorin kingdoms of alethkar, jah keved, and kharbranth, they form the nobility, ruling over the darkeyes. lighteyes are ranked in ten different levels, in accordance with the dahn caste system. overview[edit] according to the vorin religion, all lighteyes are born to rule and are superior to the darkeyes, leading to a class system based on eye color. the defining characteristic of a lighteyes is not merely the actual color of their eyes, but that they have a light and distinguishable color. for example, although grey is not normally considered a bright color, having light grey eyes qualifies one as a lighteyes. conversely, although green is normally seen as a light color, having deep, dark green eyes that look muddled and is hard to distinguish from brown or black in average light would qualify one as a darkeyes. a male lighteyes of notable rank is addressed by the title brightlord. similarly, brightlady is used to address high-ranking females, although the more common term of address is brightness. brightness can be used to address a lighteyed lady of any rank. sometimes when important lighteyes die, their corpses are soulcast into stone or metal statues. this practice sometimes extends to wealthy darkeyes as well, but darkeyes corpses are typically burned instead. conversely, the method of final disposition of the corpses of lighteyes of lower dahn is unknown. this practice is observed in both alethkar and jah keved, despite the rarity of soulcasters even in nations as powerful as jah keved, and likely extends to other vorin nations. changing eye color[edit] permanently changing one's birth eye color is generally not possible. however, two exceedingly rare methods are currently known to change one's eye color. it is a well-known legend within vorin society that if a man wins a shardblade on the battlefield, he will become a lighteyes, regardless of his previous station in life. even if his eye color didn't physically change, he would still be promoted to fourth dahn by virtue of being a shardbearer. the exact color of the shardbearer's eyes depends on the specific type of blade they bonded to. this legend, though a foundation of vorin society, went untested for centuries, until adolin kholin won a full set of shards and gifted them to the former bridgeman kaladin stormblessed. kaladin, remembering the event in which his friends were killed, stepped aside and commanded his lieutenant, moash, to take the shards. upon receiving the shards, moash's eyes did indeed lighten, from a dark brown to a tan color. this effect lasts only as long as the formerly darkeyed shardbearer keeps ownership of his shardblade, as moash's eyes changed again upon losing his. a second method of becoming a lighteyes is to become either a surgebinder or knight radiant. according to skar, kaladin's eyes changed while fighting to save dalinar during the battle of the tower, although it was only for a short moment, as other men still recognize him as a darkeyes during the fight. during this battle, kaladin only said up to the second ideal of the immortal words and did not recognize himself as a knight radiant. later, during the battle of narak, after kaladin says the third ideal of the immortal words and recognizes himself as a true knight radiant, his eyes turn pale blue, lighter than any king. they stay pale blue for several hours after summoning syl before returning to brown, and kaladin has to summon syl several times a day to keep his eye blue. the longer a person is a radiant, the longer it takes for their eyes to turn back. lighteyes can temporarily be darkened using eyedrops. there is not currently a way to artificially lighten dark eye colors. origins[edit] it is speculated that the distinction between lighteyes and darkeyes stems from the knights radiant. the knights radiant all used surgebinding and shards, which granted them light-colored eyes even if they didn't have them at birth. because the weapons and magic that the radiants wielded were so superior, the belief that light colored eyes being superior to dark colored ones came to be. the bond between spren and humans is what actually causes the color change. hoid thinks that he should be amused by the importance given to the color of one's eyes, but he isn't, since he has seen other arbitrary systems of governance; additionally, he recalls that there is a good reason why the belief in the superiority of lighteyes came to be. dahn[edit] dahn rankings[edit] anything italicized is speculated here. the position of citylord, may span multiple dahn, including fourth, fifth, and sixth. the dahn of the appointed citylord may be based on the size and significance of a settlement. general dahn information[edit] dahn is the caste system for lighteyes. its counterpart for darkeyes is the nahn system. since lighteyes are nobility in the vorin kingdoms, the dahn system is superior to the nahn system. holding even the tenth and lowest dahn socially outranks the highest level of nahn. however, there are situations in which practical reality makes the social standing between two persons less relevant or even reversed. for an extreme example, after kaladin, a darkeyes, was promoted to captain, he was socially outranked by many lighteyed soldiers, yet still possessed higher military rank and authority than them. a worker, such as a carriage driver, would treat a wealthy darkeyes as any other master, since their wages would be paid by the darkeyed passenger. within the dahn system itself, there are ten different levels ranging from one to ten, with one being the highest and ten being the lowest. the highest levels of dahn implies immense power and authority while those at the lowest level of dahn are merely ordinary people. the first dahn consists of the king. during the period when alethkar was a powerful nation but not unified, the ten ruling highprinces were only second dahn. rulers of smaller nations like kharbranth, bavland or silnasen would accept the role of second dahn to avoid antagonizing the alethi, though the rulers of jah keved and thaylen had enough clout to consider their rulers to be first dahn, and a nation like herdaz wouldn't generally care if they upset the alethi. the second dahn contains the highprinces. the third dahn is made up, at least in part, of the non-heir children of the king, the non-heir children of highprinces, and highlords. the fourth dahn includes lighteyes who hold the position of battalionlord in the army; battalionlords command a full battalion of a thousand men. the seventh dahn includes lower ranking officers in the army who are landless and attached to a more powerful officer's retinue. people in the tenth and lowest level of dahn are colloquially known as ""tenners"" and are looked down upon as being barely above darkeyes. unlike high dahn lighteyes-who might make a living from their landed estates or by ruling over other men-or even high nahn darkeyes-who might be merchants or master craftsmen-tenners have to actually work for a living. moving between ranks[edit] it is difficult for a lighteyed person to raise their dahn, especially at the higher dahns. at the lower dahns, one can buy themselves up a rank. alternatively, one can be appointed to a position; a position such as a citylord conveys a certain rank and if the person does not currently have that rank, they will receive it along with the appointment. a person can potentially jump up two or three dahns by receiving such an appointment. one can raise his dahn through two other, much more rare, methods. the first is through direct intervention by the king or a highprince. the second is to become a shardbearer; by doing so, one immediately raises his dahn to that of the fourth rank, if he is not already at or above this rank. a person can also be demoted in dahn if they perform poorly in a given role. in particular, if an ardent leaves the ardentia, he will be demoted to the tenth dahn. inheritance of dahn[edit] the dahn of a lighteyed child is influenced by the dahn that his parents hold. generally, the child's dahn will be equivalent to the highest dahn that either of his parents hold. for example, a child from a union of a fifth dahn husband and sixth dahn wife would be fifth dahn. however, special rules apply to those of very high dahn or who hold certain special positions. in such a circumstance, the heir apparent will receive the highest parent's dahn and eventually succeed the parent's position while the non-heir children will slip one or two ranks down until they reach a ""stable rank."" a stable rank is one in which the child will always inherit the rank of their parent; the third dahn is a stable rank, while the first and second are not. notable lighteyes[edit] first dahn[edit] - king - , king of - . - queen - , queen of - (a ruler in her own right instead of marriage, in defiance of - tradition). - king - , former king of - . - king - , former king of alethkar. - king - , former king of - . - king - , former king of jah keved - king - , former king of jah keved, and - . - queen - , queen of - . second dahn[edit] alethkar[edit] - queen - , queen of urithiru. - queen - , queen of alethkar. - prince - , heir to alethkar. - highprince - . - highprincess - prince - , heir to the - . - highprince - , - . - highprince - . - highprince - , - . - highprince - , - . - highprince - . jah keved[edit] third dahn[edit] - , landlord and - under highprince roion. fourth dahn[edit] - , lieutenant of the bridgemen and shardbearer under highprince dalinar. - , head of - and shallan's father. - , shallan's brother. - , shallan's brother.

Chanasha Hasareh,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Chanasha,"chanasha hasareh is a merchant on roshar. she found modest success hiring out her chull teams to caravans crossing the shattered plains after most of the alethi relocated to urithiru. chanasha is lighteyed, although she is of a low dahn. she is presumably of the vorin faith, as she wears a safehand sleeve. she is not the smiling type, and seems to be known as a shrewd negotiator. she always carries a reed in her pocket and never lets a day go by without reconciling her accounts. her name is derived from the herald chanaranach. she was bribed to hide in a secure location for a month while shallan impersonated her as part of an attempt to infiltrate the sons of honor. notes[edit]"
Peet,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Peet,"peet is a member of bridge four on roshar and a windrunner. appearance and personality[edit] peet is lean and balding with an oval face. others see him as quietly dependable. attributes and abilities[edit] peet is trained in the use of the spear. he is also a windrunner, having sworn at least the first ideal of the knights radiant. this allows him to draw in stormlight and use the surges of gravitation and adhesion. history[edit] bridgeman[edit] peet was one of the members of bridge four who stubbornly resisted kaladin's efforts to take charge of the group. he did, however, assist kaladin by fetching a watergourd for him while he did some basic field surgery on leyten on a bridge run. he and narm were wounded in one of the first bridge runs after kaladin's decision to save bridge four, adding to the number of bridgemen from the crew who still needed food but drew no pay. after kaladin healed from his time in the highstorm, he found that peet and hobber had both healed enough to join in again with carrying the bridge. later, the crew gave rock a gift in appreciation of his nightly stew, and peet pointed out to him that besides the razor there were also a piece of polished steel for a mirror, some soap, and a strop for sharpening. when brightlord hashal replaced lamaril as captain over the bridgemen, he assigned bridge four permanently to chasm duty. peet grew worried and asked kaladin what they would do, not knowing that kaladin himself was dealing with growing doubts that he would be able to help bridge four at all. later, in the chasms, kaladin offered to train the bridgemen to use a spear in preparation for an eventual escape attempt, and the entire group agreed to his plan. bridge four trained in the chasms until they had rudimentary skill as spearmen and used the bridge runs to practice their method of using parshendi carapace as armor that would draw the enemy's attention to a select few bridgemen instead of the group at large. peet and the rest of the bridge four went on the joint assault between dalinar and torol sadeas that culminated in the battle of the tower. after sadeas' betrayal, when kaladin noticed him retreating, he told rock and peet to take the wounded teft and help him along. ""““stormfather,” peet whispered. “what … what is he?” “he’s our bridgeleader,” teft said.”-after kaladin swears the second ideal"" bridge four had an opportunity to escape the army with their bridge on the way from the tower back to the warcamp, but the men all wholeheartedly backed kaladin's decision to return to the tower to aid dalinar. after kaladin spoke the second ideal of the windrunners, peet was stunned by what he saw as kaladin singlehandedly took on the parshendi at the far end of their bridge. dalinar traded oathbringer for the lives of all of sadeas' bridgemen, bringing them over to his warcamp and offering them a place in his army. that night around the fire, kaladin showed the men his ability to breathe in stormlight and explained that he didn't know much about his abilities. rock suggested throwing kaladin off a cliff, and peet, missing the humor of rock's novel way to get kaladin to manifest his powers, wanted to know what good that would do. freedom[edit] peet and the rest of bridge four, accepting positions as dalinar's guards, undertook the duties of guarding the kholins and training the rest of the brigemen to turn them into soldiers. as free men, they sometimes went out into the market on free evenings; peet met a barmaid named ka at the ornery chull during these trips and began showing interest in her. on the excursion when kaladin joined peet, sigzil, moash, and rock on their trip to the tavern, peet was able to secure them a table only because of his relationship with ka. sigzil, seeing the two of them interact, was prompted to discuss housing for married members of bridge four with kaladin, who had not given a thought to the issue. once the group was seated, peet joined in the discussion as rock related the story of the creation of the horneater peaks until ka came by again and peet got up to help her bus the tables. ""“peet closed the door, then looked at adolin, raising an eyebrow. great. now he was getting attitude from the bridgemen.”-after relis confronts adolin"" as the kholin family guards, bridge four supplied members to guard adolin as well as dalinar and the king; on the day of adolin's duel against elit, peet and another bridgeman were on duty in adolin's staging room. after relis stormed in to confront adolin, the bridgemen witnessed adolin make his disastrous agreement to fight relis and ""whomever"" he would bring. bridge four accompanied dalinar on his expedition to stormseat that culminated in the battle of narak and the discovery of urithiru. peet was part of the group that went with shallan to explore the plateau that turned out to be an oathgate platform. he returned to dalinar to tell him the alethi armies needed to get onto that plateau to escape the converging everstorm and highstorm. shallan succeeded in transporting them all to urithiru, after which peet and the others of bridge four who had survived the battle returned to the shattered plains to await kaladin's return from his fight with szeth. windrunner squire[edit] ""“peet, don’t think i haven’t seen you glowing. ”-kaladin"" after moving into urithiru, groups of soldiers and scouts, including bridge four, explored the city's maze-like tunnels. on one scouting trip, bridge four discovered sadeas' corpse. when they later found the body of vedekar perel, peet noted that it looked remarkably like what happened to sadeas. later, he and leyten discovered oathbringer in a planter, where it had fallen after adolin threw it out the window. they showed the shardblade to dalinar, who took possession of it again. sometime after vacating the warcamps in favor of urithiru, peet and ka became betrothed. sigzil, seeing that their impending marriage presented a deadline of sorts, brought up to kaladin for the second time the issue of requisitioning housing for married members of bridge four. as he was one of the first members of bridge four to become a squire, kaladin assigned peet to teach a group of bridgemen how to breathe in stormlight during a windrunner squire recruiting session. later that day, hobber used some stormlight to heal his legs, and drehy and peet were the first ones there to help him stand for the first time. during another of the training sessions, peet trained the ten newest squires, including lyn and colot, leading them in practice with lashings. after kaladin left on the expedition to kholinar, dalinar lent bridge four jezrien's honorblade so they could continue practicing with their windrunner powers. peet was with the group that accompanied dalinar to thaylen city to check on amaram's progress helping rebuild the city and to meet with queen fen and the other monarchs who had joined their coalition. after the eila stele's translation was distributed to the coalition, bridge four left the city and returned to urithiru. when they arrived back at the barracks, they discovered rock and bisig injured and unconscious in the barracks while eth, the one who had held the honorblade that day, was dead. peet tended to bisig and suggested that rock be treated by renarin. shortly after, bisig regained consciousness enough to relate to them what had transpired. after defeating an invasion of parshendi, the new full windrunner teft led bridge four and a division of alethi soldiers through urithiru's oathgate into the middle of the battle of thaylen field. later, at taravangian's request during the post-battle efforts, teft, leyten, and peet transported a twenty-foot square platform carrying the wounded towards the upper city. windrunner[edit] following the battle at thaylen city, peet bonded a spren of his own. he likely participated in the evacuation of hearthstone with his fellow windrunners, engaging the fused in combat, before returning to urithiru. following kaladin's retirement, peet and a majority of the bridge four windrunners joined dalinar's forces on the battlefield in emul. following the occupation of urithiru, peet returned for teft's funeral, along with the rest of bridge four. trivia[edit] - peet is a cameo for - , - assistant and friend. notes[edit]"
Lavis,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lavis,"lavis is a species of plant from the rockbud family. it is an important and ancient cereal crop on roshar. cultivation[edit] lavis is grown on hillsides across roshar. lavis fields are typically planted in the seasons following the weeping, when the highstorms are weaker. a mixture of lavis seeds and stumpweight sap is spread across the hillsides. as the dark brown polyps begin to grow, they have to be wormed. farmers must carefully go over each polyp searching for worm burrows. the worms like sugar, so they can be removed by inserting a reed tipped with sugar into the burrow and pulling it out when the worm latches on. once the worm is removed, the polyp can be patched with crem. each field can take weeks to check and it is important to check repeatedly for worms since any worm that is missed results in the loss of the entire polyp. the crop can be fertilized during the worming process. mature lavis polyps are filled with grains suspended in a sandy material. they are broken open, and the grain is separated from the grit and typically dried for storage. there are different strains of lavis. the variety grown in hearthstone has polyps that grow larger than a man's head and mature in about four months. there are smaller, heartier strains that can thrive in regions where the highstorms are stronger. it is also grown around the warcamps on the shattered plains. after the coalition sets up headquarters in urithiru, dalinar initiates large-scale farming on the shattered plains. this is part of the reason why he agrees to fetch the residents of hearthstone, as many of them are farmers. when the highstorm stops happening, the farmers of tashikk start planting lavis, tallew and clema during their rest period. kaladin also comments on this when he first travels back to hearthstone. hatham's farmers fail to cultivate lavis in urithiru, presumably either until rlain shows them how the parshendi combine stormlight, a certain rhythm, and lifespren to sustain rockbuds on stormlight or until the sibling activates the tower. uses[edit] lavis is a staple food source and is prepared in many ways. a common version of chouta is stuffed with flangria that has been mixed with ground lavis, formed into small balls, and then battered and fried. by itself, lavis can also be made into kuma by crushing it together with spices. it can be steamed as a side to broths or curries. it can be made into a ration bar by mixing it with sugar, which holds the bar together. it can also be fermented into lavis ale or distilled into honu, a hard liquor. the fibres that lavis produces can be used for rudimentary clothing, as dalinar sees in his lake fortress vision. economy[edit] lavis grain is the basis of the economy in many small towns like hearthstone. sebarial considers it a lucrative enough crop to include as an important part of the economy he builds in his warcamp on the shattered plains. the akanny region of sadeas princedom in which hearthstone lies is especially fertile for growing both lavis and tallew, potentially feeding half of alethkar with their yield. lavis grain typically goes through several merchant middle-men on its way from the farming communities to the cities. by the time people buy it in the city, it usually costs four to five times as much as the farmers sell it for. it is handed out as a ration in kholinar when the parshendi besiege the city. ships often take barrels of lavis onboard to feed the crew; occasionally a barrel will have dormant larvae in them, rendering the lavis inedible to humans when the worms mature. the hexi nomads, however, prize just such worm-ridden grain and are eager to buy it. armies also sustain themselves largely on soulcast food, including lavis grain, when they have the advantage of access to soulcasters. it is difficult to soulcast things into true lavis with individual grains; less advanced soulcasters typically can only create a block of hardened lavis pulp which can then be chipped off and cooked into a mush. notes[edit]"
Dul,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Dul,"dul is a singer on roshar. a former parshman, he is a member of venli's group of singers that wishes to be free of the fused. appearance and personality[edit] dul is a tall malen singer. his skin is red with small hints of black. in mediationform, he has an open face and smooth carapace. dul is pragmatic, loyal, and trustworthy. he also has a sense of humor. he picked up a few human mannerisms and customs from his time as a parshman, but he still speaks and hums to the old rhythms. he fervently wants to escape the rule of the fused, so much so that it can bring him to tears. attributes and abilities[edit] dul is a common singer and is capable of bonding various spren within his gemheart to wear different forms. he wears the rarely seen mediationform, and it is implied that he uses other forms as well. history[edit] during the war of reckoning, dul served as a parshman in alethkar along with his mate, mazish. he almost never spoke to his master. he once asked if he and mazish could be married in the human tradition, as they followed certain alethi customs; his request was angrily denied. after the coming of the everstorm, dul and mazish's minds were awakened and they joined (or were conscripted into) odium's forces. however, they soon became some of the first singers recruited by venli to join her resistance movement. the couple were able to get married after they were freed. dul became a friend of venli's and one of the most trusted members of her inner circle. he was able to gain the position of stormsetter for leshwi's high chamber in kholinar. he assisted venli with her subterfuge and maintained some level of oversight of new recruits; he advised them on how to act around the fused. he was present when shumin became leshwi's assistant stormsetter, and subsequently attended a meeting with her in venli's quarters. he lightly admonished shumin for being inadequately prepared for leshwi's tests. dul and mazish were presumably part of venli's team that left kholinar for urithiru before the singers invaded the tower. in urithiru, dul continued to work with venli to try and figure out a way to escape the fused. although he seemed nearly demoralized at times, he continued doing whatever venli needed him to do. she was able to put him in charge of watching the fallen knights radiant after raboniel's partial corruption of the tower's defenses. he continued to check in with venli, and also hoarded supplies in anticipation of fleeing the fused. dul was among the team of fifteen singers that venli planned to covertly evacuate to kholinar before fleeing to the shattered plains. after leshwi's rebellion and the liberation of the tower, dul presumably went to the shattered plains via oathgate with the rest of venli's objectors, seeking to join the other listeners. notes[edit]"
Adin,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Adin,"adin is a darkeyed boy living in urithiru on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] adin is a thirteen-year-old darkeyed boy. he is very brave, risking his life in the fight to escape urithiru. he hopes that his bravery will attract an honorspren and allow him to join the windrunners. this belief caused him to glare at passing regals during the occupation of urithiru, though not when they were watching. he is relieved when he can walk without a limp after hurting his ankle, as he believes that a sign of weakness might scare off a potential radiant bond. history[edit] adin was a resident of urithiru during the true desolation. he worked for his father, a potter named alalan, though the bowls he made were often lopsided. sometime before raboniel's invasion of the tower, he fell down the stairs while pretending to be a windrunner, after which kaladin bandaged his ankle and told him to walk with a crutch. his ankle got better later on, so when his father wanted to watch a battle in urithitu, adin followed to help and earn his own spren. when the humans protected the fallen radiants, adin first tried to hide and only joined the fight later on when his father was already wounded. during the battle, adin feared for his life, but both he and his father survived as they were saved by dabbid and kaladin, who had just earned his shardplate. relationships[edit] alalan[edit] adin's father. when alalan catches adin glaring at the regals, he warns him to keep his eyes down, lest he is caught and killed. adin views his father as extremely brave for tending the fallen radiants directly beneath the gaze of the fused. kaladin[edit] adin respects and reveres kaladin, viewing him with a sense of awe. he is embarrassed that he missed seeing kaladin fight for the well node, an event that he napped through. shar[edit] shar is the daughter of a seamstress in urithiru which adin doesn't particularly like. according to him, she is bossy enough that one would think she is lighteyed. her uncle is a windrunner. when adin catches her glaring at regals he thinks that she is trying to attract her own honorspren. master liganor[edit] master liganor is the lighteyed owner of the pottery adin's father is working at. adin thinks he is nice and appreciates the bravery of keeping the shop open during the occupation, though he did close the shop when a fight broke out. notes[edit]"
Sigzil,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sigzil,"sigzil, also known as nomad or zellion, is an azish member of bridge four on roshar, a companylord of the radiant order of windrunners, and later a skybreaker and dawnshard. he was previously apprenticed to hoid and is now a full worldsinger. appearance and personality[edit] ""“my master trained me to ask questions, so i’m asking them. ”-sigzil"" appearance[edit] sigzil is clean-shaven with dark brown skin and thick, curly black hair. he is considered average height in azir, which makes him short compared to most alethi. he has a bridge four tattoo on his forehead covering the place where he used to be branded with a slave mark. personality[edit] sigzil tends to be quiet and close-mouthed, though when he embraces his role as a worldsinger, he displays deep knowledge of a variety of cultures and speaks openly and volubly. he seems to enjoy deep conversations, especially when conducted one-on-one, and has a formal way of speaking. he also has a judgmental streak, particularly around disorderly people or when faced with other cultures' less organized and bureaucratic methods. he is not very accepting of homosexuality, shaped by azish views on the subject. though he doesn't necessarily mistreat drehy despite his views. taking hoid's teachings to heart, however, he does attempt to be more open-minded. despite being incredibly organized and studious, sigzil thinks less of himself for failing the governmental service exams in azir. likely as a result of growing up in a country where everything is well-organized, he prefers a clear relationship between himself and whomever he works for. he also expresses the need to figure out exactly what bridge four's chain of command is in regards to alethi affairs after the beginning of the true desolation. despite his penchant for keeping this organized, sigzil is not content with only being a clerk, and wants to be the ""first into the sky,"" rather than spending all his time poring over ledgers. he is encouraging and optimistic to his friends. attributes and abilities[edit] sigzil has been trained with the spear and spearman tactics by kaladin, and he uses the weapon ""acceptably."" he can read and write the azish script, though out of deference to alethi ideals he sticks with using glyphs to record written reports as bridge four's clerk. his understanding of other cultures, ability to work easily with numbers, and his level-headedness are all assets to the order of windrunners. sigzil also speaks alethi and malwish. unlike most people, sigzil is connected to two places; roshar and canticle. surgebinding[edit] sigzil has bonded an honorspren and has sworn at least the fourth ideal of the order of windrunners, which allows him to draw in stormlight and use the surges of gravitation and adhesion. eventually, his bond was broken (although he retained some control over his old powers) and he bonded a highspren known as auxiliary, reaching at least the fourth ideal of that order as well. with these bonds, sigzil has access to both shardblade and shardplate. after being exposed to canticle's sun, his shardplate burns with red-orange light, and trails smoke. dawnshard[edit] when sigzil was thirty-eight years old he was given a dawnshard by hoid. this gave him enhancements in durability, strength, endurance, and healing. this has now allowed him to form connections to planets though these abilities need some investiture to function. a side effect of holding and having held this dawnshard prevents sigzil from being unable to physically harm others, with his body locking up whenever he tries to attack. sigzil comes to refer to this effect as his torment, though not all others affected this way would refer to it as such. he is able to mitigate this using a sunheart he took from canticle, allowing him to fight as normal by pushing some of the unwanted investiture into it. this investiture is then filtered and purified, allowing sigzil to absorb it to fuel his abilities. skipping[edit] after becoming a dawnshard, he gained the ability to skip to other worlds. when he has enough investiture, he can quickly travel to other planets via the connection to all places that the dawnshard granted to him. each skip requires approximately 20,000 breath equivalent units of investiture to be initiated. his skip destinations are seemingly random, but are known to be attracted to sources of investiture. therefore, it is very unlikely for him to end up on a planet where natural sources of investiture are not present. history[edit] worldsinger[edit] sigzil was the first person in his family in generations to have a chance at passing the governmental service tests in azir, which would have given him the opportunity to attend a ""real"" school, though he later came to consider that a ""silly dream,"" since, as the son of a laborer, he had little time to study. before taking the tests, however, he got into some sort of trouble and had to be rescued by hoid, who took him on as an apprentice worldsinger. hoid and sigzil traveled to many places on roshar together, including to babatharnam, where hoid had to pay to have sigzil freed from prison on three separate occasions. while they were on the shattered plains, he attempted to kill someone and thought he was successful, though his victim actually survived. this event appears to be what caused him to be made a bridgeman. sometime after kaladin joined bridge four, he believed that hoid thought he was dead. bridge four[edit] after kaladin started trying to rehabilitate bridge four, sigzil was abrasive and scornful of his efforts at first, among the loudest critics. he was also shy about his knowledge as a worldsinger and walked off when rock mentioned his being one. over time, however, he began to warm up and tell stories about far-off places like marabethia, yulay, babatharnam, and shinovar. after kaladin was healed enough from being strung up in a highstorm to go on bridge runs again, he, rock, and sigzil observed a battle and discussed the tactics behind putting the bridgemen's lives in such danger. that evening, impressed by sigzil's earlier analysis, kaladin discussed with him the education in each of their pasts while the others got their stew. in the chasms one time while on duty, sigzil happened on teft's conversation with kaladin and expanded on the first ideal of the lost radiants. those words stuck in kaladin's head and gave him the courage to suggest training the men with spears in preparation for an escape attempt; sigzil wholeheartedly agreed to the plan, as did the rest. ""“i do not ‘give tales.’ i spread knowledge of cultures, peoples, thoughts, and dreams. i bring peace through understanding.”-sigzil, to bridge four in the chasms"" one day after kaladin had his beard shaved off for the first time since his time in amaram's army, sigzil discussed with him whether or not he would like to take the lighteyes' place and rule alethkar. he brought up babatharnam to illustrate the point that eye color was not the problem so much as people with power abusing their positions, then stalked off when rock pointed out that he sounded like a worldsinger. another time on chasm duty, sigzil reluctantly agreed to fill his role as a worldsinger and confirmed that what kaladin had seen in his vision during a highstorm was real by telling about sesemalex dar, though he protested at the group's requests for ""stories."" he was the one to tell kaladin about the parshendi's reverence for their dead, planting the seeds for kaladin's later idea about crafting armor from their corpses. one night, when kaladin went out wandering on the plains, he crossed paths with hoid, who was playing his flute. hoid told kaladin the story of the wandersail before telling kaladin to take good care of sigzil and to inform him that he had been graduated and was now a full worldsinger. when kaladin tried to ask sigzil about hoid, he refused to discuss his former master. sigzil's change of attitude towards kaladin was made very apparent during the battle of the tower when kaladin told the bridge crew to run away but to leave him behind; sigzil was the first to speak up, flatly refusing to leave him. he was overawed by kaladin's skill with the spear as kaladin defended the bridge against the parshendi just after he spoke the words of the second ideal and talked him into giving them a demonstration of drawing in stormlight while they sat around the fire that evening in dalinar kholin's warcamp. he immediately began thinking analytically about kaladin's powers, plying him with questions to see how much he could quantify the powers he had experienced, and devising experiments to be able to do just that. lieutenant[edit] after dalinar secured the lives of the bridgemen and bridge four transfered to dalinar's army, kaladin promoted sigzil to the rank of lieutenant and appointed him the bridge crew's clerk, since he was the only member of bridge four who could read glyphs. he joined with the rest of the crew when they got ""freedom"" and ""bridge four"" glyphs tattooed on their foreheads over their slave brands. sigzil devised experiments to measure and document the extent of kaladin's windrunner abilities and finally put them into practice the day kaladin, teft, rock, lopen, and he led the first group of forty bridgemen into the chasms to train them. when he realized there were too many variables for his experiments to be meaningful, however, they changed tactics and practiced fighting against kaladin to give him an opportunity to put his abilities to practical use. sigzil sent regular reports to kaladin detailing the status of their troops and supplies, as well as creating routes for kaladin and teft to take the trainees on patrol beyond the warcamps. he also continued meeting with rock and lopen in the chasms to help kaladin gain control over his powers, during those times using his own former master's training to ask pointed and analytical questions about how the parshendi gained control over a shin assassin and who might have sabotaged elhokar's railing. he, lopen, and peet sometimes went to the market on nights off, accompanied at times by teft or moash. sigzil, who liked to be informed, listened to the criers' news and bought some chouta on the way to the tavern one night when kaladin was with the group. he brought up the topic of housing the married men of bridge four as they watched peet conversing with ka. when the horneater peaks came up in conversation, he started telling the others about them until rock took over and told them the horneaters' version of their creation. sigzil recognized hoid when rock mentioned meeting a white-haired god coming up from the peak ocean. the day of adolin's duel against four others, sigzil was one of forty guards kaladin brought to guard the kholins during the duel, and he spent the time before the event trying and failing to convince kaladin to reveal his powers. after kaladin was lost in the chasms on the expedition to take shallan to see a chasmfiend chrysalis, sigzil took shifts with the others awaiting his return. when he had a shift with teft, he taught him to play michim. teft revealed more about his past then than he had at any other time, feeling prompted to speak by sigzil's quiet attentiveness; sigzil listened in confidence and never revealed what he knew to the others. immediately after kaladin's return, sigzil and most of the rest of bridge four went with dalinar's army on the expedition to discover urithiru and end the war of reckoning. during the battle of narak, sigzil was one of the bridgemen who manifested the ability to use stormlight. he and the other members of bridge four who had survived the battle waited for kaladin on the plateau that served as narak's oathgate; after kaladin's return, sigzil walked him through using syl as a shardblade to activate the platform, taking them to urithiru. windrunner squire[edit] ""“i don’t want to be huddled over a ledger when bridge four takes to the air. i want to be first into the sky. ”-sigzil"" bridge four went on scouting trips to explore urithiru, and sigzil was part of the group on one of these missions when they found torol sadeas' body. later, he approached kaladin about many administrative issues the crew was facing, such as the need for a real scribe, the problem of how to accommodate the bridgemen as they pursued relationships, and their place in the army as budding windrunners. he attempted to convey the idea of why he felt some responsibility for the others' religious beliefs and social views by telling kaladin hoid's story about mishim, but failed to get the point across. as they discussed the possibility of recruitment, kaladin led him to the quartermaster's office to pick up the royal emerald reserve so bridge four could practice drawing in stormlight. kaladin told him he was glad sigzil had failed the exams in azir, and sigzil realized he felt the same; the realization liberated him. kaladin, after deciding to recruit more members to bridge four, gathered the potential windrunner squires together and assigned sigzil three squads of bridgemen to talk them through the process of drawing in stormlight. after some time of working with the recruits, rock noticed smoke on the horizon; bridge four went to investigate and discovered a caravan, including rock's family, recovering from a voidbringer attack. later, sigzil organized experiments with all of bridge four to measure the effect of the surge of gravitation and to measure the distance away from kaladin where their powers began to fade. he practiced flying with basic lashings with the rest of the crew regularly. one practice session, sigzil admitted to being one of the many members of bridge four who had come to rock to discuss how they felt they didn't fit in with the rest. after kaladin left on the expedition to kholinar, dalinar lent jezrien's honorblade to bridge four so they could continue to practice, albeit one at a time, with their windrunner powers. sigzil drew up a rotation for them, changing possession daily as an added measure of security. he was among the group that accompanied dalinar to thaylen city to check on amaram's progress helping rebuild the city and to meet with queen fen and the other monarchs who had joined their coalition. after the theft of the honorblade and teft's subsequent swearing of the third ideal, bridge four transferred to the middle of the battle of thaylen field using thaylen city's oathgate and defended the platform until the close of the battle. afterwards, the group was tasked with flying wounded up to the oathgate from the triage stations. windrunner[edit] during the following year, sigzil bonded a spren of his own, becoming a fully-fledged windrunner of the third ideal. he continued to run experiments on stormlight and lashings with kaladin, discovering that reverse lashings require one to visualize the desired outcome to work. he and others of the windrunners acted as scouts for dalinar, going on reconnaissance missions to various places. sigzil, lyn, and leyten flew to akinah, where leyten was attacked from behind by strange shadows in the clouds that drained his stormlight. lyn and sigzil were barely able to rescue leyten after his ability to use surges failed. sigzil also took part in the expedition to evacuate hearthstone, where he and the others engaged in a battle with the heavenly ones. sigzil paired off with leshwi, who managed to stab him through the chest. the blow should have been fatal, but leshwi had mercy on sigzil out of deference to kaladin, who had spared the life of another fused earlier. kaladin instructed sigzil to drop his spear, bow to leshwi, and retire from the battle to watch over the squires. ""“we windrunners … we're acting in defiance of honorspren law. we’d make the worst envoys, because of … well, they don’t much like kaladin, to be honest.”-sigzil to the coalition"" when they returned to urithiru, dalinar relieved kaladin of duty and directed him to promote some of the other windrunners. after discussing sigzil's new role with him, kaladin announced to the others that sigzil would be promoted to the rank of companylord and would oversee daily administrative matters such as supplies and recruitment. it took some time for the monarchs in the coalition to get used to sigzil as leader of and spokesman for the windrunners, as they were used to looking to kaladin. sigzil affirmed at their next meeting that the windrunners would offer support to the offensive in emul, then suggested that the coalition send an envoy to the honorspren to address the discontinuance of honorspren seeking humans to bond as radiants. he displayed a keen insight into their mindset, offering details on how the spren were likely to be thinking about humans, nahel bonds, and the recreance, but refused to go himself, explaining that the honorspren were unlikely to receive a windrunner well. emuli offensive[edit] instead, sigzil and most of the force of windrunners and squires went to emul. they were needed to fight against the skybreakers, who almost took down one of the coalition's new flying platforms that granted dalinar and the mink an aerial view of the battle before sigzil and several others flew over to chase away the attackers. dalinar looked to sigzil, as companylord, to send groups back to urithiru as scouts after the fused invasion there disrupted communications. despite finding that nothing was ostensibly wrong at the tower beyond supposed fabrial malfunctions, dalinar remained suspicious because he knew the enemy's powers would be able to put up a good front of life as usual; he asked sigzil to send a group in secret to spy out the situation. in the field, the windrunners continued their tradition of having a nightly stew for the group in their camp, and sigzil took a turn telling stories one evening when dalinar came to visit the camp to speak with renarin. later, when dalinar determined the best way to learn about his abilities as a bondsmith was to speak to the herald ishar, sigzil took a small team, including the lightweaver stargyle, to scout ishar's location. when they returned, stargyle used his abilities to create an illusion that played out what they saw as they flew over ishar's pavilion. dalinar ordered sigzil to do another scouting mission while he spoke with jasnah, though he was already decided that they would fly over to tukar to meet ishar. ""“i … don't think he’s altogether sane, despite what shalash says.”-sigzil to dalinar, about ishar"" sigzil and four other windrunners flew with dalinar and szeth to tukar. sigzil approached ishar first, landing to speak with the herald and to ensure that there was no trap set for them. he warned dalinar against approaching the man, who seemed insane, and when dalinar was determined to go through with it, sigzil and the others who were of the third ideal summoned their blades to better protect him. ishar, convinced that dalinar was odium's champion come to fight him, summoned his honorblade and attacked dalinar; sigzil deflected his attack and fought against ishar with the other four, but they were no match for the herald. ishar used his abilities to connect the windrunners one by one to the ground and drain their stormlight into it, effectively disabling them. after szeth used nightblood to collapse the perpendicularity dalinar had opened, the windrunners' connections to the ground had also vanished. when sigzil drew in stormlight again, though, he found that it didn't do much to dull the pain and tiredness. shortly after, ishar fled through another perpendicularity into shadesmar. sigzil and the others waited in the sky above the camp, then descended again when it seemed obvious that ishar was not immediately coming back. they poked through the herald's tent among several odd corpses covered in sheets, and sigzil found a ledger detailing his experiments: records recounting how long each spren had lived in the body the herald had created for it in the physical realm. appalled, the group fled back to their camp in emul. dawnshard and the night brigade[edit] at an unknown point, hoid offered sigzil a dawnshard for the sake of protecting the cosmere, which he accepted. this put him on the radar of the night brigade, who began to hunt him down across the cosmere. eventually, he gave the dawnshard to somebody else, hoping that it would get the night brigade off his trail, but they continued to hunt him regardless. this is because his lingering connection to the dawnshard could lead them to it by making a hemalurgic spike out of him. thus he was forced to continue running from them for decades. during this time, he had visited numerous planets, including ashyn and threnody. at some point, he came to an unnamed cavern planet on his run from the night brigade. during his stay, he stole a set of ragged clothes before skipping away. overthrowing the cinder king[edit] after his visit to the cavern world, he appeared on a planet known as canticle, dangerously low on investiture and not knowing where he was.[citation needed][expand] relationships[edit] auxiliary[edit] he and auxiliary have a very complex and ambivalent relationship that mixes amicability and judgement.[citation needed][expand] auxiliary is his second spren, bonded after he broke his oaths with his first spren.[citation needed][expand] auxiliary ultimately gives his life to give sigzil a last burst of power in order to help him protect his own life and that of the beaconites, burning away his own essence. kaladin[edit] at first, sigzil despises what kaladin tries to do to help bridge four, but he slowly warms up to his efforts. eventually sigzil looks up to kaladin and is glad to help him with the administrative side of training the bridgemen and later the windrunners, though he wishes his relationship with kaladin were more clear cut. kaladin helps sigzil see that failing the exams in azir isn't such a bad thing, as he is now with a group of people who really appreciate him; sigzil realizes that he is glad he found his way to bridge four. kaladin listens when sigzil speaks, finding himself remembering later things that sigzil had told him about different parts of the world. he feels confident enough in sigzil to name him one of the first lieutenants and later to transfer command of the windrunners to him after his retirement. odium exploits kaladin's care for sigzil by showing him visions of sigzil fighting other members of bridge four and telling him with his dying breaths that he should have let the rest of them just die on the shattered plains. hoid[edit] sigzil has a very strained relationship with hoid. hating it for abandoning him when he became a slave at the shattered plains, doing nothing to help despite knowing how much he was suffering. for a long period during his slavery, he believed that hoid thought him dead.[citation needed] despite his hatred of hoid, he still agreed to take on the dawnshard for him for the good of the cosmere.[citation needed] he also finds some degree of guidance in his teachings. before his enslavement, they have a rather amicable relationship, traveling the world and learning about different cultures.[citation needed] hoid often had to help get him out of trouble, like when he was arrested thrice in babatharnam. hoid himself feels shame at how he treated sigzil, knowing that his lack of action was wrong. trivia[edit] - despite being hoid's apprentice, sigzil had not been off roshar as of the true desolation. - zellion was first revealed as the final stretch goal for the stormlight premium miniatures kickstarter run by brotherwise games. - while zellion is shown wielding a white - in the kickstarter image, this is just a placeholder commonly used in - concept art. - johnny o'neal, the president of brotherwise games, had indicated that zellion would be a new character and not an alias of an existing character. - this was a misunderstanding on his own part, and what brandon meant was it was a new addition to the minifigure collection, and not necessarily a new character in of itself. - zellion shares his name with the protagonist of - , brandon's unpublished fifth novel. in that book, zellion is a soldier made immortal through advanced technology which is also slowly driving him insane. - brandon has confirmed the origin of the name and stated that zellion will ""kind of"" be related to the previous version of the character, but reimagined for the cosmere. - brandon also used the name zellion for his character in a playthrough of the video game - . notes[edit]"
Hnanan,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Hnanan,"""“you have killed a king. would you do the same to a god? ”-hnanan to moash"" hnanan is a shanay-im fused on roshar. she gives moash the knife he uses to kill jezrien. appearance and abilities[edit] hnanan's name is less a word and more of a humming sound. she is referred to as ancient singer. hnanan wears robes with a long train and speaks alethi with a strong accent. as one of the heavenly ones, hnanan has access to the surge of gravitation the ability to make use of voidlight, as well as the ability to be reborn in the bodies of other singers. due to this ability, hnanan rarely sets foot on the ground, preferring to hover like other fused with the same ability. history[edit] millenia ago, hnanan was made into one of the fused by odium, granted powers and the ability to be reincarnated in another singer's body. she fought in the desolations against humankind, returning to braize with the other fused at the end of each desolation. hnanan served as one of the leaders of the fused, ranked similarly to a highprince. she may have two siblings, a brother and a sister. if so, it is possible that leshwi is the sister. as of the true desolation, in 1174, hnanan was reincarnated and took up residence in the king's chambers of kholinar palace after the city fell to the voidbringers. odium spoke to hnanan, instructing her to command moash to kill jezrien. hnanan sent leshwi to bring him to her rooms. she met him on the balcony, hovering over the edge looking at the city. she gave moash a yellow-white knife and sent him to murder jezrien in the beggars' porch. notes[edit]"
Desolation,https://coppermind.net/wiki/First_Desolation,"""“they were destruction made manifest, brightlord. each one was so profoundly devastating that humankind was left broken. populations ruined, society crippled, scholars dead. humankind was forced to spend generations rebuilding after each one. ”-kalami describing a desolation"" the desolations are cataclysmic events on roshar involving the heralds and the voidbringers. they were massive, continent-wide wars. after each desolation, human civilization lay in ruins. participants[edit] heralds[edit] the heralds were the leaders of honor's forces during the desolations. they were responsible for teaching mankind skills to help them prepare for the coming conflict. for example, jezrien taught leadership, vedel trained surgeons, and kalak taught how to cast bronze. they were also each the patron of a radiant order and helped to guide and lead the knights. they were involved in combat, with taln in particular becoming known for his choice of impossible battles that he won. in between desolations, the heralds were the ones on braize holding back the fused. they had made the oathpact with honor which gave them the honorblades and the ability to hold back the fused. however, a loophole in the oathpact allowed them to bend and temporarily allow the fused to roshar, leading them to getting captured and tortured on braize. knights radiant[edit] ""“they were a solution, a way to offset the destruction of the desolations. ten orders of knights, founded with the purpose of helping men fight, then rebuild.”-dalinar's visions"" the knights radiant were originally a surprise to honor, as he had not shown it to the heralds. spren decided to mimic the heralds and give men access to surgebinding by forming nahel bonds. while the knights radiant as a whole helped in fighting the voidbringers and rebuilding society, each order of knights fulfilled a different role. the windrunners acted as scouts, the stonewards acted as front line soldiers, and the lightweavers gave spiritual sustenance to the troops. many of the radiants, particularly the windrunners, lived in cities in alethela and crossed borders into other nations to fight. the shardblades and shardplate that radiants could wield gave them a better chance when fighting the voidbringers, particularly the thunderclasts. the radiants invited any with the desire and ability to fight or lead to come get training and potentially join them. voidbringers[edit] voidbringers is the collective term that refers to all the forces allied with the shard odium during a desolation. beings that count as voidbringers include the fused, regals, singers, voidspren, unmade, and thunderclasts. the voidbringers follow a strict hierarchy. the fused are at the top, far above the regals. the regals, who have bonded voidspren and attained forms of power, are above common singers. where sapient voidspren and unmade fall in this hierarchy is currently unknown, though ba-ado-mishram in particular has been described as a commander of odium's forces, so she is likely near the top of the hierarchy. some humans chose to fight for the voidbringers as well. history[edit] the first desolation[edit] the first desolation occurred when mankind invaded roshar. humans had destroyed their previous home with surgebinding and came to roshar seeking shelter. the singers granted them the land that would later become shinovar. dissatisfied with what they had been given, the humans decided to invade the rest of the continent. this was the first military conflict between humans and singers. a singer who witnessed the invasion wrote the eila stele as a warning against trusting humans. the oathpact[edit] some of the singers that were killed by the invading humans were infused with power by odium before they passed beyond. these singers became the fused, cognitive shadows that possess living singers and could not be killed. ishar founded the oathpact as a solution. he and the other nine people that would become heralds made a pact with honor to seal the fused on braize. taln was not originally meant to join the heralds, but somehow became part of the group. the heralds thought the oathpact would end the endless war, but because they are human, there was a loophole. the heralds had the ability to bend their oath and let the fused return to roshar, starting a desolation. knowing this loophole, the fused captured and tortured the heralds. historical desolations[edit] the coming of a desolation was announced by the appearance of the ten heralds. the appearance of midnight essence was also a sign of an upcoming desolation. a desolation began when the fused returned to roshar, known as the return. each return, fused needed to find singers willing to give the fused their bodies. one of the desolations lasted eleven years. there were not many more than fifteen desolations total. a desolation ended with the heralds leaving roshar and returning to braize. the heralds had a fixed period of time they could remain on roshar. if they exceeded it, a new desolation would start. between desolations[edit] ""“in the aftermath of each one, mankind was broken. great cities in ashes, industry smashed. each time, knowledge and growth were reduced to an almost prehistoric state. ”-jasnah"" humankind was devastated in the aftermath of each desolation. casualties were generally severe; in one desolation, ninety percent of the population of nohadon's kingdom died. this mass death lead to the fall of many nations, with some-such as sur, eiliz, and tarma-wiped out so thoroughly that they disappeared from history altogether. this level of cataclysmic event pushed men to a technology level equivalent to that of the stone age. although society would sometimes progress beyond that before the next desolation began, the heralds would often be forced to push technology forward thousands of years in the single year after their return. it was the duty of the knights radiant to stay vigilant and prepare themselves and mankind for desolations, and to fight the voidbringers when they arrive. between desolations, the heralds returned to braize. at first, the ten men and women hid from and fought the fused. inevitably, they would be caught and tortured. by the nature of their bond, the heralds were able share their pain and withstand the torture together until someone broke. early on, the heralds were able to withstand torture for hundreds of years between desolations. the torture slowly broke the heralds, however, and the gaps were decreasing to less than ten years near the end. the last gap was less than a year long, with the heralds breaking as soon as the fused caught and began the torture. the only herald to never break was taln. the torture the heralds endured between desolations included hooks digging into their skin, their skin getting seared off, and their fat burning. the torture began over again every day. the last desolation[edit] at the end of what is called the last desolation, nine of ten heralds managed to survive the fighting, which was an unusual occurrence. fearful of the torture they would face on their return to braize, the heralds chose to break the oathpact rather than return. although they had been warned that lingering on roshar would lead to another desolation, ishar told the others that taln alone would be enough to maintain the oathpact. whether or not this was true mattered little to the heralds as they only wished to avoid torture. the heralds left their honorblades in a circle and all walked in a different direction, telling people that humanity had finally won the war for good. ishar's prediction turned out to be true, and taln held back the fused for 4500 years while mankind believed there would be no more desolations. the false desolation[edit] ""“something must be done about the remnants of odium’s forces. the parsh, as they are now called, continue their war with zeal, even without their masters from damnation.”-drawer 30-20, first emerald"" unlike previous desolations, the false desolation did not involve the heralds or fused. the false desolation began when ba-ado-mishram learned how to connect with the majority of the singers, giving them forms of power and access to voidlight. the radiants, unaware of how she did this, sought a way to end the fighting for good, as the heralds had promised them. the fighting became particularly intense at this time, as the singers made a push towards feverstone keep, possibly as part of a plan to capture rall elorim. working together, the scholars among the radiants theorized that an unmade could be imprisoned like a regular spren. that devised a plan to trap ba-ado-mishram and prevent her from connecting with the singers and providing them with voidlight. this plan would require melishi, the only bondsmith of his generation, and a special prison, likely a perfect gemstone. although melishi was confident the plan would succeed in destroying the voidbringers, naze-daughter-kuzodo warned of unintended side effects. although the plan seems to have succeeded, as ba-ado-mishram has not been seen in modern times unlike other unmade, naze-daughter-kuzodo's warning was correct. because she had been connected to all the singers, their connection and identity was torn out of them, creating slaveform or parshmen. the radiants' horror for what happened likely contributed to the recreance. the true desolation[edit] the true desolation began approximately two thousand years after the false desolation, when talenel appears at the gates of kholinar, after returning to roshar from braize. not all that long after, at the battle of narak, stormform listeners summon the everstorm, which appears to begin the true desolation. warfare[edit] fabrials[edit] ""“all this time we’ve been assuming that we lost great technology in the desolations, but it seems we are far, far more advanced than the ancients ever were. ”-jasnah about fabrials"" during the ancient desolations, mankind did not have access to the modern fabrials and fabrial knowledge that is currently known on roshar. the only fabrials they had access to were ancient fabrials. these fabrials seem to work through a mutual agreement with a sentient spren rather than trapping a spren in a gemstone. the vast majority of fabrials seem to replicate surges and were used in a support position rather than actual combat. the oathgates utilizes the surge of transportation to allow instantaneous travel across the continent. healing fabrials use the surge of progression to heal wounds and seem to have been carried often by radiants on patrol. although it is not courrently known how these fabrials were created, aimia could have been involved as that is where soulcasting fabrials originated. it is also possible that urithiru is a giant fabrial powered by the sibling. technology[edit] ""“the desolations were so terrible they destroyed learning and progress and left behind a broken people. ”-jasnah to dalinar"" humanity was stuck at an extremely low level of technology during the desolations. most soldiers fought with bronze and leather armor. because of the destruction, humanity often still had stone tools and weapons when the heralds returned. the heralds would attempt to push humanity forward several thousand years worth of technology in the year before the desolation, which often included learning to cast bronze. even when humanity had learned to cast bronze already, the heralds tried to advance technology further. other areas they attempted to push technology forward include medicine, where vedel would teach techniques such as keeping wounds clean. culture[edit] ""“the desolations had happened during the near-mythical shadowdays, before real history began. before mankind had defeated the voidbringers and taken the war to heaven. ”-dalinar's thoughts"" according to vorinism, mankind fought the voidbringers during desolations ninety and nine times, before mankind finally won and drove them back to the tranquiline halls. that victory was later referred to as the last desolation.

Eila Stele,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Eila_Stele,"the eila stele is the oldest known text on roshar, written in dawnchant. it contains several key pieces of information about the planet's history. history[edit] the eila stele is believed by historians to be the oldest extant document on roshar. it is in the form of a carving, presumably on a stone stele. it was first thought to predate the first desolations, and possibly be written by the heralds. dawnchant became a dead language over time, and the meaning of the eila stele was lost. however, navani kholin realized that fragments of the dawnchant could be recovered from dalinar's visions. this resulted in a spate of translation breakthroughs by navani and ardents at the palanaeum and the jokasha monastery. jasnah and the veristitalians also took an interest, as did taravangian and the diagram. through the efforts of these groups, the dawnchant was eventually cracked, allowing the eila stele to be translated. contents and revelations[edit] after the eila stele was translated, it was revealed that the author was not a herald but a dawnsinger. dawnsingers were ancient ancestors of the singers native to roshar; they were not spren, as theorized by the vorin church. the text further revealed that the first people known as voidbringers were actually humans, who were not native to roshar. this contradicted vorin doctrine regarding the expulsion, which held that mankind fought against the voidbringers to reclaim the tranquiline halls. the eila stele indicated that humans destroyed their own world. most of the humans fled to roshar and were taken in out of pity by the dawnsingers and their gods. the humans were given land known as current-day shinovar, explaining that region's unique flora and fauna. they later used their surgebinding powers to conquer most of roshar. cosmere significance[edit] the eila stele was the key to the refounded knights radiant learning of the abandonment of the planet ashyn. ashyn neighbors roshar in its solar system, and it was almost destroyed through mankind's use of the dawnshards and surgebinding. the heralds were among the humans who abandoned ashyn. the stormfather tells dalinar that during the false desolation, the original knights radiant learned of ashyn's fate, leading them to question the use of surgebinding powers. they were urged on by honor, but after aharietiam, honor was dying and no longer cogent, which led to the events of the day of recreance. the information in the stele directly refutes several aspects of vorin doctrine regarding the history of humanity. further interaction with the heralds and fused have led both humans and singers to gain a better understanding of the rosharan system and the relationship between roshar, ashyn, and braize. some rosharans have had to reexamine their belief system in light of this information, as vorin concepts such as the the expulsion, voidbringers, damnation, and the tranquiline halls have proven to be incorrect or only loosely based in fact. known text[edit] ""“they came from another world, using powers that we have been forbidden to touch. dangerous powers, of spren and surges. they destroyed their lands and have come to us begging. we took them in, as commanded by the gods. what else could we do? they were a people forlorn, without a home. our pity destroyed us. for their betrayal extended even to our gods: to spren, stone, and wind. beware the otherworlders. the traitors. those with tongues of sweetness, but with minds that lust for blood. do not take them in. do not give them succor. well were they named voidbringers, for they brought the void. the empty pit that sucks in emotion. a new god. their god. these voidbringers know no songs. they cannot hear roshar, and where they go, they bring silence. they look soft, with no shell, but they are hard. they have but one heart, and it cannot ever live. ”-eila stele"" notes[edit]"

Rall Elorim,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rall_Elorim,"rall elorim is a city in the mountains of northern iri on roshar and the most populous city in the nation. it is also known as the city of shadows for cryptic reasons, and it contains an oathgate. geography[edit] the city is located in the extreme northwest of roshar. it is situated at the north end of a small mountain range, on a peninsula between the reshi sea and the northern depths. feverstone keep is thought to be near rall elorim. perhaps due to the city's remote location, people from other parts of roshar such as gawx and kaladin have heard tales that characterize it as an exotic, mysterious land. history[edit] during the false desolation the singers, under ba-ado-mishram, may have been interested in controlling something in or near rall elorim. lift grew up in rall elorim, and recalled terrible memories of her time there. rall elorim fell under the control of odium's forces, along with the rest of iri, during the true desolation. this concerned dalinar since the city's oathgate had a great deal of strategic value. notes[edit]"

Midnight Essence,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Midnight_Essence,"midnight essence is a substance that appears throughout the cosmere, most notably connected to midnight aether and re-shephir. midnight essence has not been shown to exist without some degree of sentience or possession through a luhel bond, and therefore can be considered both a substance and a creature. however, whether or not it is truly sentient is questioned. it is associated with re-shephir, as the substance she uses to make her creatures. the ancient radiants considered them one of the ten deaths. dalinar kholin experienced them in one of his visions, while shallan davar, adolin kholin, and members of bridge four had to deal with them while fighting re-shephir in urithiru. on lumar, midnight essence is used by a variety of characters, and is more widely available, with the commonly accessible method of synthesis involving placing water onto midnight spores. nature[edit] midnight essence is a black, viscous, bubbling liquid that imitates a nearby creature. it normally involves some level of corruption to investiture. all midnight essence created exhibits some form of mind, and midnight essence may be an example of concentrated investiture granting sentience. however, even hoid cannot determine whether midnight essence is truly alive. midnight essence can be controlled through a luhel bond, giving the bonder the ability to manipulate the essence's movement and actions, and, if enough control is exerted, dissipate it at will. the luhel bond involves a form of trade with the sentient midnight essence, relinquishing something it wants (water in the case of lumarian essence) in exchange for control over the entity. the summoned essence responds to the bonder's intention and thus can be controlled or bonded without visible or audible communication. appearance & behavior[edit] midnight essence is smooth, slick, black, and reflective. due to its ability of mimicry, it can appear in a variety of shapes, and generally imitates what it sees around it, oft shaped through the lens of the mind they are bound to. the midnight essence creatures created by re-shephir in urithiru were humanoid, mimicking the appearance of people in the tower. however, they can also change shape at will, being able to squeeze themselves into a hole and wriggle away to escape pursuit. some midnight essence creatures on lumar exhibit these same characteristics, with tress's midnight essence mimicking a nearby rat, and sliding underneath a gap between a door and the ship deck with ease, despite being far larger than said gap. some midnight essence creatures, however, appear in shapes unrelated to mimicry. in dalinar's vision, they had six extremely thin legs that were bent at the sides with clawed paws. their bodies seem almost fluid, with long and flexible necks and sharp teeth that appeared like knives. they also give off a putrid smell. additionally, the midnight essence creatures found in the midnight sea look like large sea serpents, though it is unclear whether this is a result of them mimicking some form of deep ocean life, or if they are manipulated to appear this way, similar to the creatures from dalinar's vision. the midnight essence in dalinar's vision had no eyes. it hunted by smell, and made a soft wheezing whispering sound when hunting for a scent. its body was soft, and gave a little when it was struck. when the skin was pierced, the midnight essence bled smoke. if the essence was damaged enough, its entire body would deflate with a hissing sound, leaving behind a skin that looked like a sack of black silk. the midnight essence's mouth was a weak point on its body. midnight essence can be fairly clever as well, wary when facing a skilled or determined opponent. however, this may be a result of manipulation through the wielder of the luhel bond. midnight essence in all forms seems to have some form of rudimentary intelligence, able to impose basic notions onto the minds of those they bond with. they are also capable of following commands given to them, without having to be actively controlled by the user. but it is unclear if it is ever truly self-aware beyond its voracious thirst. abilities[edit] the claws of the midnight essence in dalinar's vision were powerful enough to seriously damage shardplate. it was quite strong, able to burst right through the wall of a barn. as it hunted by smell, it could track people in the darkest night. they also often hunted as a pack. the essence was seemingly impervious to fire. they were also swift, both while running and while fighting. while the midnight essence may be released directly by re-shephir, it also may be extracted from her to be used independently and released elsewhere. it is possible for a user of the midnight aether to become too absorbed into their creation, therefore losing control of their body and seeing through the eyes of their creation, and controlling it as their own body. this appears to have some degree of psychological effects upon the user, making their thoughts and behavior come more in line with what the creation is imitating. this can be dangerous as, when possessing the essence, one loses awareness of the state of their actual body, therefore they can easily die from dehydration. notes[edit]"

Vedel,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Vedel,"vedel, also known as vedeledev in vorinism, is one of the ten heralds of the almighty on roshar, and the patron herald of the order of edgedancers. like the other heralds, vedel protected mankind during the cycle of desolations before abandoning them at aharietiam. appearance and history[edit] vedel would appear as alethi to modern rosharans. she was born on ashyn and made the trip to roshar during the expulsion. she was someone important in the pre-desolations society -- a queen, scholar, or general. along with the others, she approached honor and formed the oathpact. whenever a desolation ended, she'd travel along with them to braize, where she suffered torture until one of them broke. she broke at least once, starting a new desolation. while on roshar, she would train surgeons in anticipation of the incoming desolation. once the knights radiant formed, she admitted patronage of the order of edgedancers. at the time of the last desolation, vedel decided with the other heralds to give up the oathpact and leave taln alone on braize. it is not known where she went or what she's been doing during the era of solitude. attributes and abilities[edit] vedel is a herald, making her a cognitive shadow and thus immortal. when she dies, she returns to braize to be tortured. until aharietiam, she wielded a honorblade, which gave her access to the surges of abrasion and progression, and she was a capable swordswoman. she might've been a doctor before she became a herald, as she has vast medical knowledge, and trained new surgeons before a desolation. it's likely that a lot of the heralds' teachings regarding medicine -- such as the mandate to always wash hands before an operation -- came from her. culture[edit] like all the heralds, vedel's name has become part of culture. in vorinism, she is called vedeledev, and swearing by vedeledev's golden keys is used to express astonishment. ""vedeledev knows"" is also used. the name is sometimes shortened to vev -- this is used both as an expression of its own, and as the vorin number 4. names vedelliar and vevidar are probably derived from vedel. within the context of the ten essences, vedel is traditionally associated with the loving and healing divine attributes, the gemstone diamond, and the essence of lucentia. the golden keys that people swear by and that are present in some artwork of her are derived from a rosharan myth; though they have really existed, they are more symbolic than actually imbued with any power. what the myth is about is undetermined. trivia[edit] - three of the - epigraphs in - are from the month of vev, one in 1172 - and two in 1173. - vedel is featured as one of the - endpapers. - brandon has compared the golden keys to the biblical flaming sword that's said to protect the passage to the tree of life in the garden of eden. - it's uncertain whether the two serve similar purpose, or if they're both simply mythological artifacts. - vedel's portrait used in the chapter arches is called the healer by the - staff. notes[edit]"
Vyre's knife,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Vyre%27s_knife,"vyre's knife is a bright golden raysium blade with a sapphire set into the pommel, used to kill the herald jezrien and trap his soul so that he couldn't be reborn. history[edit] the circumstances of the knife's creation are unknown. it was given by the fused hnanan to moash (later known as vyre). hnanan told moash that odium had tasked him with killing a god; moash noted that the fused appeared to be afraid of using the knife on jezrien themselves. moash then used the knife to kill jezrien. after the murder, moash removed the knife from jezrien's body, but the subsequent fate of the knife is unknown. mechanics[edit] the knife can kill a herald by trapping the soul, preventing the herald from returning to braize as a ""conventional"" herald death would. jezrien, while initially in a drunken stupor, quickly realizes that something about this death is different and claims to feel the knife drawing something from him into itself. shalash and kalak likewise instantly distinguishes it from previous deaths, as they could no longer sense jezrien's soul. the knife ""traps"" the soul so it can't be reborn. it functions by absorbing all of the investiture that makes up the cognitive shadow of a herald, running it down the length of the blade and into the gemstone set into the pommel. [citation needed] this process operates under similar principles to the scadrian manifestation of investiture known as hemalurgy, where practitioners are able to steal part of an individual's spiritweb using metal spikes. it would cause debate among cosmere philosophers whether the knife's magical properties are in fact hemalurgy or rather a related, but distinct, phenomenon. following jezrien's death, the sapphire set into the knife takes on a ""subdued glow"". the sapphire in the knife's hilt is specifically for jezrien. whether the use of that specific polestone is mechanically relevant or only symbolic is unknown. the knife shares characteristics with nightblood, as they both bleed black smoke and leave blackened wounds. notes[edit]"

Bridge crew,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Bridgeman,"the bridge crews, crewed by men known as the bridgemen, were originally an expendable workforce used for hard labor and cannon fodder. they later become an infantry battalion, but retain the name ""bridge crews"" as their official unit name. under highprince torol sadeas, the bridge crews carry large, heavy bridges in order to allow his soldiers to cross the chasms of the shattered plains. the bridgemen consist mainly of slaves, deserters, thieves, foreigners, and some men who joined because they had nowhere else to go. the bridgemen were treated as expendable and incurred heavy casualties with every bridge run. the bridge crews are later transferred to the control of highprince dalinar kholin, where they become a battalion of soldiers in kholin's army. in this capacity, they are commanded by captain kaladin stormblessed, with bridge four as its premier unit and headquarters. under highprince sadeas[edit] origins[edit] the unique geography of the shattered plains required the armies to cross many chasms to reach the battlefields. highprince torol sadeas employed a large number of bridgemen to transport his army's temporary bridges. the bridgemen were also used as cannon fodder for the parshendi bowmen. the bridgemen were split into 40 bridge crews, each carrying one bridge. each bridge crew was comprised of approximately 35-40 men. the most notable crew was bridge four: initially known for being the worst crew with the highest casualty rate, they are later noted for their excellence and innovation to bridge warfare while under the command of kaladin. organization[edit] gaz was the bridge sergeant, reporting directly to brightlord lamaril. after lamaril is executed, brightlord matal takes nominal command of the unit, although his wife brightness hashal is the one who is actually commanding the unit. within each bridge crew, the men appointed their own bridge leader, but they lacked an overall command structure or allegiance to anything except their own self-preservation. functions[edit] during hunts for gemhearts, bridgemen will carry the bridge and place it to the next plateau. while the army is crossing the bridge, they have time to rest, but they will need to run and get ahead of the army once everyone passed. during such runs, positions in the front is preferred because of fresh air and better sight. bridgemen will take turns for positions in a fair manner. however, if the next plateau is occupied by parshendi forces, bridge crews will face heavy fire and almost always suffer heavy casualties because they act as easy targets to attract fire away from the main forces. positions at the rear, which are better shielded against arrows, are preferred in this case, although the survival rate is very poor for every position. people who refuse to follow the rules will be forced to run in the front; the position at the center is referred to as the ""deathpoint"" due to its high mortality rate. new recruits are often stationed at the deathpoint since they are considered expendable. bridgeleaders have some power over the position arrangements and typically take the best positions for themselves. in normal times, the bridge crews act as man power and do various unwanted duties in the war camp. among them is the chasm duty, which requires people to scavenge for weapons, armor or spheres from the chasms. under highprince kholin[edit] after kaladin saves highprince dalinar kholin's life, highprince kholin repays him by securing the release of the entire bridge crew unit from highprince sadeas. he does this by giving his shardblade, oathbringer, to highprince sadeas in exchange for the bridge crews' freedom. following this, highprince kholin offers money and freedom to every member of the bridge crews, along with the opportunity to join kholin's army as soldiers. very few bridgemen take kholin's offer to leave, and kholin is left with a full thousand-man battalion. after the bridge crews are freed by kholin, they all immediately recognize kaladin as their leader. highprince kholin formalizes this by appointing kaladin as their commander with the rank of captain. organization[edit] captain kaladin re-organizes the bridge crews into twenty platoons of fifty men each, with each platoon named from bridge one to bridge twenty, in memory of their previous life. bridge four, kaladin's original bridge crew, becomes their premier unit as well as headquarters platoon. initially, forty members (two from each bridge) are chosen to be trained directly by members of bridge four. these forty members are then seeded back to their original bridges, promoted, and help train the remainder of their bridges, with assistance from bridge four. innovations[edit] under captain kaladin's command, the bridge crews have implemented a number of innovations to warfare. due to kaladin's background in medicine, he has trained some members of the bridge crews in battlefield medicine, leading to the first deployment of combat medics on the battlefield. kaladin also creates a modernized command structure for the bridge crews. a typical alethi army is organized around a very small number of lighteyed officers with a moderate amount of ""citizen officers,"" the alethi term for a non-commissioned officer. since the bridge crews have no lighteyes, and also because kaladin believes this command structure to be lacking, he creates the position of lieutenant between himself and the sergeants who lead platoons. additionally, he is considering expanding the size of his non-commissioned officer corps by adding the additional rank of ""master sergeant."" bridges[edit] notes[edit]"
Worldsingers,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Worldsinger,"""“i am not a foolish jester or storyteller. i do not 'give tales.' i spread knowledge of cultures, peoples, thoughts, and dreams. i bring peace through understanding. it is the holy charge my order received from the heralds themselves. ”-sigzil on the worldsingers"" the worldsingers are an organization of storytellers and knowledge-givers on roshar. they were founded by hoid, and were active during the era of solitude and the true desolation. mission[edit] worldsingers travel the world learning of other places and cultures and sharing information about the places they have already been. when they visit a new place, they tend to ask many questions and seek precise answers. their knowledge of kingdoms and cultures is extensive, and can include various topics such as history, religion, geography, architecture, trade, local traditions, and demographics. they see themselves as superior to traditional storytellers, charged by the heralds to spread knowledge. some worldsingers do use stories to put people at ease; they may use allegories to help pass on information. hoid, who is the creator and a member of the worldsingers, used a trailman's flute when he told stories but it is unclear if the flute is related to his worldsinger status or one of his many other abilities. history[edit] in 1170, shallan davar thought that there might be a worldsinger at the middlefest fair sponsored by her family. she knew what worldsingers were like and seemed to find their presence relatively commonplace, implying that the group had been active in jah keved for some time. at some point prior to 1173, sigzil failed to pass the azish exams to become a public servant; he subsequently started getting into trouble and was rescued by hoid, who took him on as an apprentice. sigzil traveled with hoid, including a trip to babatharnam. hoid expressed some frustration with sigzil as an apprentice, noting that he was sometimes judgmental or foolish, and he had to rescue him on multiple occasions. at some point, the pair became separated. sigzil attempted to kill someone for unknown reasons and became a member of a bridge crew. sigzil did not tell anyone on the shattered plains that he was a worldsinger. however, lunamor was able to identify sigzil as a member of the order without any apparent prior knowledge of his history. it is unclear if this is related to lunamor's rare ability as a sighted. once the secret was out, sigzil began telling the other bridgemen about distant places such as sesemalex dar. during sigzil's stint in the bridge crews, hoid had some reason to believe that he was dead. sigzil did not contact hoid to let him know that he was still alive, possibly because he did not want to be rescued again. once hoid learned that sigzil was alive, he promoted him from an apprentice to a full worldsinger. after sigzil was freed and became a knight radiant, he continued to serve as a worldsinger and hoped to improve his storytelling skills. notable worldsingers[edit] - : master worldsinger - : a full worldsinger, former apprentice to hoid trivia[edit] - there is a connection between worldsingers, the - - , and possibly other groups in the - . - the similarity in their names is not a coincidence. - given hoid's - abilities, fans have speculated that he is the connection, - but - has not confirmed this. - brandon would consider himself akin to a worldsinger. notes[edit]"
Akanny,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Akanny,"akanny is a region of sadeas princedom valued highly for its farmlands. they grew lavis and tallew, and kaladin reckoned that the yield fed most of alethkar. some villages bred hogs for leather and meat, or gumfrems for their gemhearts which could be used to soulcast meat. kaladin passed over the region while searching for the voidbringer army after leaving hearthstone. notes[edit]"
Honu,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Honu,"honu is a type of lavis grain liquor on roshar. in late 1173, during the weeping at the shattered plains, zahel drank from a bottle of hard honu while he talked to kaladin about washing the sand in the lighteyed dueling grounds. the existence of ""hard"" honu implies that there may be several different types of honu with a variety of alcoholic strengths. lavis grows throughout roshar and can also be used to make beer. notes[edit]"
Kuma,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kuma,"kuma is a foodstuff on roshar in the era of solitude. it is made of crushed lavis and spices, and is sometimes served in flatbread. after the battle of thaylen field, bridge four ate a meal of flatbread with kuma. notes[edit]"
Flangria,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Flangria,"flangria is a type of meat found on roshar. flangria is produced via soulcasting, which makes it far cheaper than other kinds of meat, although some disdain flangria due to its origin. it is often used to cheaply feed large quantities of people, such as bridgemen. it is fried and used in the meatballs for chouta, an inexpensive herdazian food. notes[edit]"
Chouta,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Chouta,"chouta is a street food that is originally from herdaz on roshar but has also gained popularity off-world, at least on scadrial. it consists of fried flatbread wrapped tightly around fried meat and sauce, and can be carried in one hand and eaten while doing other things. ingredients[edit] the flatbread used in chouta is very thick. the meat often used in the warcamps is flangria, which is mixed with ground lavis, formed into small balls, battered and fried. the meatballs are then stuffed into the fried bread and covered with a generous amount of dark gravy. the chouta stands in dalinar's warcamp also sell a variety that is stuffed with fried cremling claws instead of meatballs, and there may be other variations. chouta is flavorful, but not spicy. history[edit] lopen introduced bridge four to chouta in the warcamps. kaladin initially thought it looked disgusting, but sigzil and rock tried it and enjoyed it. kaladin eventually broke down and bought some chouta from a street vendor; he was annoyed to discover that he actually liked it. the love of chouta spread throughout bridge four, and teft, skar, leyten, and drehy were all later seen eating it. chouta was sold at a tavern in kholinar visited by hoid and shallan. it was also commonly eaten in urithiru. by 348 pc, chouta was readily available in northern scadrial; wayne got some very greasy chouta at a food stand in bilming while he, wax, and marasi were investigating maraga. wax thought it looked disgusting, but wayne argued that that was how street food should look. trivia[edit] - has noted that chouta are not inspired by burritos and are closer to ""deep-fried meatballs in a - "". - brandon is fascinated by the rapid development of portable street food during the industrial revolution, and devised chouta to reflect this concept. notes[edit]"
Clema,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Clema,"clema is a crop grown on roshar. it is labor-intensive to grow, similar to tallew or lavis, and cannot easily survive flooding. clemabread[edit] clema can be baked into large rolls known as clemabread. clemabread is common in tashikk, and it is likely made in other parts of roshar; lift appears to be familiar with it when she arrives in yeddaw. the bread is granular and breaks apart easily, giving it a mushy texture when eaten. the rolls often have a spicy paste at the center and can be served warm. clemabread is presumably cheap to make, as the stump often serves it at tashi's light orphanage. according to lift, this clemabread is ""only slightly better than gruel, which is only slightly better than cold socks."" notes[edit]"
Tallew,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tallew,"tallew is a type of grain native to roshar. cultivation[edit] tallew is a relatively labor-intensive crop to grow, as it cannot survive flooding from highstorms. this makes it profitable to sell, which led turinad sebarial to set up tallew fields near the warcamps on the shattered plains. the akanny region of the sadeas princedom in alethkar has rolling hills that are ideal for growing lavis and tallew, and it produces a large amount of both grains. once harvested, tallew can be stored for months to provide sustenance during the winter. it can be transported in bags and used as rations on long journeys. tallew's long shelf life allowed the kholinar wall guard to eat it during the siege of kholinar. culinary uses[edit] tallew is similar to rice and it can be prepared in several ways, including steaming and boiling. it is a simple meal often eaten by soldiers, slaves, and ardents. the grain often has other ingredients such as spices added to it. lighteyes sometimes eat boiled tallew mixed with a spicy gravy spread on slices of stagm. fruited tallew rice with flatbread is a common meal for children in alethkar. tallew is often used as an ingredient in stew. tvlakv served his slaves unspiced, overcooked tallew with a mushy texture and kaladin found it revolting, later experiencing flashbacks to how bad it tasted. tallew can be used to make flatbread. it can also be fermented to make brandy or veden saph. notes[edit]"
Stumpweight,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Stumpweight,"the stumpweight is a species of tree native to roshar. appearance and anatomy[edit] stumpweight trees are typically around six feet tall. they have thick trunks with a knobby, sometimes scraggly appearance. they tend to grow in small clusters. they have long, ""banner-like"" leaves that only grow on the leeward side of the trunk to avoid being damaged by highstorms. like several other rosharan plants, the leaves are retractable and can very rapidly fold up and around the trunk for additional protection. they make an audible whipping sound as they fold. in some locations such as kholinar, stumpweight trees are cultivated to be much taller and leafier than usual in order to provide more shade. ecology[edit] stumpweight trees are quite common in alethkar and are seen growing in the sadeas princedom. it is likely that they also grow in jah keved. they are usually only able to grow in relatively warm areas of roshar. shallan is perplexed to find a stumpweight trunk in the chasms in the middle of the shattered plains because the region is too cold for them to grow natively. uses[edit] wood from the trunks of stumpweight trees is heavy, durable, and dark in color. it is chopped down as timber and used architecturally to make things like doors. it is also commonly used to make furniture such as chairs and desks. it can be polished and used decoratively. the sap from stumpweight trees is important in the cultivation of lavis polyps. it is mixed with lavis seeds and spread across the hills during the seasons following the weeping, when the highstorms are relatively weak. stumpweight sap can also be extracted for use as an emulsifier in mixing oil and water. notes[edit]"
Rockbud,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rockbud,"rockbuds are plants with rock-like shells native to roshar. the term refers to all plants that have shells as well as to the ""true"" or ""common"" rockbud. the shell protects the more sensitive organism within from highstorms. after storms, tendrils reach out of the bud to lap up the water on the ground. rockbuds have also been seen to ingest chasmfiend blood. domestic cultivation[edit] the vines of domestic rockbuds have slower reactions than that of wild buds. the listeners are known to accelerate growth of rockbuds using stormlight from gemstones, though this method eventually breaks the gemstone. colder climates will stunt the growth of rockbuds. in warmer areas buds can grow nearly to the size of a barrel with vines as thick as a human wrist; however, in the frostlands they grow no bigger than a fist and move slowly, as if numbed by the cold. uses[edit] rockbuds provide a variety of uses. they contain watergourds which can be used for medicinal purposes, provide food for both chull and human consumption, and dried rockbud pulp is used in paper making. though they do not burn as well as wood, the shells may be used as fuel for fire as the exterior creates a barrier between the interior and moisture. the inside of certain rockbud shells can also be shredded to create textiles. many archers on roshar, both human and parshendi use certain types of rockbud leaves to fletch their arrows. rockbud family[edit] besides referring to the the true rockbud, also known as the common rockbud, the term ""rockbud"" can signify a variety of other plants on roshar. the following plants are categorized as rockbuds: trivia[edit] - when found upon stone buildings rockbuds must be scraped away as they can eat away the stone in the walls, creating pockmarks and cracks. notes[edit]"
Colot,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Colot,"colot is a captain of the fifth battalion of the kholin army on roshar. he later becomes a windrunner. appearance and personality[edit] he is lighteyed and lanky. he is referred to as a ""good man"" by skar. history[edit] kholin army[edit] colot was an archer in the kholin army in a battalion with a number of archers; he was a captain, also commanding some scouts, scribes, and bridgemen. he was good friends with captain tallan of the eighth company, which acted as the fifth battalion's policing force during the battle of narak. after the battle, he volunteered his battalion to help bridge four scout urithiru. he arrived on the scene with reinforcements just after the death of vedekar perel; dalinar asked him to help secure the perimeter and to notify elhokar and sebarial of the death. radiant squire[edit] colot was among a group of potential knights radiant squires that general khal sent to kaladin. kaladin was hesitant to recruit lighteyes, but skar vouched for colot and pointed out that renarin was also lighteyed. colot and the other lighteyed recruits submitted to orders during the tryout without complaint, causing skar to reflect on kaladin's and teft's prejudiced perception of lighteyes. rlain later saw colot and nine other new recruits to bridge four training with peet after gaining the ability to breathe in stormlight. colot was the only lighteyed squire in the group, and remained one of only a few members of bridge four who were originally lighteyed. after becoming a squire, colot's name was known to shallan. while disguised as a messenger from the shattered plains, she invoked his name to seem more authentic during her attempt to deliver a letter from elhokar to aesudan. notes[edit]"
Narm,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Narm,"narm is a member of bridge four. appearance and personality[edit] he is skinnier than most of the other bridgemen. narm is also one of the loudest complainers about kaladin’s leadership, alongside moash and sigzil. history[edit] during his first run as bridgeleader, kaladin sought to find and heal the wounded bridgemen best he could. he asked narm to make a fire, handing over his own shirt for tinder. narm struggled to get the fire going while kaladin worked on gadol. despite his efforts, gadol died, but kaladin yelled at narm to keep the fire going and not to let it die in case others come. to his surprise, narm actually got a small flame going which they used to treat other bridgemen. when bridge four is assigned chasm duty, narm was working beside moash who was taunting kaladin. kaladin performed a kata which left them all, including moash and narm, stunned. impressed with kaladin, three-quarters of the bridgemen joined kaladin for training in the morning, except for some of the loudest complainers including narm. later, on a bridge run, narm was injured alongside peet. it was a fraction of what other crews lost, but kaladin argued that was still too many. during the bridge run in which kaladin first employed the carapace armor, the parshendi fell into formation, nocking some fifty arrows at kaladin and the rest of bridge four. they are saved by the timely arrival of dalinar kholin and his honor guard. after the close call, kaladin sent narm and leyten to find good scouting points and watch the field for any parshendi movement towards the chasm. narm was one of three bridgemen casualties during the battle of the tower, alongside malop and earless jaks. he died trying to hold the bridge against the parshendi while the kholin army retreated. notes[edit]"
Jal Mala,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Jal_Mala,"jal mala is a veden highprince. jal mala was killed by szeth, either in his attack on king hanavanar's feast or in an independent strike. his death was one of several among the veden highprinces, which ultimately culminated in the veden civil war. notes[edit]"

Boriar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Boriar,"highprince boriar is a highprince of jah keved. history[edit] highprince boriar was one of several highprinces that participated in the veden succession war following the assassination of king hanavanar by the assassin in white. one of boriar's rivals was highprince valam. boriar was likely one of the seven factions that fought for control of vedenar. boriar was defeated and killed, although his manner of death is unknown. the newly crowned king valam, unaware of boriar's death, wondered what boriar and the other highprinces would make of valam making king taravangian as his heir. taravangian informed valam of boriar and the other highprinces' deaths. notes[edit]"
Abrial,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Abrial,"abrial is a highprince of jah keved. in 1173, abrial attended one of king hanavanar's feasts in vedenar. during the feast, szeth attempted to assassinate the king on taravangian's orders. during the fighting, abrial was likely killed along with several other veden highprinces, although reports of his death were at least initially unconfirmed. notes[edit]"
Highprince of Commerce,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Highprince_of_Commerce,"""“life doesn’t stop for a war, child. everyone will still need new shoes, baskets, clothing, wine. ”-sebarial to shallan"" the highprince of commerce is a title bestowed by the alethi king onto one of his highprinces on roshar. it is unclear if the highprince of commerce role existed previously when kingdom duties were split between the different highprinces. it is currently held by highprince sebarial. duties[edit] the highprince of commerce is responsible for securing and regulating trade throughout alethkar. he has the authority to patrol the trade routes and markets, establish new marketplaces, and institute laws governing them. he can set up taxes, both on trade routes and goods, is responsible for keeping track of the country's supplies and economy, and has some measure of control over the use of the crowns gemstones. history[edit] in the time period between gavilar's unification of the country and the true desolation, alethkar did not have a highprince of commerce. dalinar gave the role to sebarial following the alethi relocating to urithiru in an effort to turn the tower into a livable space . sebarial was ordered to establish a new marketplace and despite navani's wishes for an orderly and well regulated thoroughfare, sebarial agreed to the demands of the merchants who wanted the marketplace to be larger so it would be harder to regulate and control. to help appease the merchants, as well as lower tensions, sebarial also subsidized the price of alcohol by lowing taxes on these goods. sebarial also created a lucrative tax plan for movement through the oathgate to create revenue for the tower city and sustain its population. while sebarial has broad authority at urithiru, this does not stretch beyond the city and the shattered plains war camps, as queen fen of thaylenah is made responsible for commerce in the broader alliance. this arrangement is partially to help with diplomatic relations and partially to punish sebarial for his general attitude. notes[edit]"
Highprince of Works,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Highprince_of_Works,"""“ hatham does an excellent job as highprince of works, but there isn’t proper infrastructure... equally important, brightness, we might be facing a severe labor shortage. ”- issues faced by living in urithiru"" the highprince of works is a title bestowed by the alethi king onto one of his highprinces on roshar. it is unclear if the highprince of works role existed previously when kingdom duties were split between the different highprinces. it is currently held by highprince hatham. the highprince of works appears to be responsible for kingdom's public works, such as cleaning and maintaining the infrastructure. in urithiru, he's responsible for the upkeep of public lavatories, providing water to the inhabitants of the tower and packing goods to be distributed throughout the alethi holdings. he has the ability to draft the soldiers, caravan workers, and low-nahn citizens to work, although his power in this regard is limited, as they are not slaves and require compensation for their work. in addition, his men are attempting to grow food on urithiru's balcony-farms, though so far they haven't had much success. in the time period between gavilar's unification of the country and the true desolation, alethkar did not have a highprince of works. in the aftermath of the everstorm's arrival, hatham was given the title and tasked with making urithiru livable for its current population. though he is doing as admirably, the semi-functional state of the tower city makes his task extremely difficult and living in the tower is unsustainable without outside trade. he has also received push back from members of the lower class who do not wish to assist with tasks previously performed by parshmen, as they believe they are above menial tasks. notes[edit]"
Highprince of Information,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Highprince_of_Information,"the highprince of information is a title bestowed by the alethi king to one of the highprinces. the highprince of information has authority over criminal investigations, particularly those of interest to the crown. the title also grants permission to enter another highprince's land and question their servants and troops. denying the highprince of information access to these could be taken as denying the kings will. history[edit] as torol sadeas suggested, king elhokar made him highprince of information. his first task was the investigation of a suspected assassination attempt on the king during a chasmfiend hunt, but sadeas disproved that assertion later. sadeas renounced the title of highprince of information later, in order to distance himself from the king's authority and antagonize the throne and dalinar, as it had been his idea to institute these functions into elhokar's kingdom as a means of preparing the other highprinces for his nomination as highprince of war. after the relocation to urithiru and sadeas' murder, highprince aladar was named highprince of information by dalinar. he tasks aladar with establishing law and order in urithiru, and making sure the other highprinces know their realms of control with urithiru. aladar moves forward and uses his scribes and military as a policing force and to investigate. as it was not in dalinar's own authority to do so, it can be surmised that either elhokar ratified this decision after the fact or that he gave his uncle the authority to make this nomination in his name beforehand. notes[edit]"
Danlan Morakotha,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Danlan_Morakotha,"brightness danlan morakotha is an alethi woman who courted adolin kholin on the shattered plains of roshar during the war of reckoning. she is a member of the diagram. appearance and personality[edit] danlan is extremely pretty. she has a graceful figure with a long neck, and her hair has more foreign auburn stripes then black alethi stripes. she wears a sleek dress that covers her safehand and an ornate braided hairstyle with steel hair spikes. her voice is soft, with a breathy and husky tone. danlan is an extremely intelligent woman, but she often acts less clever than she really is in an attempt at humility, and is annoyed when adolin points it out. she is polite and seems well-versed in the traditions of alethi nobility. danlan is also quite fond of avramelons and enjoys drinking wine, often coordinating her wine color with her outfit. she is seen drinking violet wine, the strongest available. attributes and abilities[edit] danlan is presumably of noble birth; she worked with elhokar's scribes in kholinar and adolin had no misgivings about courting her. she is familiar with the use of a spanreed and is able to read and write in women's script. she is well informed on the politics among the highprinces and was able to avidly discuss torol sadeas's motivations in his interactions with dalinar kholin and whether or not dalinar should step down as highprince due to his visions. she felt that dalinar's enforcement of the alethi codes of war was too restrictive on the men in the warcamps. danlan joined the secret organization known as the diagram under unknown circumstances. she was considered a middling member of the group before it was disbanded. history[edit] before traveling to the shattered plains, danlan spent three years in kholinar helping the scribes sort through the mess elhokar had made of the royal codes. courting adolin[edit] danlan traveled to the shattered plains to spend a few months with her father, brightlord morakotha. the day after her arrival, she was already calling on adolin. he arranged for her to become one of his father's clerks, participating in his spanreed calls and serving as a scribe. she was therefore immediately privy to some of dalinar's confidential conversations; she was controlling the spanreed when jasnah called to ask dalinar about the time he met the parshendi and show him a drawing of a ""voidbringer"". danlan met with navani, who liked her and was impressed her with her intelligence; she encouraged adolin to pursue her. adolin took her to an outer market wineshop before one of his duels. danlan participated in the conversation with jakamav, inkima, toral and eshava, and she tended to stay on the topic of politics. although adolin did not know danlan well, he was attracted to her and was committed to making their courtship last longer than his typical brief relationships. however, some months later adolin was surprisingly the one to break off their courtship, due to some inappropriate things danlan had told her friends, likely related to some flirting by adolin. the breakup was not amicable, and involved danlan cursing at adolin. she remained as one of dalinar's scribes, and whenever she ran into adolin she glared at him. graves's conspiracy[edit] as a member of the diagram, she was part of graves's plot to kill elhokar and replace him with dalinar; she was present when moash brought kaladin to meet with graves and several co-conspirators. her personal experience with elhokar's lax approach to lawmaking led her to believe that he was incompetent. she fervently believed that dalinar would be a better king, and wanted to force the issue before elhokar did further damage to the kingdom. danlan was not with graves or moash during the final assassination attempt nor when they fled the shattered plains. disbanding of the diagram[edit] when taravangian disbanded the diagram prior to the betrayal of the coalition of monarchs in emul, he recommended that middling members who ""knew too much"" should not be released back into the general population and should instead be sent on long ""secret quests"" to distant locations. he specifically recommended that danlan be assigned such a task. notes[edit]"

bridge four and a windrunner of the third ideal on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] ""“a one-armed herdazian is still twice as useful as a no-brained alethi. ”-lopen"" like all herdazians, lopen has slate-colored crystalline fingernails. he is a short, spindly, brown-haired man in his early twenties, with skin just a shade too dark to be alethi. he had an old slave brand on his forehead, but that is now covered with a bridge four tattoo. most strikingly, when he joins bridge four he is missing his left arm, although he eventually regrows it with stormlight. he speaks with a quick accent and has a tendency to use herdazian words like gon, gancho, or mancha when referring to people he's talking to. lopen has a very positive outlook in life. despite experiencing great misfortunes, he never accepts these things as part of his identity, and even jokes about his disability. he is often nonchalant, exhibits the stereotypical herdazian arrogance (e.g. calling himself ""the lopen"" and liberally using rude gestures when insulted,) and has a sense of humor that people around him find strange. even so, lopen proves himself to be both compassionate and reliable. lopen refers to himself as ""the lopen"", this nickname was first used by his cousins because they didn't know of anyone else named lopen. lopen has asked many people (one to two hundred) and none of them have ever known anyone named lopen other than himself. attributes and abilities[edit] surgebinding[edit] lopen has the ability to manipulate the surges of adhesion and gravitation through his nahel bond with the honorspren rua. after lopen swore the third ideal of the windrunners, rua gained the ability to become a shardblade, which can be summoned in the form that he chooses, including a dagger. along with rock and huio, lopen is one of the only members of bridge four that can swim. history[edit] early life[edit] lopen's family left herdaz when he was a baby and he was raised in alethkar. he lost his left arm through circumstances that have not yet been revealed. at some point he was enslaved; when or why this happened is unknown, but kaladin noted upon meeting lopen that his slave brand looked old. bridge four[edit] ""“hey, gancho! hey! you want me, i think. you can use me. we herdazians are great fighters, gon. you see, this one time, i was with, sure, three men and they were drunk and all but i still beat them. ”-lopen volunteering for recruitment."" unlike many of the bridge four members, lopen supposedly did not hide a dark past. he was sent to the bridge crews not as punishment for a crime, but only because he was a nuisance. he was not even aware of his situation, as he apparently thought he was entering the army as a soldier. he was the only person among the newcomers who did not have a defeated look of apathy on his face, and the only one volunteering to be picked when kaladin came looking for a new recruit. knowing that lopen would probably not survive a single bridge run in other crews, kaladin decided to choose him, instead of one of the taller men as he'd originally planned. kaladin assigned lopen to carry water for the crew during bridge runs. he was accompanied in this task by dabbid and any member who for one reason or another could not help with carrying the bridge. this allowed such people to remain safe during bridge runs while still being considered useful, whereas in other bridge crews they would have been sacrificed by placing them in front of the bridge to take parshendi arrows. lopen's small team also carried medical supplies for kaladin later on, as well as other items like rope and parshendi carapace armor. eventually lopen learned medical first aid from kaladin and was given medic duties as well. during the battle of the tower, while unable to fight, lopen helped by ensuring that kaladin always had a spear in hand. he did this by taking spears from fallen alethi soldiers and tossing one to kaladin when needed. after bridge four rescued the kholin army in that battle, dalinar kholin had all torol sadeas' bridgemen freed, including lopen. with the former bridge crews now a battalion headed by kaladin under dalinar's camp, bridge four members were given new responsibilities. lopen was assigned as second lieutenant to the battalion's quartermaster, rock, with dabbid and shen under him. as a bridge four member, lopen also became part of dalinar's personal guard, and like the others was given an official uniform on the same day that he received the tattoos that covered his slave brand. lopen took part in kaladin's experiments with radiant powers, allowing himself to be stuck on walls and even joining in a sparring match with rock and sigzil against a stormlight-invested kaladin. he stayed behind in the warcamp during the battle of narak to take care of the barrack and to watch over an injured kaladin. king of alethkar[edit] after kaladin thwarted an assassination attempt on king elhokar, the wounded king was taken to lopen's home in little herdaz to recover. deciding to conceal the king for his own safety, but being averse to lying, lopen's family members somehow persuaded elhokar to temporarily abdicate in favor of lopen so that they could truthfully say that ""king elhokar"" was not with them. this made lopen the legitimate king of alethkar for several minutes. later on lopen tried to convince the alethi to add him to their list of kings, but to no avail. radiant[edit] ""“oh, storms yes! everybody, give the lopen your spheres! i have glowing that needs to be done. ”-lopen after succeeding in investing stormlight and realizing that he could grow back his left arm"" lopen always found kaladin's abilities fascinating, particularly the ability to absorb stormlight. he desired to ""glow"" like kaladin, so much so that he was the only member of bridge four at the time who actively pursued becoming a knight radiant. he eventually became one of kaladin's squires, finally achieving his dream of glowing, soon after kaladin spoke the third ideal of windrunners. through the healing effect of stormlight, lopen was able to restore his missing arm. as a windrunner squire, lopen was able to harness the lashings. he was particularly fond of using them to hang upside-down on ceilings, to the annoyance of others. however, squires need to be in relative proximity to their knight for their powers to manifest, and so lopen lost access to the lashings whenever kaladin went on distant missions. this did not stop him from joining shallan davar and others in fighting the unmade re-shephir within urithiru. kaladin assigned lopen to help the first, second, and third squads of the newly augmented bridge four to achieve squireship. he tried to impress them by flying but, not having mastered basic lashing yet at that point, he ended up just accidentally sticking himself to the ground with a full lashing, all the while insisting he'd meant to do it. he participated in the battle of thaylen field, fighting the fused. lopen later became a knight radiant in his own right, bonding with a male honorspren named rua. he stopped during the clean up after the battle to try and comfort a thaylen soldier who had lost an arm in the fighting. while lopen was explaining the immortal words to the wounded man, he said the second ideal of the windrunners, which the stormfather accepted despite the fact that lopen had been trying to save it for a dramatic moment. expedition to aimia[edit] a few months after the battle of thaylen field, lopen and huio were chosen by kaladin to join the thaylen expedition to akinah aboard the wandersail as they were capable of swimming, and did not yet have blades. rysn took to him quickly on account of his personality, and the two bonded over shared experience with disability. he also endeared himself to the ardent rushu by engaging in discussion of her artifabrian projects. lopen chastised huio for tinkering with rushu's spanreed - an activity that ultimately results in the discovery of aluminum-modified fabrials. after nikli's plot to sabotage the expedition was uncovered, lopen and huio were tasked with flying the sleepless and its assistant, plamry, to shore for incarceration. as the ship crossed through the storm surrounding akinah lopen remained on deck, using stormlight to adhere the captain's foot to the deck for stability. lopen dove into the water to rescue turlm when he was tossed overboard. with rua's help, he was the first to notice a shadow in the depths that would turn out to be a large hordeling following the ship. once they landed on akinah, lopen and rushu split from the main group to search for a sign of the aimian oathgate - a task given to them by navani. using lashings to fly, lopen identified the layout of ancient akinah from above, giving rushu proof that her sketches had been correct. a lack of crem buildup led both to conclude that the real city (and the real oathgate) had been hidden underground by someone wishing to deter exploration. when they found the oathgate chamber, lopen realized that they had placed themselves in a compromised position and risked attack from whatever force wanted the island hidden. as he was racing back to the ship, lopen ran into a giant hordeling and he rescued huio from its jaws. the two proceeded to fight the creature together to give the crew a chance to escape. lopen tried to swear the third ideal, but was unsuccessful, which caused him to ask rua if phendorana had a hand in preventing his progress. he attempted another attack, but a hordeling bred to have the powers of a larkin drained away his stormlight causing him to fall down to the ground and break his leg. when the monster turned towards him huio flew between lopen and the creature, swore the third ideal and proceeded to summon caelinora as a shardhammer which he used to shatter the hordeling's arm. shortly afterward, huio killed it with a shardspear through the head. the two escaped while rysn's negotiation continued underground. back at the ship, lopen and huio discussed the third ideal. lopen congratulated his cousin on beating him to the ideal, although struggled to do so as he had an inkling that huio's oath had been related to him and thought huio might harbor ill will for him. lopen took their discussion to heart and vowed to protect others, even if that meant protecting them from himself. the stormfather heard this and accepted lopen's third ideal. emuli campaign[edit] ""“...look into the future and find out if i beat huio at cards tomorrow. ”-lopen to renarin"" lopen participated in the evacuation of hearthstone with his fellow windrunners, engaging the fused in combat. he expressed worry for kaladin's wellbeing on the battlefield, asking if he was alright. following kaladin's retirement, lopen and a majority of the bridge four windrunners joined dalinar's forces on the battlefield in emul. the evening after jasnah deposed highprince ruthar, dalinar and renarin found themselves sitting at one of the bridge four nightly cook fires. as they both stood to leave, lopen called out to renarin and asks him to look into the future, wishing to know if he'll beat huio in a game of cards the following day. lopen later joined with the remaining members of bridge four to celebrate at teft's funeral. relationships[edit] mother[edit] ""“i’m an expert on one-armed herdazian jokes. ‘lopen,’ my mother always says, ‘you must learn these to laugh before others do. then you steal the laughter from them, and have it all for yourself.’ she is a very wise woman. ”-lopen"" lopen thinks highly of his mother, who encouraged his self-deprecating humor as a way to cope with his one-armed condition before he was able to heal himself. he currently lives with her in urithiru. lopen's mother has implied that herdazian families are matriarchal, with the women possessing all authority inside herdazian homes. extended family[edit] ""“a man can never have enough cousins. ”-lopen to earless jaks"" lopen is related in one way or another to a significant portion of the herdazian population in the alethi warcamps and often talks about his many cousins there. he often suggests going to one of his cousins for help, and is quite proud of their loyalty. however, his definition of ""cousin"" is very broad and could include fifth cousins, or people dating his sister or his aunt. in fact, lopen's definition of a ""cousin"" seems to be broad enough to include anyone he feels kinship with, and has nothing to do with actual lineage. when he began earning a stipend as a radiant, he sent most of it to his family to help out the poorer cousins, of which a large part went to rod's family. the following are members of lopen's extended family: huio[edit] lopen shares a playfully antagonistic relationship with his cousin huio. before assigning them to the expedition to aimia, kaladin remarks that he was counting on huio to temper lopen in their dealings with the reshi delegation. after receiving the assignment, lopen plans to go lord it over huio that he lopen had been chosen for the job, before relenting and sharing that huio was also chosen. where huio is reserved and quiet, lopen is effusive and flamboyant. both are intelligent and thoughtful, but show it differently. at various points throughout the journey, lopen makes it a point to try to keep one up on huio. huio does not seem particularly interested in making a game of it. at one point, lopen idly notes that huio's spren caelinora very infrequently makes herself visible to him. during the hordeling battle on the shores of aimia, lopen saves huio from the hordeling's jaws and boasts about it. huio is exasperated and urges lopen to focus on the fight. lopen is initially upset when huio swears the third ideal of the windrunners before himself. he does not realize that huio resents this overt and overbearing teasing from his cousin. in fact, huio's opinion of lopen lead directly to his swearing of the third ideal. the wording is implied to name lopen as the object of his ill will (e.g. i will protect those i hate, even if that is lopen) although huio swears that he does not hate lopen. this, in turn, causes lopen to understand that he must protect people from himself - which becomes his third ideal. cord[edit] lopen seems to be interested in cord romantically, although he never says so aloud. in several internal monologues, he lists her positive attributes (e.g. her pleasing accent, her height, her proximity to him in age), and repeatedly makes attempts to impress her. cord notices his attempts but does not indicate whether this affection is reciprocated. rysn[edit] lopen and rysn traveled together on the expedition to aimia, and repeatedly bond over shared experience with disability - lopen living with one arm, and rysn having lost the use of her lower body. rushu[edit] rushu also traveled on the wandersail at navani's request. her job was partially to investigate fabrials to help rysn regain mobility lost by being unable to walk. lopen and huio engage with her in discussions of fabrials and aluminum, eventually helping her stumble onto the discovery of aluminum-modified fabrials. rushu seems to enjoy lopen's company, at one point commenting that it sounded like he was espousing the works of a philosopher with whom she was familiar. rua[edit] ""“you can thank me, naco, for inspiring this great advance in your learning. people-and little things made out of nothing too, sure-are often inspired near the lopen. ”-lopen to rua, after teaching the spren how to perform a rude gesture"" lopen's spren rua appears to be as carefree as he is, and perhaps more mischievous. rua's transition into the physical realm and his bond with lopen is recent enough that he is not yet fully himself mentally, and lopen acts like a sort of mentor to him, albeit only in matters of mischief. kaladin[edit] ""“if you’re crazy, you’re a good type, and i like you. not a killing-people-in-their-sleep type of crazy. besides, we all follow crazies all the time. do it every day with lighteyes. ”-lopen to kaladin, on whether he'd follow him to battle if he was crazy."" like other members of bridge four, lopen is loyal to their captain, kaladin stormblessed. lopen has been invaluable in many of kaladin's undertakings, acquiring and handling resources necessary to kaladin's plans, providing helpful insights often wrapped in his unique sense of humor, and simply being a trustworthy companion. lopen's lighthearted attitude often contrasts with kaladin's seriousness, and at times the bridge four captain does not know what to make of the herdazian. still, kaladin has acknowledged lopen's ability by promoting him to a leadership position just below that of teft when lopen reached the second ideal of the windrunners. quotes[edit] trivia[edit] - lopen is the name of

Tukks,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tukks,"""“care. the key to fighting isn't lack of passion, it's controlled passion. care about winning. care about those you defend. you have to care about something. ”-tukks"" tukks is an alethi sergeant on roshar. he leads the takers, a squad of soldiers in meridas amaram's army that included kaladin. appearance and personality[edit] tukks is younger than most sergeants. he is a short man with sunken cheeks, and there is something ""off"" about his features. he sometimes chews fathom bark. tukks often chides his men and kaladin considers him to be ""loud, intolerant, and profoundly acerbic"", although he admits that he is wise. tukks is far more empathetic and introspective than other soldiers. attributes and abilities[edit] tukks is highly skilled with a spear, as he trains other soldiers to wield them in battle. he is shocked by kaladin's natural proficiency with the weapon, and is able to help him refine his abilities. he emphasizes the need to practice, both to build skill and to avoid freezing in combat. tukks is an effective military leader. he was promoted to sergeant at a young age, and has a good understanding of the dynamics of his squad. he tries to address facets of their personalities that could negatively affect them on the battlefield. he will discipline them as necessary by assigning them to menial duties or perhaps using corporal punishment. history[edit] tukks joined meridas amaram's army at some point in his youth. by 1169, he was a sergeant and led a squad known as the takers that participated in border skirmishes in the sadeas princedom. kaladin was assigned to this squad when he joined the army. although tukks did help improve kaladin's combat skills, his enduring effect on kaladin was advising him of the need to feel emotion in the midst of battle and to fight with cause. tukks was also able to locate tien on kaladin's behalf, informing kaladin that his brother was serving in the seventh battalion. he offered to try to get tien transferred to the takers, but this never came about. tukks died while in amaram's army, presumably during a battle where kaladin was present; he is one of the people that kaladin regrets being unable to protect. it is unclear what happened to the takers after tukks died; kaladin was soon given command of his own squad that was not known to use the name. relationships[edit] kaladin[edit] ""“don't worry about the war, or even the battle. focus on your squadmates, kal. keep them alive. be the man they need.”-tukks"" during his training with the takers, kaladin froze up while sparring on the practice field, and keenly recalled his subsequent conversation with tukks. tukks emphasized that it was normal to feel fear and passion while fighting, and that not everyone dealt with it the same way. he would not want to fight alongside people who felt no emotion. kaladin struggled to reconcile how tukks could allow himself to care and still hurt people, and tukks said he focused on keeping his squadmates alive. kaladin had difficulty understanding tukks's point of view at first, but later realized that caring about the fight was the difference between retaining your humanity and becoming a murderer. he did not freeze on the battlefield again until the siege of kholinar, when he was forced to watch two groups of friends killing each other. kaladin looks back on his time with tukks fondly. the need to feel emotion on the battlefield was the first lesson that he taught bridge four. he feels a sense of familiarity and strength when he falls into a stance that tukks taught him. quotes[edit] ""“the first step is to care. some talk about being emotionless in battle. well, i suppose it's important to keep your head. but i hate that feeling of killing while calm and cold. i've seen that those who care fight harder, longer, and better than those who don't. it's the difference between mercenaries and real soldiers. it's the difference between fighting to defend your homeland and fighting on foreign stone.it's good to care when you fight, so long as you don't let it consume you. don't try to stop yourself from feeling. you'll hate who you become. ”-tukks's advice to kaladin"" ""“a lot of soldiers, they think that you fight the best if you’re passionless and cold. i think that’s stormleavings. yes, you need to be focused. yes, emotions are dangerous. but if you don’t care about anything, what are you? an animal, driven only to kill. our passion is what makes us human. we have to fight for a reason. so i say that it’s all right to care. we’ll talk about controlling your fear and anger, but remember this as the first lesson i taught you. ”-kaladin passing on tukks's lesson to bridge four"" notes[edit]"
Rillir Roshone,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rillir,"""“i'm cityheir. my duty is to lead-to see that jobs get done and that people are occupied in productive work. and as such, i give important tasks to idling darkeyes to make them useful. ”-rillir to kaladin"" rillir roshone is a lighteyed alethi on roshar and the son of brightlord toralin roshone. he comes to hearthstone after his father's exile from kholinar due to a political scandal. he courts laral wistiow prior to his death. appearance and personality[edit] rillir is young and handsome, with blue eyes. he speaks with a smooth city accent. rillir is arrogant and condescending. he is particularly bigoted towards darkeyes, believing that its their purpose to serve him; he often overlooks them as if they aren’t there unless he wants them to do something for him. he finds living in hearthstone to be ""provincial"" and boring, and the accommodations to be dreary. he likes going on dangerous hunts with his father, and believes they are among the few benefits of living in a rural area. history[edit] rillir was presumably raised in kholinar, where his father toralin owned several silversmith shops. toralin was a minor lighteyes, but he had family connections that gained him the favor of elhokar kholin and torol sadeas until he became embroiled in a scandal that resulted in the death of moash's grandparents, ana and da. in late 1166, toralin was exiled to hearthstone and given authority over the local mansion and surrounding lands. rillir soon joined him there. sadeas provided laral with a dowry since roshone was given the land that was previously held by her father, brightlord wistiow; by 1168 laral and rillir were in a relationship and heading towards a marriage that would solidify the political alliance between their families. when lirin and kaladin went to roshone's manor to dine with him and discuss the spheres left to them by wistiow, kaladin saw laral with rillir in another room, telling her about how he intended to take his father out on a hunt to brighten his spirits. although he was only about two years older than kaladin, rillir treated him like a serving boy and mentioned his beliefs that as a lighteyes, it was his place in life to be served and dictate to darkeyes how to serve him. he humiliated kaladin until laral redirected his attention. ""“i would save him if i could, i promise you. but i cannot.”-lirin to roshone"" rillir suffered grevious wounds during a whitespine hunt. his abdomen was speared through with a whitespine tusk, his lower right leg was crushed and badly mangled, and the right side of his face was mauled, with most of the skin scraped off. he and his father were brought to lirin and kaladin for surgery. lirin judged rillir to be beyond recovery and made the decision to let him die on the surgery table, despite toralin's demands that he continue treatment. kaladin used dazewater to put rillir at peace as he died. toralin narrowly survived his injuries, although he became reclusive and lost a great deal of weight while mourning his son. he held a grudge against lirin due to rillir's death, and sent tien into amaram's army in revenge. toralin went on to marry laral himself since he could not afford to overlook the political opportunity. relationships[edit] laral[edit] ""“you're as provincial as my father sometimes, dear. ”-rillir to laral"" rillir began courting laral upon his arrival in hearthstone; this was presumably encouraged by his father and torol sadeas due to the political connections it would give to roshone. she and rillir seemed to get along fairly well, although kaladin noticed a change in laral's personality and bearing during her relationship with rillir. she adopted rillir's haughty attitude towards darkeyes, although she still maintained a modicum of empathy towards kaladin. laral seemed to genuinely care for rillir; when he was grievously wounded by a whitespine, laral was in hysterics, screaming at kaladin and lirin to treat him. notes[edit]"
Lurg,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lurg,"a lurg is an amphibian on roshar. appearance and anatomy[edit] lurgs are fist-sized amphibians. their skin is brown and green and appears slick. this slickness is likely due to the mucus that they secrete. a lurg moves by jumping quickly from place to place, leaving spots of mucus behind it. it is able to cling to rocks using its six legs, at least two of which have tiny hands. a lurg's eyes are located near the center of its back. ecology[edit] lurgs are known to inhabit northern alethkar. it is likely that they also live in tashikk, implying widespread distribution on the rosharan continent. a lurg feeds on insects that come out during a rainstorm. lurgs will find a crevice in the rock and spin themselves a cocoon of white silk, making it spherical with their hands. the container is water-tight from the inside, sealed by the lurg's mucus, but will dissolve during a rainstorm so that the lurg can come out to hunt. due to this unique trait, children often go hunting for lurgs to pour water on them and dissolve the cocoon, tricking the lurg into running about. the lurgs will quickly tire when they do not find food, and will stop jumping if this trick is repeated more than a few times. children also sometimes keep them for pranks, such as putting a lurg into someone's bathwater. history[edit] kaladin and tien enjoyed playing with lurgs while they were growing up in hearthstone, and tien was particularly fascinated by them. lift also liked to catch lurgs. when kaladin and syl were hiking to hearthstone in the wake of the everstorm, syl spotted a lurg. she was entertained by it and briefly changed form to imitate it. when kaladin was fighting leshwi outside of hearthstone he used some cocooned lurgs to distract her and gain a momentary advantage in the fight. trivia[edit] - in - , - are described as lurglike; they have bulbous bodies, long tongues, and squat legs. notes[edit]"
Jam (Hearthstone),https://coppermind.net/wiki/Jam_(Hearthstone),"jam is a man from the town of hearthstone in rural alethkar on roshar. he is two years older than kaladin. history[edit] jam's father served as a soldier in brightlord amaram's army; he was well known to lirin because he had operated multiple times on a lingering leg injury. when kaladin was ten years old, he and tien liked to watch jam train in the quarterstaff with his father. lirin doubted that jam actually wanted to hang out with the younger boys. jam still lived in hearthstone at the time of its evacuation to urithiru on the fourth bridge in 1175. he moved to the tower and lived with the rest of the refugees on the sixth floor. when raboniel and her forces invaded the tower, he found a spear somewhere and tried to resist them; he was the only refugee that was injured. hesina presumably tended to his wounds. notes[edit]"
Wistiow,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Wistiow,"brightlord wistiow is a lighteyed alethi and the citylord of hearthstone prior to the vengeance pact. a friend of lirin's, wistiow is a frail man who has one daughter, laral. upon his death he leaves no male heir behind, so citylord roshone is appointed to take his place. personality[edit] ""“brightlord wistiow let men do as they wished. and so they ignored him. roshone lets them know he finds them contemptible. and so they scramble to please him. ”-lirin on wistiow"" little of wistiow's personality is known, but things may be ascertained. he is not an ostentatious lighteyes, keeping only a single elderly horse and paying little attention to the grounds of his manor. in fact, wistiow has contempt for lighteyes that spent their time hunting. he and lirin joke that such lighteyes will kill beasts only if there are no men around to kill. wistiow is an easygoing and passive citylord; he primarily lets his people do as they wish, although they are mostly ambivalent towards wistiow himself, not overly striving to please him. wistiow himself may be somewhat stuffy, but he also is likely a generous man who cares for his people, as lirin firmly believes that wistiow would have paid for kaladin's training as a surgeon had he had the chance before his death. he also calls for lirin to come set the broken arm of a young parshman, although later the singer in question, abiajan, questions whether the event only took place because wistiow had paid a good price for her. history[edit] time as citylord[edit] little is known about wistiow's early life or marriage, but at some point in his life he became citylord of hearthstone and fathered a daughter, laral wistiow. during his tenure as citylord, wistiow tended to allow his people to live their lives as they wished. wistiow kept a small staff, including a footman, a butler, a nurse for his daughter, and several clerks and parshmen. wistiow also employed a man named miliv who worked for wistiow as his head steward, as well as a cook named barm. throughout his life, wistiow was always a frail man. during his time as citylord, wistiow became friends with lirin, the town's surgeon. the two often joked about other lighteyes, and wistiow and lirin also had made plans that their children, kaladin and laral, might one day wed. house wistiow was a relatively poor family of little renown, and both could benefit from the connection. wistiow may even have promised that he would fund sending kaladin's training as a surgeon in kharbranth to take care of his town.[fn 1] death[edit] ""“brightlord wistiow has been carried by the winds. ”-lirin to kaladin on wistiow's death"" around early 1166, an army passed through hearthstone and asked citylord wistiow's permission to recruit a few of the older boys in town. a few weeks later, wistiow became ill and lirin began to treat him in his mansion. within a week, wistiow's already frail health had diminished substantially and he lost lucidity as he entered his final days. knowing the marriage between kaladin and laral was now in jeopardy, lirin prepared the appropriate documents, as well as a simple will written in glyphs that would grant kaladin a supply of diamond broams to fund his education in kharbranth. he had wistiow's scribes read the message to the man before wistiow sent them away. wistiow was not coherent enough to stamp the documents, so lirin did it himself. wistiow passed away shortly thereafter. legacy[edit] ""“[the people of hearthstone are] my responsibility, now that wistiow has gone. i can’t leave them to roshone. ”-lirin on wistiow's death"" wistiow's death lead to a period of severe hardship in hearthstone, as he was the last male of his line. this meant that he was replaced after several months by citylord roshone, who had been exiled to hearthstone for his actions in the capital. the odd circumstances surrounding wistiow's death lead to rumors circulating among the townspeople, perhaps spread by miliv, that lirin had written the document and tricked a confused wistiow into signing it. this suspicion was only exacerbated by roshone upon his arrival, as he wished to add the funds to the meager lands and property he had received from the wistiow estate. the planned engagement of kaladin and laral also fell through under roshone, as laral had not yet reached her day of majority and roshone was unwilling to let her dowry go. instead he engaged her to his own son rillir to tie their family to a respectable house. following rillir's death, laral was engaged to roshone himself instead. lirin found himself unable to leave hearthstone despite the difficulties his family faced because he still felt like no one would care for the citizens of hearthstone once wistiow had passed away. notes[edit]"

she wears it long and for a while dyes it totally black. in the years prior to the true desolation, her appearance matures somewhat, her face becoming firm and lean. she also begins to wear her undyed hair in a tail and to wear much more utilitarian clothing than the fancier clothing she had worn previously. while hearthstone was occupied by the fused, laral wore a simple servant's dress, along with a gloved safe hand instead of a sleeve. history[edit] early life[edit] laral was a childhood friend of kaladin's while they grew up together in hearthstone; they played together, and kaladin often ate with her in the kitchens of her father's mansion. as they both matured, she began to flirt with him and he began to return her feelings. one day, she, kaladin, and tien were out hunting lurgs when they noticed a group of boys congregating idly instead of worming the lavis polyps. laral led kaladin down to the others and thrust him into what was a very confusing confrontation for him, before returning home after jost beat kaladin with his quarterstaff. her father, who had been ill for several days, died that day while he was tended to by lirin. laral inherited the rest of wistiow's wealth and was given a dowry by highprince torol sadeas in lieu of the authority over hearthstone and her father's old property. marriage[edit] ""“you take after your father. always feeling like you need to save everyone, even those who would rather you mind your own business.”-laral to kaladin"" for several months after her father's death, laral was confined to the mansion. with the coming of brightlord roshone, she turned to courting his son and heir, rillir. she began dressing as a true alethi lighteyed woman in an effort to capture rillir's attention, going so far as to treat kaladin like an errand boy when the she and rillir encountered him in the mansion's kitchen. laral was at lirin's surgery room with rillir after he was gored by a whitespine, panicking and yelling before her guards took her away. after rillir's death from his wounds, she eventually became betrothed to brightlord roshone himself. she wore a bride's prayer glyph on her sleeve the day that highprince amaram arrived and took tien and kaladin into his army, though they did not formally announce their engagement at the time. at some point during the years 1168 to 1174, laral married roshone. when kaladin returned to hearthstone in 1174, laral berated him for damaging her floor with his shardblade and, more importantly, for thinking that she needed ""saving"" from her marriage to roshone. she expressed willingness to help the citizens of hearthstone weather the new everstorms and the lack of parshmen, then operated a spanreed for kaladin so he could speak with dalinar before heading back to urithiru. the occupation of hearthstone[edit] laral conspired with lirin to protect the herdazian general known as the mink, who was posing as a refugee. the plan is interrupted as lezian arrives. kaladin is revealed to be amongst the refugees, instigating a battle. during the battle, laral's home (the citylord's manor) is burned by lezian. laral's husband roshone is killed by vyre within the manor. laral is evacuated via the fourth bridge to urithiru. under jasnah's new inheritance laws, laral gained the title of citylady of hearthstone, which entitled her to meet queen jasnah at urithiru. relationships[edit] kaladin[edit] ""“kal, if you go to war and find a shardblade, then you'd be a lighteyes... i mean... oh, this is useless. ”-laral to kaladin"" laral and kaladin are friends while growing up together in hearthstone, though as they grow older, she becomes kaladin's first crush. kaladin's parents encourage him to play with her with the hope that one day they would marry. in the meantime, laral herself encourages kaladin to become a soldier and win a shardblade so that, as a lighteyes, he could be her equal in a marriage. when she moves on from him and becomes romantically involved with the roshones, kaladin has a difficult time accepting that she is doing so of her own choice. roshone[edit] when roshone was been given authority over hearthstone, including possession of the mansion and surrounding lands, highprince sadeas gave laral a dowry in compensation. because of this, roshone saw the need of marrying her into her family. she was originally engaged to his son, rillir, but after his death in a hunting accident, this engagement was made to roshone himself. by the time of the true desolation, laral and roshone had been married for several years. she claims satisfaction with the agreement and even defends him before kaladin when he spoke ill of her husband. she seems to have used the marriage to become politically engaged and has strong loyalty from their soldiers. laral and roshone's children, twins, were evacuated from hearthstone and now reside in urithiru. when roshone dies, laral inherits the title of citylady under jasnah's new inheritance laws. notes[edit]"
Ral,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ral,"""“ master ral likes things you can use. things to sit on, things to put clothes in. but i think i can make a good chair tomorrow, something that will make him proud. ”- tien"" ral is a darkeyed carpenter from hearthstone in alethkar. he has a shop in the town and employs several apprentices. history[edit] ral learned carpentry from his father, whom he succeeded as the town's carpenter in 1166. he eventually hired two apprentices, and in the second year of citylord roshone's governance, ral hired tien as well--likely in an act of aid to lirin's family, as ral had little need of additional help. later that year, he expressed disappointment in tien's poor productivity, as the young boy would often get distracted with projects which did not prove useful or profitable. notes[edit]"
Toralin Roshone,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Roshone,"brightlord toralin roshone is a lighteyes in alethkar on roshar. he is the citylord of hearthstone. he is the father of rillir roshone and husband of laral roshone. appearance and personality[edit] roshone is middle-aged, with a short, grey-streaked beard and an angry expression. he has light yellow eyes that seem to blame everyone and everything for his banishment. he wears a sword and a takama, but appears too old and flabby to be a true soldier, and his weight increases during his time in hearthstone. he dresses out of fashion and wears a wooden foot on his right leg. though he cares about the outward appearance of his manor, he makes few alterations inside. he is vindictive towards kaladin's family, and dalinar kholin considers him a petty man. by the time of the true desolation, he seems to soften--perhaps because of guilt. attributes and abilities[edit] roshone doesn't have any outstanding ability or attribute other than being a lesser lighteye with some connections. when he lived in kholinar, roshone was one of highprince sadeas' sworn liegemen and cousin to important men whose support the kholin family needed for political reasons. since being exiled to hearthstone, roshone's influence and wealth are greatly diminished. as citylord of a small town, roshone has no stewardship over any of the highprince's lands and is little more than a first point of contact for higher ranking lighteyes. history[edit] kholinar and the roshone affair[edit] roshone owned several silversmith shops in kholinar, and used his connection with elhokar kholin to further his own interests. he had become a confidant of elhokar, who was then the crown-prince of alethkar--in charge of overseeing the country while his father was away at the shattered plains. roshone convinced the prince to arrest two elderly darkeyed silversmiths, his business rivals and moash's grandparents, on false charges; they died in prison awaiting trial. upon discovering what had happened, dalinar initially wanted to strip roshone of his rank and wealth, but political pressures forced him to instead exile roshone to ""a place he couldn't do any more harm."" citylord of hearthstone[edit] ""“you hid behind the law, sneering at me, surgeon. well, now it turns against you. keep those spheres! the look on your face at this moment is worth the price of every one of them!”-roshone to lirin upon nominating tien to serve in the army"" roshone was shipped to hearthstone as punishment for the deaths of moash's grandparents in late 1166. he became the new citylord of the town, where the previous citylord, wistiow, had died. from the very beginning, he suspected that lirin stole spheres from citylord wistiow. he treated lirin and his family badly, and, under threat of roshone's bad graces, the rest of the townspeople followed suit. amid the social and financial pressure placed on lirin, roshone invited the man to dine in his manor one evening, in hopes of cutting a deal to recover the stolen spheres. though there was a debate between roshone and lirin, it didn't bring him a satisfying result. eventually roshone and his son rillir were both badly injured on a whitespine hunt. lirin, hearthstone's surgeon, saved roshone's life but could not help rillir. after the loss of his son and leg, roshone became a recluse and his dislike for lirin grew. with no heir of his own, he made plans to marry the daughter of former citylord wistiow, laral, himself. when brightlord amaram, a distant cousin of roshone, came through the town to recruit during the weeping of 1168, roshone took his revenge by deciding that tien would join the army. in the years that followed roshone married laral, and his treatment of lirin and hesina softened. as the man aged, he gave way to laral to manage most of the house and town's affairs. after the everstorm[edit] roshone's manor survived the everstorm with minimal damage, and he sheltered the village in it. the parlor became a surgeon's triage room, with mats laid out on the floor bearing wounded. when kaladin arrived to their manor bearing a slave brand, roshone's first instinct was to bully him, but after a punch to his face and a display of kaladin's shardblade, he relented. the revelation that the true desolation had arrived caused roshone to sink further, and kaladin was unable to encourage him before laral took command of the situation and he retreated to his room. occupation of alethkar to hearthstone evacuation[edit] under the rule of the singers and the fused, all lighteyes were made equal to darkeyes. roshone was reduced to menial work and drinking. he and his wife laral were part of lirin's mission to smuggle in the mink, and roshone provided the distraction on cue- engaging in drunken antics to distract the singer guards, who were particularly fond of watching a former brightlord who owned them or their likes reduced to a drunkard and a worker. relationships[edit] rillir[edit] after roshone's own political failures, he did what he could to secure his only son's future--arranging for rillir to marry former citylord wistiow's daughter, laral. disappointed by his father's dark mood after their relocation to hearthstone, rillir convinced his father to go on a hunt for entertainment, which ended with an accident and rillir's death. while the boy was mortally wounded, roshone demanded that the surgeon save rillir before tending his own life-threatening wounds. laral[edit] when roshone was been given authority over hearthstone, including possession of the mansion and surrounding lands, highprince sadeas gave laral a dowry in compensation. because of this, roshone saw the need of marrying her into her family. she was originally engaged to his son, rillir, but after his death in a hunting accident, this engagement was made to roshone himself. by the time of the true desolation, laral and roshone had been married for several years. she claims satisfaction with the agreement and even defends him before kaladin when he spoke ill of her husband. she seems to have used the marriage to become politically engaged and has strong loyalty from their soldiers. lirin[edit] ""“you're the one who let old wistiow die. in a way, it's your fault i'm in this pitiful, miserable quarter of the kingdom. ”-roshone to lirin when they meet in hearthstone"" roshone and lirin have had a complicated relationship since they met. when lirin welcomed their new brightlord, roshone's reply was to blame him for letting wistiow die. their relationship worsened when he found that lirin had a goblet full of spheres, claiming that it was a gift from wistiow before his death. roshone made it public that he believed lirin had stolen them. this changed the relationship between lirin and the town, and the townspeople simply stopped their donations, all at a word from roshone. further pressure from roshone to recover the spheres was unsuccessful, though roshone believed that he would eventually win. after a hunting accident, lirin was able to preserve roshone's life at the cost of his leg, but the surgeon was unable to save roshone's son, rillir, despite the citylord's protests. this sealed the bad relationship between them, and it culminated in roshone choosing tien to go to war and kaladin following to protect him. with this, lirin lost both his sons in one day by roshone's doing. years later, after the everstorm came, kaladin returned to hearthstone and found that lirin and roshone had a better relationship, probably because of roshone's guilt. kaladin[edit] kaladin was deeply influenced by roshone in many ways, including his negative views on lighteyes. kaladin's life changed after he met roshone. his family was cornered to eating low cost food and were alienated from the townpeople. as roshone and lirin's relationship worsen, so did kaladin's life, ending in him going after tien to amaram's army. another collateral damage for kaladin was losing laral, both as friend and as possible love interest. after roshone's arrival, he decided she would be married into his family. kaladin finally makes peace with roshone after the everstorm, when he returns to hearthstone. though he wants revenge and punches him at their reunion, kaladin then puts roshone's petty actions into perspective and determines to forgive the citylord to some degree. he recognizes he doesn't have any passion on abusing him and prompts him to be a good leader to his town in time of need.

Oroden,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Oroden,"oroden is the youngest child of lirin and hesina, and kaladin's baby brother. oroden, along with the rest of the people of hearthstone, was sheltered in roshone's manor when the true desolation came to roshar. kaladin estimates him to be about a year old when he meets him for the first time. his name means 'child of peace'. history[edit] oroden was relocated to urithiru with the population of hearthstone, where he lives on the sixth floor with his parents, sleeping in a small closet. kaladin visits and plays with him at least once. when urithiru is assaulted by odium's forces, oroden was initially taken care of by a 'village girl', presumably from hearthstone. oroden is present when soldiers come to take fallen radiants from lirin's care into custody, and begins crying when after kaladin kills the regal in protection of teft. after this, lirin, hesina and oroden are imprisoned in the the clinic, held by lezian's guards, and later by leshwi's after venli intervenes. the family stays together when lirin and hesina begin looking after the fallen radiants. notes[edit]"

Heritage Faction,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Heritage_Faction,"the heritage faction is the ruling faction of the rose empire on sel during wan shailu's imprisonment. it was one of the eighty factions of the rose empire. defining characteristics[edit] ""“the forgery of the soul, that was what they considered an abomination. ”-shai on the heritage faction's opinion towards forgery"" the heritage faction sought to honor the accomplishments and knowledge of past cultures. they rebuilt their wing of the rose palace in imitation of an ancient building. using forgery, they recreate examples of famous artwork or cultural pieces to furnish the palace, often in a style known as the lamio style. they distinguish the practice by terming it remembering, due to the poor opinion of forgers in the rose empire. in addition to recreating the palace, the heritage faction often attempts to sway public opinion by reviving old holidays and feasts. the feasts were previously unknown or forgotten, and the effort was often misplaced as the only individuals with sway over the election of a new emperor were the incumbent arbiters of the eighty factions. ashravan's new soul[edit] after a failed assassination attempt on emperor ashravan's life, which left him brain dead, the arbiters of the heritage faction hid him away from the empire under the guise of the mourning for his wife. the arbiters coerced the forger shai into forging a new soul for the emperor, a task she felt was impossible. with the exception of gaotona, all of the arbiters of the heritage faction visited shai during her work and expressed interest in her making the emperor easier to control or manipulate to their own ends. out of pride of craftsmanship, the final soulstamp left ashravan free of such modifications, although she did put into place some triggers that would prompt ashravan into becoming the emperor he had desired to become. members[edit] - emperor - senior arbiter - arbiter - arbiter - arbiter - unnamed arbiter notes[edit]"
Mulla'dil,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Striker,"mulla'dil is the name of both a mountainous region of the rose empire on sel and its inhabitants. after joining the empire, the mulla'dil people are commonly called strikers. history[edit] the nation was subsumed into the empire many years previous to emperor ashravan's reign, and the use of its name was rare in contemporary usage. the people of mulla'dil were well regarded by the grands, although they renamed them strikers after the empire annexed their territory. it was not uncommon for strikers to be elevated. strikers were often employed as guards or soldiers by the empire, although some of them would have preferred a different profession. strikers employed at the rose palace were required to be literate. physical traits[edit] mulla'dil people are generally tall and pale-skinned, with dark, curly hair. they are usually lean and athletic, and some individuals can be described as ""brawny"". culture[edit] although mulla'dil was folded into the empire, its people still maintain a cultural identity, including the ongoing use of the mulla'dil language. the former nation bordered the swamps of dzhamar and there was a deep-seated hatred between the strikers and their neighbors. there is still significant tension caused by the dzhamarian practice of bloodsealing, which the strikers consider to be revolting and unnatural. the antagonism between the two nations may exceed their loyalty to the empire. notes[edit]"

Moash,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Vyre,"""“he couldn't be blamed. he was a product of his culture. ”-moash about himself"" moash, also known as vyre, is an alethi man on roshar. originally a bridgeman in bridge four, he becomes a soldier and bodyguard under kaladin; eventually, he leaves bridge four and switches sides to the diagram, then the fused, serving them as a slave and warrior. he's the current holder of jezrien's honorblade. appearance and personality[edit] appearance[edit] moash is lean, though strong, with a narrow face and brown hair speckled with black. he's born darkeyes, with brown eyes which turn tan after he receives a full set of shards. personality[edit] moash comes off as standoffish and grim, holding people at arm's length when he first meets them. though once he does warm up to someone, he gets attached extremely quickly. once he joins a group, he's friendly and amicable, and often the driving force behind more relaxed, off-duty activities. he values his friendships, and tries to salvage them when he can. he's eager to gain power and he admires those who do have it. at the same time, he's highly suspicious of those above him in the social order. he has a strong sense of justice, originating with the injustice visited on his grandparents earlier in his life. moash tends to view people's actions by the external factors that motivate said actions, external factors such as one's position as a lighteyes or darkeyes in the vorin caste system. as he becomes more involved in the fused army and pushes deeper into odium's emotional voiding, his old priorities slip away. his need to see elhokar and then all lighteyes face retribution consumes him and pushes him further and further away from friends and into the waiting arms of the voidbringers. eventually, as he gives in to odium's power completely, he seems to lose any drive altogether, telling himself he feels no emotions even as he accomplishes his vengeance. in this period, he follows the commandments to seek out passion and follow the orders of the fused. although he continues to care for kaladin, he thinks that suicide is the only way that kaladin can be saved from odium's torment, and in his own despair, urges kaladin to kill himself rather than risk kaladin joining odium. abilities and attributes[edit] moash is a skilled spearman, enough so to kill an attacking fused. for a time, he also has a set of shardblade and shardplate, and though he does have some training with them, he's not particularly good with them and still defaults to the spear when his life is on the line. eventually, he's given jezrien's honorblade, granting him control over the surges of gravitation and adhesion. he appears to be natural at using it, as it takes him no time at all to drink in stormlight and use lashings. he's also a decent spear teacher and commander, able to train a group of singers before the attack on kholinar. following the occupation of urithiru, he was left blind. history[edit] early life[edit] both of moash's parents died when he was a child. he was raised by his grandparents ana and da, who both worked as silversmiths in kholinar. it was his grandfather who named him. later, moash would discover that he has the same name as an ancient singer of some renown, although it is unknown whether his grandfather was aware of this. moash chose not to enter the family business, preferring jobs that involved traveling. while he was working on a caravan for a few months, his grandparents became victims in the roshone affair that led to them dying while incarcerated in the palace dungeons. moash ultimately blamed elhokar kholin, who was then a royal prince but would later become the king of alethkar, for their deaths. bridge four[edit] moash joined the war assuming he would be made a spearman but ended up in bridge four. when bridge four started training down in the chasms, moash was one of the first who changed into a fighting man. later, on the bridgerun where dunny died, moash probably saved kaladin's life by keeping him from reaching dunny's body and later told kaladin that he was wrong about him. when adolin tried to give kaladin the gift of shardblade and shardplate, kaladin instead gave them to moash, thereby making him a lighteyes in rank. his eyes started to lighten a week after, though he still did not consider himself lighteyes. attempted regicide and desertion[edit] ""kaladin: ""sometimes lives must be spent for the greater good."" moash: ""exactly!"" kaladin: ""that's what amaram said. in regards to my men, whom he killed to cover up his theft."" ―conversation between kaladin and moash on the topic of assassinating elhokar"" moash became involved in a plot with graves to assassinate king elhokar kholin, which was ultimately thwarted by kaladin. moash took his plate and blade and fled the warcamps with graves after their failed attempt. they head out into the wilderness with a caravan of stolen goods. graves intended to introduce moash to the diagram, hoping that bringing back a full shardbearer could compensate for his plan's failure. a short while into the trip, they were attacked by a group of fused. graves was killed, and moash attempted to fight with his shardblade, but deemed it too unwieldy. he got hold of a spear and was able to kill one of the fused. upon seeing this, the other fused considered moash to have enough ""passion"" to earn their respect, and gave him the choice between death and slavery. he chose slavery, gave up his shards and his other weapons, and went with them. servant of the fused[edit] as a slave, he pulled supply sledges across the country. on one of his routes, he saw a group of singers pulling sledges like the other slaves. he stood up for the group, gaining more respect among the fused and the singers. eventually, he joined the assault on kholinar as a warrior for the fused's army. in kholinar, he and his singer companions fought with kholinar's wall guard. at the climax of the fight, moash found his way to king elhokar, and stabbed him through the chest. he then stabbed the king again in the eye, just before elhokar could finish swearing the first ideal. his vengeance fulfilled, he looked up to see kaladin, who was in kholinar with the king on a mission to save the city. moash saluted his former captain, who had frozen in shock at what happened, and left. following the siege, he was put to work as a laborer clearing out the debris. there he was approached by a fused, hnanan, who gave him a bright golden knife with a sapphire attached to it. the fused then sent him to assassinate the herald jezrien, whom he killed with the knife. some time after the successful assassination, the fused, leshwi, offered moash jezrien's honorblade as well as a new identity. he accepted, took the singer name vyre, which meant he who quiets, and used the honorblade to join the fused in the air. a year later, moash took part in the fused assault on hearthstone, where he murdered roshone in front of kaladin, who went into a state of battle shock. moash then attempted to persuade kaladin to commit suicide. he was stopped by renarin, who showed moash a vision of the man he could have been had he not betrayed bridge four, a windrunner of the third ideal, causing moash to flee. in kholinar, he sat in on a session of the nine, where he warns them that kaladin will foil their plan to occupy urithiru. later, he was approached by odium, who intended to break kaladin and questioned moash on the best ways of tormenting his former captain. the occupation of urithiru[edit] ""moash: ""i am unchained."" odium: ""and yet, you think so often of kaladin."" moash: ""i am … mostly unchained."" ―moash speaking with odium"" during the occupation of urithiru, vyre used his honorblade to operate the oathgate between kholinar and the tower for the fused. when the uprising to take urithiru back began, he set a trap for kaladin in his family's clinic, but the trap was instead sprung by teft and lift. moash injured lift, then used a raysium dagger containing anti-stormlight to permanently kill teft's spren, phendorana, before killing teft. he handed lirin to the fused as insurance against kaladin, ordering them to kill lirin in front of his son should kaladin fight back. moash then descended to the basement of urithiru to kill queen navani. nearly succeeding, he was ambushed by an injured raboniel, which gave navani time to bond the sibling. after restoring the tower, she used its light to incapacitate moash and forcibly return his pain to him. moash fled, hating himself for what he had done to teft and realizing that he did not truly regret the murder, only the guilt. he eventually broke his spine in a fall and nearly died before being rescued by a few heavenly ones and given stormlight. when he recovered, he found that he was blind. trivia[edit] - though moash's name is similar to - (brandon's editor) it is not actually a cameo. - moash's eye color is initially (and erroneously) written as dark green in - . in - , his eyes are said to be brown. peter ahlstrom has confirmed that moash's eyes are brown and that the first book is incorrect. - the name moash was originally a singer name. - had he not begun killing for odium, moash could have become a windrunner of at least the third ideal.

Jost,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Jost,"jost is a darkeyed man from hearthstone in alethkar on roshar who grew up with kaladin. appearance and personality[edit] as a fourteen-year-old, jost already had the body of a man. he had a broad chest and thick, stocky legs like his father's. he harbored resentment towards kaladin, since he perceived kaladin's surgical training as an easy assignment compared to working in the fields. kaladin cites jost's name as an example of a 'solid, alethi darkeyes' names, unlike his own. history[edit] jost was born into a typical hearthstone family of the fourth or fifth nahn. his parents are farmers, and his father spent time as a soldier. as a child, jost worked in the lavis fields outside of hearthstone with the other darkeyed children of the village, helping to keep the polyps free of diggerworms. when they were not working, jost played with the other children in the village, including his brother jest, tift, mord, naget, and khav. jost and the other children were bitter that kaladin was able able to stay inside during the day, not realizing that he worked hard at his studies all day long. in 1166, he got into an altercation with kaladin. kaladin inadvertently made several comments that antagonized jost, and laral further agitated the situation. jost claimed that his father should have been awarded a shardblade after killing a shardbearer in the wastescum skirmishes, but someone else took the blade while he was unconscious. kaladin suggested that jost's father could not have possibly won a shardblade in the fighting since the reshi people were not known to have blades. jost took this as kaladin calling his father a liar, and he challenged kaladin to a fight with wooden staves. despite the fact that jost had trained in the staff and kaladin had never wielded a weapon before, kaladin landed several blows and only lost the fight because he hesitated to hurt jost. this was the first time that kaladin realized how much he enjoyed using a weapon, and he asked jost to train him further. jost admitted that kaladin had done well, but declined to train him, saying that lirin would not allow it and that kaladin should go be a surgeon. the memory of the fight and the excitement that he felt while wielding the staff stuck with kaladin. jost, abry, and several other youths from hearthstone volunteered for amaram's army in 1168. jost was sixteen or seventeen years old at the time; his mother did not want him to leave, as she needed his help with the crops. notes[edit]"
Miliv,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Miliv,"miliv was citylord wistiow's head steward in hearthstone on roshar. miliv disliked lirin, the local surgeon from hearthstone, for unknown reasons. lirin's son, kaladin, believed that many of the rumors about their family in hearthstone were started by miliv. miliv was married to a woman who worked as a nurse to brightlady laral wistiow. after laral's father died, the nurse didn't let kaladin visit laral because she believed that the boys from the town were inappropriate friends for laral. sometime after citylord roshone arrived to replace wistiow, miliv died and was replaced as steward by natir. notes[edit]"
Takama,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Takama,"takamas are traditional warrior garments from alethkar on roshar. description[edit] a takama is a long, straight, calf-length skirt. they are usually loose-fitting and tied tightly with a long belt, typically in two knots with the ends hanging loosely. takamas can be made from fine materials and it is not unusual to see them in a formal setting; they are sometimes golden in color. the takama has some similarities to both the pleated vakama and the shorter ulatu from jah keved. during the heraldic epochs, takamas were worn with wide girdles and no shirt; vaiu, an honorspren in shadesmar, favors a similar style. in dalinar kholin's youth, it was common for soldiers to wear long uniform jackets over their takamas. in current-day roshar, the skirt is traditionally worn with a light, loose-fitting overshirt and a cloth belt. the shirts are specifically designed to be worn with a takama. history[edit] takamas are ancient in origin, dating to at least the heraldic epochs; dalinar observed people wearing takamas of an older style during one of his visions of the time of nohadon. takamas were popular as warriors garb as recently as a generation prior to the war of reckoning, but were rarely worn in modern roshar. kaladin, who grew up in rural alethkar, first saw a takama when he was twelve or thirteen years old and was surprised at its resemblance to a woman's skirt. dalinar often wore a takama in his youth and told kadash a story about one of his swordmasters, harth, teaching him to tie a takama in the ""traditional"" way, with the belt tied three times. he noticed that everyone else tied the belt twice, leaving the ends long and drooping. dalinar sought out harth's master to ask him about it, and realized that the master tied his belt three times not because of tradition, but because he was extremely short in stature and the long ends made him trip. perhaps because of this embarrassment, dalinar never liked wearing a takama, although he did wear them during his time as the blackthorn. most of the people seen wearing a takama in modern roshar are members of the nobility or the military. they include roshone, sebarial, and elhokar. amaram, a noted traditionalist, required his soldiers to wear a takama as part of their uniform. aladar took to wearing a shorter, modern-cut uniform jacket over his takama and the style caught on with his officers. notes[edit]"

Rose Empire,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Arbiter,"the rose empire is a nation on sel. it is on the same continent as teod, but separated from it by mountains. the rose empire is ruled by the emperor of eighty suns, who sits on the rose throne. the reigning emperor during the time of shai's imprisonment was emperor ashravan, the 49th emperor of the imperial dynasty. the lifespan of rose empire's dynasty is thus estimated to be within the range of 1000 to 3500 years at that point, given the lifespan of a grand. the rose empire maintains trade with the states of sycla, but have a more strained relationship with svorden. svorden had sent a table as a gift to emperor ashravan's predecessor, but the poor relationship with svorden caused the emperor to lock it away. they know of the concept of mass production, and used it in collusion with remembering to create complex works in quantity. the empire seems to use a caste system in which citizens attain ranks known as ""reeds"" that have certain requirements and privileges. factions[edit] there are eighty different factions in the rose empire's government. the number is presumed to relate to the fact that citizens of the rose empire believe that there are eighty suns and that a new one rises each day. each faction is led by a group of five arbiters, who as a whole determine the line of succession of emperors. upon the death of an emperor, the arbiters gather and elevate the candidate of an agreed upon faction to the position of emperor. the arbiters of the faction of the emperor occupy positions of great power in the government. only grands may become arbiters. customarily they wear long, colorful robes to denote their position, and each arbiter has a symbol that is used by their assigned servants. the arbiters of the emperor's faction are known as the ruling arbiters and they possess considerable power and influence over the rose empire, only superseded by the emperor himself. prisoners sentenced to death are allowed to call for arbiter intervention, if their case is granted a review by the ruling arbiters. if the emperor goes into mourning the ruling arbiters are the only people allowed to speak with him. as a result, in such circumstances the arbiters essentially have unilateral control over the entire rose empire. sub-states[edit] notes[edit]"

Harth,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Harth,"harth is a swordsman from alethkar on roshar. he was dalinar kholin's first sword trainer. dalinar's father hired harth to train a young dalinar in swordsmanship. the kholin family was not particularly powerful at the time, and had to settle for harth even though he was young and not recognized as a true swordmaster. he came from ""a few towns over"" to train dalinar. dalinar believes that harth had a reasonable level of skill for someone of his standing. dalinar tells kadash a tale of harth insisting that he tie his takama in a specific way, the same way that harth's master and his master's master had always demanded. dalinar seeks out the originator of this rule, an old ardent in kholinar, and realizes that he only tied it that way because he was so short. dalinar uses this tale to argue that blindly following tradition does not make it worthy. ""“tradition? kadash, did i ever tell you about my first sword trainer?back when i was young, our branch of the kholin family didn't have grand monasteries and beautiful practice grounds. my father found a teacher for me from two towns over. his name was harth. young fellow, not a true swordmaster -- but good enough. he was very focused on proper procedure, and wouldn't let me train until i'd learned how to put on a takama the right way. he wouldn't have stood for me fighting like this. you put on the skirt, then the overshirt, then you wrap your cloth belt around yourself three times and tie it. i always found that annoying. the belt was too tight, wrapped three times -- you had to pull it hard to get enough slack to tie the knot. the first time i went to duels at a neighboring town, i felt like an idiot. everyone else had long drooping belt ends at the front of their takamas. i asked harth why we did it differently. he said it was the right way, the true way. so, when my travels took me to harth's hometown, i searched out his master, a man who had trained with the ardents in kholinar. he insisted that this was the right way to tie a takama, as he'd learned from his master. i found my master's master's master in kholinar after we captured it. the ancient, wizened ardent was eating curry and flatbread, completely uncaring of who ruled the city. i asked him. why tie your belt three times, when everyone else thinks you should do it twice? the old man laughed and stood up. i was shocked to see that he was terribly short. 'if i only tie it twice,' he exclaimed, 'the ends hang down so low, i trip!' i love tradition, i've fought for tradition. i make my men follow the codes. i uphold vorin virtues. but merely being tradition does not make something worthy, kadash. we can't just assume that because something is old it is right. ”-dalinar's monologue"" notes[edit]"

""“a hardened soldier who had encountered something so vile that even he was shaken. he'd left to become an ardent the next day.”-kadash at the rift"" after all ten princedoms of alethkar had been conquered, kadash was part of the army's new campaign to secure the northern lands of alethkar. they defeated the herdazians and claimed the reshi isle of akak, which took four years, then proceeded to engage the vedens further southwards. this eventually led to the battle at rathalas. once the walls of the city had been captured, dalinar ordered kadash and fifty of his elites to enter the city and soak the lower parts of the rift with oil before igniting the entire city with burning arrows. while the elites held down tanalan, the commander of the enemy forces, kadash himself was just standing at the side of the city, looking down at the destruction. he was traumatized by the experience and left the army the next day. joining the ardentia (1163 - 1173)[edit] after many years in the military, kadash changed his calling, ending his career as a soldier and joining the ardentia. kadash also rose high within the ranks of the ardents, becoming the overseer of the soulcasters as one of the ardents owned by highprince dalinar kholin and his family. he served dalinar loyally for many years and trained and tutored his son adolin during his childhood. after szeth-son-son-vallano's assassination of king gavilar kholin, kadash spoke to some of gavilar's surviving guards, but he believed their mentions of szeth's surgebinding to be the result of shock and trauma. service on the shattered plains (1173)[edit] ""“i still find it incredible. even after all these years. if we needed proof of the almighty's hand in our lives, this is certainly it. ”-kadash on soulcasting"" kadash accompanied dalinar kholin and his armies to the shattered plains to provide religious instruction while the war of reckoning was fought. he worked in the main vorin temple in dalinar's warcamp, where adolin and janala lustow visited him in 1173. kadash was concerned that adolin had not made much progress with his calling, but adolin wished to speak to kadash about dalinar's visions and his growing concerns about dalinar's sanity. the two spoke in private on the temple's central mound. adolin told kadash of dalinar's visions and asked kadash if they could really be coming from the almighty or if he was simply losing his mind. kadash was unwilling to give a direct answer due to his loyalty to dalinar, but he spoke about the hierocracy, explaining that the priests then had spoken of visions, which the sunmaker later discovered to be a fabrication. kadash said that he felt that it was unlikely that the visions would come from the almighty; he implied that dalinar might be haunted by his experiences on the battlefield but stopped short of actually saying that dalinar was mad. kadash told adolin that he was the only one that could help his father and asked that adolin return soon to discuss his calling. later that year, kadash proposed to dalinar that they could soulcast large blocks of stone for windbreaks on the eastern side of dalinar's camp to allow it to expand onto the shattered plains. after debating the idea for several months, dalinar agreed to the plan. kadash accompanied the soulcasters to the edge of dalinar's warcamp to perform the soulcasting. the soulcasters had such a demand on their time that kadash had taken them out during the day to soulcast concealed within an enclosed silk canopy. adolin had seen them from a distance, and came to speak to kadash. he confided in kadash that szeth had attempted to assassinate dalinar and made use of the powers of the radiants. kadash was shocked at this and disturbed by the idea that the radiants could be returning. he agreed to do research into their abilities for adolin so he could be better equipped to combat szeth if he should return. service in urithiru (1174 - 1175)[edit] after the battle of narak, kadash moved to urithiru. he came into conflict with dalinar, however, who had begun saying publicly that the almighty was dead. he refused to marry dalinar and navani because the vorin church saw them as siblings and even approached the other ardents on chanada's suggestion to ask them to refuse as well. when they eventually married through the stormfather, kadash attended the ceremony, though he was disappointed and afraid of what the ardentia might do to dalinar. ""“unity. if that is your goal, dalinar, then why do you seek to rip apart your own people?”-kadash to dalinar"" when dalinar visited a training room for soldiers and had a wrestling match with aratin khal, kadash went there to check up on dalinar but got challenged to a duel instead. kadash declined at first, but accepted the challenge of his highprince and former comrade-in-arms anyway. even in a solo duel, kadash still had the instincts of a soldier, keeping watch on his sides. while they were sparring, dalinar simultaneously held a spanreed meeting with the iriali queen and a conversation about his beliefs with kadash. kadash demanded that dalinar recant his blasphemy regarding his position on the church, but dalinar refused to shy away from what he saw as the truth. kadash eventually lost the match to an invalid dueling strike. later, kadash joined king elhokar kholin, dalinar, and navani on a trip to the alethi warcamps. they traveled to shattered plains via the oathgate, then were flown to the warcamps by kaladin and his windrunners. once they arrived, kadash visited his office in the camp monastery where he had kept most of his books and spanreeds in a wall safe, as he hadn't had time to pack his belongings when the warcamps were left in haste for urithiru ten weeks prior. these five spanreeds were linked to the leaders of vorinism in jah keved, herdaz, kharbranth, thaylenah and new natanan, and all had been trying to contact kadash with questions related to the desolation, yet he did not answer them until scholars from the palanaeum had finished sending him passages recently translated from the dawnchant. when he admitted this to dalinar, dalinar realized that kadash knew he wasn't mad. kadash helped dalinar to find the room in which taln had been kept, though he didn't accompany him. one of kadash's projects in urithiru was an attempt to farm on the tower's garden balconies. the plants would not grow, however, either because of the cold or the fact that few storms reached high enough. he was working on this project one day when dalinar, whose memories had finally returned, came to apologize to him and talk about his actions at rathalas. kadash convinced him that it was the wrong move to give his ardents over to taravangian and pleaded that dalinar would just release a statement that would allow the vorin church to move on. during the battle of thaylen field, kadash found himself in thaylen city. he was with other scribes and ardents in a building near the city's oathgate and operated a spanreed to sebarial's scribes back in urithiru. kadash relayed news of the attack in urithiru and confirmed that the forces there were unlikely to be able to break through and use the oathgate to come reinforce the troops in thaylen city. relationships[edit] dalinar kholin[edit] ""“he's frightened that he’s somehow failed in his most solemn duty to a man he deeply admires.”-kadash speaking of himself"" kadash and dalinar have known each other for years. they are comrades-in-arms during dalinar's conquests to unite alethkar, as kadash is one of the highest ranking officers among dalinar's elites, but they aren't particularly close at the time. kadash is a hardened soldier, but even after all he has been through he is horrified by the destruction of rathalas ordered by his highprince. he leaves the army and becomes an ardent the next day, though he remains loyal to dalinar. years later, dalinar starts having visions from the stormfather in which it is revealed to him that the almighty is dead. kadash is skeptical because vorinism considers those claims to be heresy, but out of respect for dalinar, the ardent doesn't discard the possibility right away and makes an effort to gather all the facts. he still considers dalinar his friend but is pained that by the things that he says. he consents to attend dalinar and navani's wedding even though he disapproves. kadash and dalinar argue every time they see each other, dalinar trying to get kadash to see the truth that he sees and kadash trying to get dalinar to let things be so that the vorin church and dalinar's ardents can move on. however, dalinar sees kadash's innate honesty and feels that he will eventually get through to him. notes[edit]"

Naget,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Naget,"naget is a resident of hearthstone in alethkar on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] he is darkeyed and has light hair. he is spindly, and is the tallest among his peers as a youth. kaladin cites 'naget' as an example of a 'solid, alethi darkeyes' name, unlike his own. naget is quite curious about whether a darkeyed person can really become lighteyed by winning a shardblade. history[edit] naget comes from a farming family and was often tasked with removing diggerworms from the lavis fields near the town. he was among the group of youths who observed kaladin picking up a weapon for the first time to fight jost. a few years later, he was present when amaram came to hearthstone to recruit soldiers for his army. he was no longer friendly with kaladin at that point. he did not volunteer to join the army, and avoided conscription. notes[edit]"
Havah,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Havah,"a havah is a traditional vorin dress on roshar. it is formfitting through the bust, shoulders, and waist, and has a flowing skirt. it is buttoned up the sides, and the left sleeve is longer than the other in order to fully cover the safehand. said sleeve can also contain a pouch, known as a safepouch, that can be used for storing valuable spheres or other small personal items. they are often made of silk in bright colors. cut[edit] ""“the cut of a havah is similar to a cheongsam, with full sleeves and falling from the hips. beneath the slitted outer skirt are many thin layers like fine silk which interweave to create a sort of accordion effect. this would (i think?) allow the dress to fall at a sharp angle from the hip when still, while expanding to allow a full range of leg movement. the buttons run from the throat down to the waist, following a line from the jaw down to the collarbone, curving out to follow the bust and then down the line of the torso. i don't think there's a rule for the number of buttons, but when in doubt remember that ""10"" is significant to the culture. frog buttons are legit, i think. ”-ben mcsweeney on havah's cut"" embroidery[edit] ""“alethi's don't do the flower thing as much... it's not really an alethi thing, floral patterns. so you are seeing a lot of designs and hatchings. they may look a little arabic to you. or the glyphs and things like that you will see worked in but very stylized. ”-brandon sanderson on embroidery"" replacement hem[edit] the replaceable hem would be a continuous piece attached to the underskirt. this hem piece is not easy to change, so it is probably sewn on and not attached with buttons or some other simple fastener. it is a simple enough operation that it is done with relative frequency, however. due to the difficulty in finding fabric that is an exact match for something bought another time or place, people often purchase replacement hems in contrasting colors. images[edit] - images of havahs bridal gowns[edit] ""“her sapphire gown was of an ancient style, with twin drooping sleeves that went far beyond her hands. small rubies woven into the embroidery glowed with a complementary light. a golden vest draped over the shoulders, matched by the ornate headdress woven into her braids. ”-shallan davar's bridal gown"" the vorin wedding gown is a variation of a havah. it is likely an older version of what is now accepted as the traditional havah design. two vorin wedding gowns have been described: the red light from the rubies' stormlight brings the ""red for luck"" to shallan's gown. using blue for shallan's wedding gown indicates that vorin brides are allowed more than one color option in a traditional wedding dress. ""“red, for luck, it was embroidered with gold and shaped much looser style than the havah, with wide sleeves and a graceful drape.”-navani kholin's bridal gown"" a bridal crown typically accompanies the wedding gown, and is worn by the bride as a headpiece for the wedding ceremonies in the vorin tradition. hair is worn braided for the occasion. the pieces are secured to the hair. currently only two descriptions are available: neither jade nor turquoise is associated with soulcasting. they are not polestones, which are capable of naturally holding stormlight. trivia[edit] - the vorin bridal dress is likely inspired by traditional chinese wedding gowns, which are often much looser in cut than a qipao or - - the more fitted traditional dresses. the wedding gowns are often covered in gold embroidery with designs that are meant to represent luck and other blessings for the couple. - the vorin bridal crown is likely inspired by the - , or phoenix crowns, worn by brides in traditional chinese wedding ceremonies. jade and turquoise are both associated with luck in many earth cultures, including in china and tibet. notes[edit]"

Takers,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Takers,"the takers were a squad of soldiers in amaram's army lead by tukks on roshar that kaladin was a member of. the squad was composed of darkeyes, and fought using spears. outside of battle, they also trained new soldiers, both with spear and with quarterstaff. their training methods included corporal punishment. it was kaladin's first unit upon joining, and it was there that he refined his talent with the spear into proper skill. at some point, either most or all of them died, and kaladin was transferred elsewhere, perhaps straight to leading his own squad. notes[edit]"
Jaks,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Earless_Jaks,"earless jaks was a member of bridge four on roshar. he was killed during the battle of the tower. appearance and personality[edit] like many of the other bridge four members, earless jaks did not take kindly to kaladin’s leadership at first, and was openly hostile towards him. he gained respect for kaladin over time, becoming a willing part of the team. attributes and abilities[edit] jaks had some level of artistic ability, as he was chosen to paint designs on carapace armor designed by leyten. history[edit] it is not known how jaks became a bridgeman or how he lost his ears-in fact, it is not clear if he was actually earless, or if it was just a nickname. when kaladin got the squad assigned to stone gathering duty (while secretly gathering knobweed sap), earless jaks approached him with dunny, towing a wooden sled bearing a large stone. as they loaded the boulder into the wagon, earless jaks scowled at kaladin. when kaladin complimented him, earless jaks just glared at him and stalked off. his contempt for kaladin continued during chasm duty, joining in when sigzil and moash gibed the bridgeleader. ""“he cares about looking important. even if he was in the army, i’ll bet he spent his days cleaning out latrines. ”-earless jaks taunting kaladin during chasm duty"" after kaladin performed an advanced kata, earless jaks was presumably among the bridgemen who gained a newfound respect for kaladin. he questioned kaladin's plan to escape the warcamps, but was presumably among the bridgemen who agreed to learn how to fight after realizing that there was no good alternative. after bridge four secured parshendi carapaces and leyten fashioned armor from them, earless jaks purchased blue and white paint and drew designs on the new armor. jaks died in the battle of the tower alongside malop and narm. kaladin lamented that he couldn’t save the three of them, although he tried his best to focus on the fact that the others had survived. kaladin remembered him along with malop, beld, pedin, rod, mart, goshel, nalma, dallet and the squad, and tien while trying, and failing, to say the fourth ideal of the windrunners. kaladin remembered failing jaks and other members of bridge four when moash confronted him in toralin roshone's manor. trivia[edit] - some early versions of - had a typo that spelled his name as ""earless jacks"". notes[edit]"
Caelinora,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Caelinora,"caelinora is an honorspren on roshar. she is bonded to huio. attributes and abilities[edit] as an honorspren, caelinora presumably has the inherent abilities of her species, including flight and shapeshifting. she can initiate a nahel bond, which allows her to transition to the physical realm and makes her bonded partner a windrunner. history[edit] caelinora likely bonded huio after the battle of thaylen field, as huio had only recently become a radiant squire at that point. huio and caelinora were selected to join the expedition to akinah in late 1174. by that time, huio had sworn the first two ideals of the windrunners. although caelinora rarely appeared to lopen, she was visible to cord since she was one of the sighted. huio swore the third ideal during the hordeling battle on the shores of akinah, advancing his bond with caelinora; this surprised lopen, who was happy for the pair but a bit envious at first. huio wielded caelinora as a massive living shardhammer that could instantly transform into a shardspear at his command. notes[edit]"
Turlm,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Turlm,"turlm is a thaylen sailor and a member of the crew of the wandersail. appearance and personality[edit] turlm has a genial personality and always shares his booze. lopen considers him a friend, despite his tendency to eat with his mouth open. attributes and abilities[edit] he hails from thaylen city, and is a father to six daughters there. he is a competent sailor. history[edit] turlm was a member of the expedition to akinah. as the wandersail neared akinah and breached the storm surrounding the island, he was swept overboard by an unexpected wave that washed over the deck. he was quickly saved by lopen and rua, and was amazed and very grateful. fimkn then sent him belowdecks for the remainder of the passage through the storm. notes[edit]"
Plamry,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Plamry,"plamry is a thaylen man on roshar that worked with nikli as a porter to rysn. history[edit] plamry did not seem to be present when nikli first appeared in urithiru and was presumably hired to serve as nikli's assistant porter shortly before the wandersail departed on the expedition to akinah in 1174. when nikli was discovered by rysn to have been working against the voyage, plamry was also under suspicion and taken captive by kstled. despite nikli's insistence that plamry was not aware of its plan, lopen and huio flew both of them to the main island of aimia, chained them up, and left them with food and water, so that the wandersail could continue its mission. plamry was indeed ignorant of nikli's true goals and its nature as a sleepless. nikli presumably used its abilities to escape from aimia, and plamry's mental state after seeing hordelings in action is unclear. he was recovered from aimia after the mission to explore akinah had been completed. notes[edit]"
Nikliasorm,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Nikli,"nikliasorm, also known as nikli, is a dysian aimian living on roshar. it is at least 400 years old, though it is young for its species. appearance and personality[edit] while in its human form, nikli takes on the appearance of a makabaki man with white tattoos on its face and arms to cover the spaces between its hordelings. attributes and abilities[edit] nikli is known among all the sleepless swarms as being the most skilled at impersonating humans. it is one of the few sleepless that has eye hordelings that are actually functional. this allows it to more realistically imitate humans than other sleepless, who use prop eyes, since its sight lines actually line up with its eyes. history[edit] nikli is the youngest of the dysian aimians currently on roshar. it was the twenty fourth swarm to separate, only doing so after the scouring. after the discovery of the first dreams, nikli was sent by the sleepless who guarded akinah to be rysn's personal servant so it could ensure that the ancient guardian was being cared for. additionally, since they suspected that she might soon travel to aimia, nikli was instructed to attempt to stop her from reaching the island. initially, nikli would overzealously try to assist rysn in everything she did, but it soon realized that she preferred being independant and doing things herself. when rysn arrived at urithiru nikli told the master-servant who greeted them that she preferred using her own chair but rysn corrected it, saying that the porters knew the city better than she did, and had nikli bring the chair in case she needed it later. at some point between their trip to urithiru and departing on the journey to aimia nikli hired an assistant, plamry, to help it perform its duties. nikli and plamry carried rysn and her baggage aboard the wandersail and carried her around the ship as she required it. sometime before they departed, nikli poisoned screech, the wandersail's skyeel mascot, in an attempt to frighten the crew so they would abort their mission. after nikli put rysn in her new chair on the quarterdeck, it told her that it thought that the captain and the crew did not trust her. nikli tried to suggest that they delay the trip so they could find a more suitable crew, but rysn brushed its concerns aside, saying that they were good men chosen by vstim and they had been training with the ship since it was built. when rysn found out that screech had died she told the crew that anyone who wanted could stay behind without penalty, placating the crew and foiling nikli's plot. after rysn found out why drlwan resented her so much she had a philosophical discussion with nikli about how sometimes you had to accept an imperfect solution for an imperfect world. kstled returned to them and reported that although the ship's cook, nlan, was among the sailors who accepted her offer, cord would be able to take her place. this put another kink into nikli's plans, and they set sail. nikli decided to try and play off the thaylen sailors' immense superstition by causing supposedly random events of misfortune to happen to the crew. the first attempt of this was to put worms in the ship's stores of grain; however, rysn was able to avert disaster by trading it with a group of hexi nomads. nikli then went to a secluded corner of the ship in order to report to the other sleepless, and pleaded to be allowed one final chance to turn away the voyage before having to kill them all. this took the form of a group of hordelings imitating a santhid's corpse. rysn, though, was again able to prevent the sailors' aborting the mission by suggesting that they go ashore and burn the santhid's corpse to give it a proper send-off; however, nikli sent its hordelings swimming away before they could do so. the next day, nikli tried to frame cord for the murder of screech and the other omens, but, as rysn had searched cord's room herself beforehand, it became clear that its evidence was fabricated. kstled restrained it, and once it was certain that it had been found out, it dropped its accent and told kstled that nothing he could do to it would hurt it, and lopen and huio then removed it from the ship. however, once everyone but cord and rysn had begun the exploration of aimia, nikli rematerialized on deck from its hordelings. it made clear that it intended to kill all of the voyagers, a declaration to which cord replied by grabbing rysn and diving overboard, following a trail of luckspren into an underwater cavern. nikli, along with two other sleepless, followed them to the cavern, but too late to fulfill their intent--rysn had looked at the mural in the cavern and become a dawnshard. though they still intended to kill her, she put her training with vstim to good use and opened negotiations with them. in the end, nikli agreed that rysn would live and could let cord keep the sets of shards found in the cavern, and in exchange, rysn would protect the dawnshard when cosmere forces eventually came looking for it, and would never bond a spren or become invested in any other way, so as to prevent a catastrophe such as what happened on ashyn. the sleepless would also be allowed to follow rysn at all times to ensure that she was keeping her side of the bargain. though the existence of the sleepless would be shared with the world, a two-layer cover story would be created--the first being that the appearance of chiri-chiri caused the sleepless to let them go, and queens navani, jasnah, and fen would be told that the sleepless would be learning from rysn how to imitate humankind. none of them would be told the existence of the dawnshard, however. relationships[edit] the sleepless[edit] nikli is regarded by the sleepless, particularly yelamaiszin, as a valuable perspective, despite its youth, because of its greater understanding of humans. notes[edit]"

Sebarial princedom,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sebarial_princedom,"sebarial princedom is one of ten alethi princedoms in alethkar on roshar. the house colors are deep gold & black. the highprince is turinad sebarial and his banner consists of the glyphs sebes and laial in the shape of a skyeel. geography[edit] sebarial princedom is located in the south of alethkar, bordered to the north by thanadal, to the west by hatham and bethab, to the east by the sea of spears and the eastern crownlands, and to the south by the frostlands. the city of rashir is located near the western border with bethab. the deathbend river flows through the princedom and its tributaries appear to define parts of the eastern border. history[edit] the princedom was founded by one of the ten sons of sadees the sunmaker, who split up alethkar after his death. warcamp[edit] like the other princedoms, sebarial contructs a large warcamp at the shattered plains during the war of reckoning. highprince sebarial focuses on commerce rather than battle, and his warcamp is notably more advanced than the other camps. it has running water, shops, taverns, well-engineered housing, farms, twelve factories making various goods and supplies, and an information station with scribes and spanreeds, including at least one connected to tashikk. the camp's gates are open all night. kaladin thought sebarial's camp looked more like a city than the other camps. little herdaz is inside the warcamp, and a number of herdazians live there even if they are not from sebarial princedom. lopen and other herdazians disguise elhokar and bring him into little herdaz to recover after an assassination attempt by moash. manor[edit] sebarial and his herdazian mistress palona live in a manor in the camp. although not as large as manors in alethi cities, it is far more elaborate than other buildings in the warcamps. the house's exterior has classical columns and is situated behind taller buildings to avoid wind damage. the gardens have ornamental shalebark, trees, and a flagstone driveway. the interior is mostly white stone with marble, crystal, glass windows, and gold-trimmed statues. there are numerous maids and footmen. when shallan arrives at the shattered plains, she invites herself into highprince sebarial's entourage. she moves into the manor and is surprised by the level of affluence displayed by sebarial. her guest quarters are white stone, with a sitting room and rich furnishings. move to urithiru[edit] sebarial is one of the few highprinces that sends his armies to join dalinar's assault on the parshendi that results in the battle of narak. this gains him a measure of respect with dalinar, who names sebarial the highprince of commerce in urithiru. sebarial is given a section of urithiru and relocates most of the people in his warcamp to the city. some operations remain at the warcamp due to the need for agriculture and lumber, although sebarial thinks this is not sustainable and expresses concern about thanadal taking over the camps. most of sebarial's soldiers end up joining the kholin army. shallan decides to live in sebarial's section of urithiru, and notes that it stays busier than the rest of the city, much like his warcamp. notes[edit]"
Sunmaker Mountains,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sunmaker_Mountains,"the sunmaker mountains are a mountain range in alethkar. the range cuts across central alethkar, adjacent to the princedoms of kholin, ruthar, aladar, thanadal and hatham. they are named after the sunmaker, an alethi king that united the highprinces and helped to overthrow the hierocracy. in the cognitive realm, the reflection of the sunmaker mountains is a body of water called the salavashi trench. it is possible that some of the peaks in the sunmaker mountains are above the top of the highstorms. koron accents come from a place near the sunmaker mountains, in central alethkar. notes[edit]"
Sadees,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sadees,"""“ all wars are games. the greatest kind, with the pieces lost real lives, the prizes captured making for real wealth! this is the life for which men exist. to fight, to kill, to win. ”- the sunmaker"" sadees, also known as the sunmaker, is an ancient king of alethkar on roshar who reigned about five hundred years before the true desolation, and was the first to unify the kingdom after the fall of alethela. appearance and personality[edit] little of the sunmaker's personality is known. he is an ambitious man, constantly going above and beyond on tasks others thought impossible. he is a lover of battle and considers it to be a great game. there is a streak of cruelty to his conquests, with sadees killing thousands to achieve his dream of a unified roshar. he is insane and has a tendency to kill even ordinary citizens in his conquest, such as in the genocide he instituted against the azish people. he has little tolerance for other cultures, claiming that the azish were uncivilized since they did not use eye color as a basis for their social hierarchy. nothing is known of the sunmaker's physical appearance, beyond the fact that he refused to wear a crown. the man wielded a hooked shardblade known as oathbringer. history[edit] early life and defeat of the hierocracy[edit] little is known of sadees's early life. at some point in his life, the sunmaker bonded the shardblade known as oathbringer. at age seventeen, he began his campaign to unite the highprinces of alethkar into a single nation. sadees used two tactics to help achieve his aim. he made use of an entire company of cavalry, with legendary speed and maneuverability. the thrill also drove his soldiers to victory. after completing this task and claiming a mandate from the almighty, sadees crowned himself king of a united alethkar. the sunmaker led the overthrow of the hierocracy. he questioned the ardents about their claims of prophecies from the almighty, going through their correspondence. the sunmaker proclaimed that the ardents had been lying, so vorinism was broken into devotaries. later conquests and death[edit] with the hierocracy defeated, the sunmaker turned his attention to a conquest of all of roshar. he began with a conquest of herdaz, which he successfully completed. however, this was not enough for him, and he turned his attention west. it is uncertain whether he conquered jah keved, or if that kingdom even existed at that point. what is known is that he conquered his way to azir in western roshar, then under the rule of prime aqasix snoxil. upon reaching azir, the sunmaker claimed that as the azish did not properly respect eye color they needed to be conquered and civilized. he sacked the capital of azimir and took the kingdom easily, more easily than he had assumed. unable to leave a city behind with a force of fighting men, sadees instituted a policy of genocide against the azish. he issued arbitrary decrees, such as ordering all men with hair beyond a certain length be executed. other times he ordered each of his soldiers to kill a specific number of captives each day. it is said that the highstorms blew up piles of skulls in zawfix. during his time in azir, sadees had one in ten people in azir killed. as his conquest continued, sadees suddenly fell ill with an unknown disease and died. legacy[edit] upon the sunmaker's death, his empire did not last long. he had never bothered to choose an heir, and his ten sons could not decide among themselves who they wished to support. his sons quickly turned to infighting and the empire collapsed in less than a generation. these ten sons founded the princedoms in alethkar, crowning themselves the highprinces of a disunified kingdom. as the kingdom turned insular, their influence beyond their own borders decreased greatly. however, the sunmaker's conquests had a lasting impact on alethkar. his campaign forged the modern trade routes between alethkar and azir, herdaz, and jah keved. his contact with other kingdoms brought science and culture back to alethkar. this influx of contact with the outside world triggered an alethi cultural revolution. his defeat of the hierocracy and the division of the vorin church into devotaries prevented the ardents from gaining the same amount of power or wealth they once enjoyed. in modern alethkar, sadees is revered as a cultural hero. to be compared to the sunmaker is considered to be a great compliment. the sunmaker mountains in central alethkar were named after him. king gavilar kholin revered the sunmaker. he was gavilar's inspiration when gavilar united the highprinces himself. in fact one of the titles of the refounded king of alethkar is heir of the sunmaker. when dalinar kholin was determined to forge a coalition against the voidbringers, he tried to avoid using conquest as a tool, as he considered the sunmaker to be a tyrant and wished to do better. memories of the sunmaker made the other nations of roshar hesitant to trust dalinar and the alethi. trivia[edit] - sadees is the rosharan equivalent of a persona such as - or - . notes[edit]"

Vorinism,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Devotaries,"vorinism is one of the primary religions of roshar. it is most prevalent in alethkar, jah keved, kharbranth, new natanan and thaylenah, collectively known as the vorin kingdoms, and becomes less common further west. the religion worships the almighty, a deity based on honor, and the ten heralds. beliefs[edit] in vorin religion, people believe in the almighty, the force of good and creator of mankind. the glory of almighty is such that anyone looking upon him would immediately burn to ash. as such, he is typically represented by the divine prism with ten facets, one for each of the heralds. each herald is an emissary of the almighty, wielding potent magical powers, as well as the ability to respond to prayers and patronage over a specific part of human experience. vorinism typically places jezrien and kalak as the highest among the heralds, with others beneath them. occasionally, either of them are conflated with the stormfather, who in turn is commonly equated with the almighty himself, although this depends on the particular vorin country. creation myth[edit] the vorin creation story places mankind's origins at the tranquiline halls, a paradise from which they were forced off by the voidbringers, wicked creatures forged in damnation. the voidbringers possess terrible destructive power, and are regarded as the embodiment of evil. the voidbringers followed humanity to roshar trying to destroy it or force humanity off it and into damnation. mankind, led by the heralds and their chosen knights, fought them off ninety nine times in what are known as desolations. finally in aharietiam, the last desolation, the voidbringers were defeated and cast back into the tranquiline halls. the heralds followed to force them out of this heaven as well. on roshar, the knights radiant were left behind, although they ultimately betrayed humankind in the day of recreance. one explanation for the betrayal is that the knights radiant imitated great powers and pretended a holy calling using elaborate tricks and once this was discovered they fled. morality[edit] calling[edit] all vorins are expected to choose a calling, their greatest talent, and practice it until death. in the alethi variety of vorinism, fighting is considered the most important calling, as the almighty depends on alethi to join the heralds' army in their afterlife and win back the tranquiline halls. the ardents are supposed to help someone follow their calling, helping them to set goals for them to achieve in furtherance of it. when one furthers their calling enough, they elevate, one goes through multiple elevations in the pursuance of their calling. glory[edit] closely tied to the concept of a calling is glory. a glory is a particular attribute of the almighty that one is supposed to emulate in the pursuit of their calling. one typically choses their glory alongside their calling, as the two are supposed to work together; for example, the calling of a warrior and the glory of determination. it is seen that lighteyes have more innate glory than others, and that the purer their blood, the more they possess. known glories[edit] - determination - purity telling the future[edit] it is seen that telling the future is an utmost evil, inherently tied to voidbinding. due to this, vorins look down upon gambling and games of chance, seeing them as immoral and heretical.[citation needed] oaths and marriage[edit] when it comes to relationships, vorinism is focused on making and upholding oaths. breaking oaths, or acting without proper oaths, such as having sex outside of marriage, is frowned upon. however, vorinism offers a wide variety of partnership oaths for those who do wish to pursue relationships, including some for same-sex couples. life after death[edit] those who grow to be the very best at their calling are chosen to join the heralds in the fight to regain the tranquiline halls when they die. their particular afterlife differs depending on the calling -- those who were the very best at farming become farmers for the heralds, those who are the greatest at battle are chosen to fight beside the heralds, etc. depending on what your calling was in life, you would receive powers in the afterlife. a farmer would be able to cause whole fields of crops to grow with a single gesture, a spearman could create thunder with his shield and lightning from his spear. the heraldic forces were a believed to be the army of the heralds that fought the voidbringers for the tranquiline halls in what was called the war for heaven. it was said that the sound of a horn would call the heraldic forces to the field of battle. joining the heraldic forces was the considered to be highest calling of men. those who do not achieve their greatest potential are stuck in a dreamless sleep until the halls are reconquered, while those who do horrible things are cast into damnation. they appear to have some awareness of the spiritual realm, but conflate it with the afterlife. belief in symmetry[edit] symmetry is considered holy in vorinism. among others, glyphs are shaped symmetrically, silver kingdoms have perfectly symmetrical names, the heralds have symmetric names, and many people's names are close to symmetrical. however, people who have names that are actually symmetric are looked down on as ""too holy"" and therefore blasphemous. temples[edit] traditional vorin temples are circular and domed, with a sloping mound in the center. usually, the dome is exactly ten feet tall at its highest point. they are often filled with statues and pictures of the heralds. a major city is expected to have a separate temple for each herald. additionally, wealthy lighteye families will often have private chapels, and the ardentia maintains monasteries throughout the continent. such monasteries, like jokasha, are often seen as highly desirable postings, with many ardents working decades to get into one. prayer[edit] vorin pray through glyphwards, prayers written in glyphs, typically on a strip of paper, calling on the almighty and, sometimes, one or more of the heralds. they are typically burned to carry the soul of the prayer to the almighty. in higher classes of alethkar, much of the religious observation falls to the the priesthood, the ardentia, rather than the lighteyes themselves. the ardents in the employ of a lighteye are supposed to perform the required rituals for their master, so that the lighteyes do not have to worry about the spiritual aspect of their lives. oathgates[edit] the original purpose of the oathgates has been lost to time, though they are still considered sacred. in the present day, it's believed that the eleven lamps stand for the ten epoch kingdoms and the tranquiline halls, while the huge keyhole is ""the need for ardents to ignore borders, and look only at the hearts of men"". culture[edit] the vorin religion is closely interwoven with the culture of the vorin kingdoms, to the point where the same word is applied to both the faith and the culture. its modern form appears to be based on the book arts and majesty, outlining what is proper for men and women. women are expected to completely cover their left hand (called safehand in vorin vernacular) from the age of roughly eleven or twelve, as it is generally considered obscene. they are, however, permitted to learn how to read and write, and expected to manage a household and business. feminine arts include painting, reading, writing, and music. flutes are a commonly chosen instrument, however, it is rare for side-blown flutes to be found on roshar. more confrontational positions, such as politics and military, are considered masculine -- however, men are forbidden (or at least discouraged) from learning the alphabet. additionally, vorinism differentiates between feminine and masculine foods (sweet and spicy). those division between genders do not apply to ardents, who are considered genderless from cultural standpoint, and thus permitted to engage in both feminine and masculine activities. by tradition, every person can learn a trade at a vorin temple, including those of the opposite gender. in addition, the vorin religion justifies the cultural divide between the lighteyes and darkeyes, with the former being considered closer to the almighty and thus more holy, giving them power over the darkeyed masses. vorins are sometimes purposefully named after the heralds -- for example, shallan for shalash or kaladin for kalak. there is some crossover among different groups within vorinism, such as with essential theology, which is known to be used by ardents, scholars, and soulcasters, and is related to polestones. all official vorin betrothals must be signed and verified by ardents. as a result, people sometimes use a causal betrothal, which makes them practically engaged but confers no legal benefits. law[edit] apart from cultural and religious aspect, vorinism has an impact on the legal system, as the teachings of heralds demand implementation of certain laws. the right of travel[edit] ""“institute a right of movement, so that a family who feels their lord is unrighteous can leave his area. then tie a lord's authority to the people who follow him. ”-nale"" the right of travel allows every vorin citizen of sixth nahn or higher to freely travel between various vorin lands. vast majority of darkeyes have this right. lacking it ties a person to the land they were born in, and usually means that something has gone very badly for their ancestors. however, joining the military automatically forfeits the right of travel for the duration of service. the right of travel is derived from the heralds teaching that all borders should be open. more specifically, it was established by nale, as a way to protect the weak from abuses of power. it also serves as a form of addressing the power imbalance between lighteyes and darkeyes, as most darkeyes are able to leave a land that is poorly managed. the right to learn[edit] most people in vorin kingdoms have the right to learn professions in any temple of the almighty. larger vorin temples have at least one ardent who is an expert in any given art or trade, and they provide training to anyone who's interested, regardless of eye color. the right of challenge[edit] the right of challenge allows a distinguished lighteyed warrior to demand justice through combat from the one who wronged him. though the right is almost never used in the modern day, it can still be exercised, and is well-known among lighteyes. this right, however, does not extend to darkeyes, and a darkeye attempting to call on it can be punished with execution. priesthood[edit] the vorin priests are called ardents; the entirety of them is referred to as the ardentia. in matters of faith, they are led by a council of curates, operating out of the holy enclave in the veden city of valath. this council has the authority to excommunicate members of the church, including the leaders of vorin countries, for heresy -- a right given to them by the covenants of theocracy, an unspecified, but centuries-old document. they can be recognized by their blue robes, as well as gem-encrusted staves, far more ornate than is considered proper post-hierocracy. other types of ardents are likewise differentiated by the colors of their robes -- regular ones wear gray, while the soulcasters wear red. many ardents have shaved heads, and men often have long beards. both male and female ardents are considered genderless from the social standpoint: women do not need to cover their safehand, while men are allowed to learn to read and write, and both can eat both sweet and spicy foods. this being said, while they are technically allowed to pursue both masculine and feminine arts, they are often pushed to follow their gender. slavery[edit] ardents are, technically, slaves to lighteyed nobles of vorin countries, with some serving specific households while others are beholden to the national ruler. they can neither hold land nor own property -- a safeguard to prevent a second hierocracy. like parshmen and other slaves they are not paid for their work, but they are highly respected, even by people above them in the social hierarchy. it seems one cannot be forced to become an ardent; rather, people join willingly, and can also leave if they so choose. they believe that the limitations put upon them, and their state of slavery to high ranked political officials, is done by the almighty as so that they never rise above their stations. they believe that the highprinces that own them are chosen as the almighty's guardians of the people. spiritual guidance[edit] ardents are forbidden from participating in politics or holding social offices. however, their word and opinions are still highly valued, and they hold authority in spiritual matters. ardents are responsible for the spiritual well-beings of their masters, and often tend to various rites and rituals in their stead, so as to allow the lighteyes to go on with their lives unburdened. for the darkeyes, ardents provide advice in pursuing their calling, as well as education -- the right to learn means that any person who asks for it must be taught by the ardents. for this reason, most major temples have ardents specializing in most common skills, from fighting to writing. this also means that they are allowed to wield shardblades, as they must be capable of teaching the lighteyes how to use them. they are the only people allowed to speak almighty's tenth name, elithanathile, or he who transforms. however, it seems that this isn't considered to be too important of a rule, as navani kholin, a devout vorin, commonly uses it as an exclamation of shock or awe. soulcasting[edit] in alethkar, ardents are the only people allowed to use soulcasters. they surround the practice with mystery, carrying out soulcasting at night and under heavy guard to prevent the general public from seeing. they are, however, not allowed to use soulcasters on people. those among the ardentia who use soulcasters are often worked until they die of savanthood as their bodies become more and more like the things they soulcast. devotaries[edit] ardents are separated into devotaries, sects devoted to different aspects of vorinism. devotaries come in different forms: some, like the devotary of the mind, are monastic, sequestered away from civilization to devote themselves, while others permit their members to remain in touch with the rest of the world. this being said, ardents are generally not allowed to marry outside of their orders, though at least some orders allow them to marry each other. overall, their chief purpose is to aid in nurturing the believers' callings. known devotaries include: - is dedicated to wholesomeness and honesty. members of this devotary are expected to keep their thoughts and actions 'pure'. a member's talents are expected to be dedicated to purity as well, such as an artist depicting only religious topics. - - is a member of this devotary, by her father's choice. - is dedicated to seeking truth in all things. members believe that there is always something to learn, and everything is subject to scrutiny, even their own religion. no question is

desolations -- in fact, it might predate human arrival on roshar, as it was used even by the heralds themselves. the vorin religion came about around that time, basing itself on writings of a currently-unknown, but highly influential writer whom it was eventually named after. nohadon was another important figure during that time, and the way of kings he penned was one of vorinism's early holy texts. back in the early days of the religion, now called old vorinism, the knights radiant were an important part of the faith, and the first ideal was a religious doctrine. the primary tenet of the faith, as far as can be ascertained, was that how one lived was far more important than what one had accomplished. religion permeated every aspect of life, allowing the ardents to own land and property. hierocracy: rise[edit] following the recreance, the attitudes towards the knights radiant changed drastically, with them being seen as traitors rather than heroes. the focus shifted from the first ideal to other texts, chief among them arts and majesty, leading to the gender divide among the vorins that exists until the modern day. in spite of that, the lighteyes-darkeyes divide likely began during the same time, with pale eyes becoming the symbol of almighty's favor despite their previous association with radiance. as time went on, ardents took over more and more segments of society, claiming divine mandate to rule. ultimately, this led to priesthood holding near-absolute power over large swathes of land and populace as they sought to bring vorinism to the whole of roshar. the hierocracy, as it would come to be called, saw the ardentia go to great lengths to control its subjects through access to information. the priesthood claimed to have the sole authority to interpret the holy scriptures and the will of the almighty; the commoners were to follow them blindly as they were told what their callings were and what their god had planned from them. knowledge of the knights radiant was heavily censored, and what remained was altered and mythologized to fit the doctrine. yet even as surgebinding was discredited and deemed to be mere trickery, ardents themselves claimed to be able to predict the future through visions and prophecies. hierocracy: fall and aftermath[edit] as with many empires, hierocracy's greatest weakness was its sheer size. it grew larger with time, but so did the fractures within, and those fractures allowed alethi warlord sadees, later called the sunmaker, to make war on it. the resulting conflict, known as the war of loss, saw the ardentia fractured into devotaries, and the ardents themselves stripped of much of their power. no longer were they allowed to hold land or own property; no longer were they even free men. rather, they became slaves to lighteyes. moreover, as sadees conquered their strongholds, he interrogated them and their correspondence, and claimed to have learned that the so-called visions were little more than fabrications made to keep the people in check. this marked yet another shift in vorin doctrine: now, prophecy was an evil thing, of odium and the voidbringers, and to pursue it was heresy. yet more changes were made to free the church from ardentia's grip: rather than holding ultimate authority, they became merely advisors, and each man and woman was supposed to find the faith's meaning for themselves. present and future[edit] though sadees' war of conquest stretched as far west as azir, vorinism did not find foothold there. on the other hand, the states formerly under hierocracy, now known as the vorin kingdoms, retain the faith to this day. despite ardentia having few privileges remaining from the days of hierocracy, their social status has been slowly climbing back up over the past decades. the curates retain their right to excommunicate members of the church without consulting with any political authority, and though they are forbidden from amassing wealth, some of it still finds its way into their hands. in addition, ardents are increasingly often used as yet another political tool by the lighteyes. some people -- not only ardents, but even laymen -- seek the return of hierocracy, chief among them the sons of honor. other groups, like the envisagers, desire to go even further back, to the age of old vorinism. with the coming of the everstorm and the return of the knights radiant, the future of vorinism is unclear. many of its tenets, chief among them that the aharietiam was the final desolation, have been proven wrong, the heralds are quite mad, and the leaders of the largest anti-odium faction are a heretic and an atheist. for now, the church strives to retain control through hamfisted means -- most notably, the curates' sudden excommunication of dalinar kholin, who, at the time, had began to loudly proclaim almighty's death. this is unlikely to be sufficient, however, as there are some who believe that now is the time to break free from vorinism. notable members[edit] the ardentia[edit] - - an ardent who studies chemistry through cooking and lives on a small reshi island with geranid. - - scholar ardent

Bethab princedom,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Bethab_princedom,"bethab princedom is one of ten alethi princedoms that form alethkar. it has no house colors. geography[edit] it is located in the southwest of alethkar, and shares boarders with jah keved to the west, the frostlands to the south, the eastern crownlands to the east, sebarial princedom to the north-east, and hatham princedom to the north. it is the sole princedom with a connection to the southern depths, via mevan bay. locations[edit] history[edit] bethab princedom was one of the ten princedoms reunited into a single country under gavilar kholin. it is unknown whether highprince bethab fought for gavilar or against him during the war for unification. dalinar's forces stop in dumadari on their way to the shattered plains after the formation of the vengeance pact before sailing on to new natanan. dalinar used the voyage as a cover to travel to the valley and seek the nightwatcher. jasnah kholin was in residence in dumadari for an unknown amount of time in 1173. shallan davar travelled to the city to meet with the alethi princess, however, by the time she arrived jasnah had moved on. politics[edit] brightlord bethab is the current highprince of this princedom. he has, on several occasions, when negotiating business contracts with the king, included language that would favor him for succession of the throne. mishinah bethab, the highprince's wife, is also highly involved in alethi politics and will represent his interests on occasion. the bethab army is made up predominately of mercenary companies. it is implied that dumadari is not well protected from raids via mevan bay. residents[edit] - highprince notes[edit]"
Passions,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Passions,"""“don't know much blustering math...but i do know the passions. you win when you need it most, you see. ”-yalb"" the passions are a philosophy or religion from thaylenah on roshar. philosophy[edit] the primary tenet of the passions is that wanting something changes fate to draw it to you. if you need money very badly, you will win when you gamble, or if you strongly desire to visit a particular destination, you will get there even without a map. in a sense, passionate people make their own luck. the passions do not have a formal theology, yet some people treat them as a religion instead of a philosophy. belief in the passions is reinforced by the existence of spren on roshar, which often appear in response to emotions. ""“the men dream terrible dreams full of premonitions, and their dread passion creates omens.”-kstled"" followers of the passions often perceive unusual events as either good or bad omens, and these omens can have an enormous effect on the morale of thaylen sailors. an encounter with a santhid at sea is considered the best omen one could have, whereas the death of a ship's pet or food that goes rotten too quickly might be seen as bad omens. omens are believed to manifest as a result of the emotions of those who witness them. someone feeling a dread passion may have bad dreams full of premonitions at night, and witness omens during the day. the traditional way to disperse a bad omen is to derive a good turn from it, thus proving that fate is on your side. if you can win the internal struggle to be optimistic instead of gloomy, it will reflect in the world around you. although thaylens may speak of ""dark soulcasting"" and lore holds that the most passionate among them could reopen the ""portal of worlds"", the passions do not actually have any inherent magical component. relationship to shards[edit] the passions have their basis in traditions that were influenced by the shard odium. odium refers to himself as an incarnation of ""passion"" and many of his followers (such as the fused and moash) commonly speak of passion that comes from or honors odium. although the thaylen passions are not directly linked to odium, indirect connections through tradition and inspiration do exist. another shard named ruin that formerly inhabited scadrial also spoke pointedly about passion. this may have some significance in the cosmere, as not all of the shards share ruin and odium's regard for passion. practitioners[edit] although thaylenah is not considered a ""vorin kingdom"", vorinism is culturally dominant and there is an outpost of vorin leadership located there. thaylens are therefore nominally vorin, but many prominent thaylens (including yalb, yokska, and vstim) also follow the passions. febrth openly follows the passions despite his membership in the diagram. hobber follows the passions, although his ethnicity is not known. the crew of the wandersail maintained a strong belief in the power of omens, a fact that nikli leveraged to try and get them to abandon their journey to akinah. the passions seem to be culturally ingrained in most thaylens. queen fen and her husband kmakl both make reference to the passions despite the pressure for thaylen leadership to practice vorinism. rysn also maintains a belief in the passions, despite sometimes feeling skepticism about the philosophy. perception[edit] ""“but wishing and expecting is of the passions. a heresy. a good vorin worries about transforming themselves. ”-elhokar kholin"" the passions are generally dismissed by people from vorin strongholds such as alethkar and jah keved. elhokar kholin calls them heretical, while shallan davar and navani kholin see them as a pagan pseudo-religion or set of superstitions. jasnah kholin believes that all religions, including the passions, are equally impossible to verify. fen tells dalinar kholin that as a result of his heresy, some of her people are calling for thaylenah to abandon vorinism altogether in favor of the passions. however, the return of the voidbringers, whose culture and practice bear similarity to the passions, has resulted in its falling further out of favor. trivia[edit] - a - such as the - may have effects that correspond to the passions. notes[edit]"
Hesina,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Hesina,"hesina is a female darkeyed alethi of the second nahn on roshar. she lives in hearthstone with her husband, lirin and her youngest son, oroden. she is also the mother of kaladin and tien. hesina's home is built on the outskirts of hearthstone and is larger than the normal household building due to the inclusion of her husband's surgery room. appearance and personality[edit] hesina is a pretty darkeyed woman, with full lips, a narrow face and a bold chin. she is tall and stands several fingers above her husband. she has dark hair that is usually in a tail and wrapped in a kerchief. hesina often wears brown clothing, sometimes with a hint of color. during the colder months, she wears a knitted hat over her kerchief and a long brown coat to keep warm. like many darkeyed women, she covers her safehand with a glove as it is more practical. hesina is quick witted and sharp tongued. she is open minded and wishes for her children to have a choice over their future callings. she is an eloquent speaker and expects the same of her children. unlike the other mothers in hearthstone, hesina rarely chastises her sons for odd behaviour and sometimes joins them. she enjoys working around the town, cleaning buildings and removing crem, as she finds it a useful way to clear her head. beliefs[edit] ""“spren appear when something changes-when fear appears, or when it begins to rain. they are the heart of change, and therefore the heart of all things. ”-hesina"" hesina follows the vorin religion and is more religious that her husband. she has faith in the power of glyphwards, often burning them for her family or giving them to her sons. she has a preference for simple and straightforward glyphs. hesina believes that all things, with the exception of people, have a spren living within them. when objects such as food are consumed, the spren within them are freed to return to their home. people, by contrast, have souls instead of spren, however, hesina believes that small spren can reside in parts of the body. a similar thought is echoed by syl, when she discusses the genders of kaladin's weapons with him. attributes and abilities[edit] while not a surgeon like her husband, hesina will occasionally assist lirin with his surgeries. her role in her husband's work diminishes as lirin takes on apprentices, first kaladin, then mara--however, hesina occasionally assists if multiple helpers are required. hesina is able to both read and write in the alethi women's script. she is the only darkeyed woman in hearthstone who is able to read, though this skill isn't uncommon among higher ranking darkeyed women. history[edit] although her exact parentage and place of birth are unknown, at least one of hesina's parents was not a darkeyes. by the time hesina was seventeen, they lived in tomat, where hesina's father was a privileged business owner and was able to bully the citylord into following his wishes. after meeting lirin, hesina moved away from her family to live in hearthstone and started a family, leading to a drop in her social status. two years after the birth of her first son, kaladin, hesina was blessed with the birth of her second child, tien. there is a large age gap of eighteen years between tien and her third child, oroden. due to their close ties to the local brightlord, hesina and her husband had hoped to secure an allegiance between the two families through marriage. when brightlord wistiow fell gravely ill, making the likelihood of the union improbable, hesina and her husband conspired to steal a significant amount of wealth from the brightlord to secure passage for their son to continue his studies in kharbranth. the family claimed that the diamond broams had been bequeathed to lirin by wistiow on his deathbed, a claim that they supported with forged documentation. despite their best efforts to legitimize the agreement, rumors of theft persisted amongst the other townsfolk. the butcher[edit] after his death, wistiow was replaced by brightord roshone as the lord of hearthstone. on the day of his arrival, hesina was found by kaladin, cleaning and working at the town hall. frustrated with the gossiping townsfolk, kaladin spoke to his mother about the rumors surrounding their family as well as his place within the town. while talking, hesina admitted that she had hoped for kaladin to be able to marry laral, the daughter of brightlord wistiow. the arrival of roshone pulled hesina away from her work, as the town gathered to greet the new brightlord. joining her second son tien, who had saved places for the family in the town square, hesina and her family waited to greet the new citylord. roshone's arrival did not bode well for the family, with the brightlord taking an immediate disliking towards her husband, despite lirin's attempts to welcome the him to hearthstone. torment of the family[edit] roshone, aware of the inherited spheres and the possibility of their illegitimate procurement, demanded their return, of which lirin refused. roshone continued to fuel the rumors that the spheres had been stolen and the agreement forged, whilst also driving the family towards destitution. despite his best efforts, hesina and her family did not suffer as much as roshone assumed, as the townsfolk continued donating to the family in secret, leaving food around the town for hesina to find. when the possibilities of work for hesina dried up due to roshone's meddling, lirin met with the brightlord to discuss the disputed spheres and the family's situation. in an attempt to hide the meeting between lirin and roshone, hesina recruited her sons to help her with housework, hoping to keeping them distracted and occupied. ultimately, her plan was unsuccessful, and kaladin escaped his duties, joining his father in lirin's meeting with roshone. after the meeting, kaladin discovered his father's plans to deceive roshone, as well as the truth behind the acquisition of wistiow's wealth. kaladin was shocked not only to learn that the rumors that the spheres were stolen were true, but also that his mother had taken part in their theft. following the death of roshone's son rillir, the family fell further towards poverty and hesina and her husband began to slowly spend the stolen spheres. this was done deliberately; while the family indeed struggled, the spheres were spent, not because it was required, but instead as a way to deceive roshone and deflect his attention. the weeping of 1168[edit] despite their attempts to curb roshone's anger, hesina and her husband were ultimately unsuccessful. after spending time with her sons in the rain, hesina and her family joined the townsfolk of hearthstone to welcome highmarshal amaram--a general for the highprince and cousin of roshone. amaram, who had gone to hearthstone to visit his cousin, used his visit as a recruitment opportunity for the princedom's army. after only six men volunteered, amaram began conscripting men from the village, including hesina's son tien. unlike his father and brother, tien wasn't exempt from conscription on the basis of his duties, a fact that roshone exploited, impressing the boy as retribution for lirin's inability to save his own son's life. kaladin, unable to let his brother face the battlefield alone, volunteered to join, promising his parents that he would keep his younger sibling safe from harm. less than four months later, tien was killed. after his death, hesina received a short message from kaladin, informing them of his brother's death and that he would not be returning to hearthstone. they did not send him a reply. years later, after kaladin was sold into slavery, hesina and lirin received word that he had also been killed. roshone's guilt over what he had done lessened his hostility towards hesina and her husband, with life quieting down somewhat after the departure of their children. after the everstorm[edit] after the coming of the everstorm, hesina was reunited with kaladin when he returned to hearthstone. after arriving at the battered manor, kaladin located his mother and father in the parlor, tending to those who were wounded by the everstorm. while her husband argued with roshone's guards, hesina saw to her son, feeding him and filling him in on their family's situation. later, after he spoke privately with roshone and laral, hesina introduced kaladin to his younger brother, oroden. when kaladin departed to track down the transformed parshmen, hesina stayed behind with her husband in hearthstone to aid the townsfolk and care for her son oroden. relationships[edit] hesina's parents[edit] one of hesina's parents is not darkeyed, and since hesina describes her father as ""stubborn as a lighteyes"" rather than actually lighteyed, it is likely that this refers to her mother. they are of a higher social standing than their daughter. the initial meeting between lirin and hesina's parents goes quite poorly. hesina's parents are rarely mentioned, particularly around her children. however, she is still in contact with them, and when the family falls on tough times after the arrival of roshone, hesina's parents offer aid to the family. lirin[edit] hesina and lirin meet and fall in love during his travels, after which hesina moves with lirin to hearthstone. they have a loving relationship, though they don't see eye to eye over kaladin's study habits when he is young or over religion. later, they disagree sharply over kaladin's actions as a knight radiant, with hesina trying to persuade lirin to accept their son's decision to fight rather than to be a surgeon. kaladin[edit] hesina and her husband hope that one day their son kaladin would be able to marry laral, the daughter of the brightlord wistiow. during his earlier years, his parents often encourage both kaladin and his brother to play with laral to help strengthen the bond between the two families. hesina often banters with her son, kaladin, who inherits her tendency towards clever wordplay. as a child, kaladin remembers his parents being at odds with each other over the importance of his commitment to study. while his father wishes for him to focus on his future and the chance to study and learn in kharbranth, his mother wishes for him to be able to enjoy his childhood. whether due to or despite these disagreements, kaladin is granted two hours a day by his father where he is not required to study. after the arrival of roshone, kaladin's parents try and get him to kharbranth earlier than normally allowed, writing to the surgeons and requesting for their son to take the entry tests early. their request is denied. when they are reunited, kaladin finds that his mother still treats him like a child despite their many years apart. she is delighted to find out that her son is a knight radiant. trivia[edit] - she was originally named hessica, but this was changed before the release of - to better align with alethi naming conventions. brandon sometimes still writes her name as hessica in drafts. notes[edit]"
Vai,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Vai,"vai is a seven-year-old singer on roshar. she is sah's daughter, and one of the younger girls in their traveling group. appearance and personality[edit] like the other young female singers, vai wears her hair loose rather than tied or in a braid like the boys. while bearing a resemblance to her elders, she does not have quite the same armored parshendi appearance, instead having the light orange-pink carapace typical of singer children. vai doesn't wear shoes, which causes her feet to be covered with scratches and scrapes despite them being tough from calluses. she appears timid at first when dealing with kaladin, but he soon realizes that she is not timid, just nervous. history[edit] meeting kaladin[edit] vai and her father, sah, were enslaved as parshmen in northern alethkar. sah cared for vai after her mother was sold because she was considered good breeding stock. after the coming of the everstorm released them from slaveform, they traveled with khen and a group of fellow singers following a guiding spren. after they captured kaladin, vai ran and took the hand of her father as he led kaladin from hornhollow to revolar. while sah played cards with kaladin coaching him, vai tugged on sah's arm and pointed. after a whispered response from sah, vai ran on her tiptoes towards a patch of flowering rockbuds. she squatted and waited for each to open and then she snatched one with each hand, giggling as she did. she returned, giving kaladin a wide berth. ""“why can't they just let us go? could you go back and tell them? we don't want trouble. we just want to go away.”-vai's plea to kaladin "" vai's actions helped kaladin realize that the awakened singers weren't monsters, but he still referred to them as runaway slaves. the comment upset sah, who confessed that he spent each night clutching his daughter wondering how long they would be trapped in the shadows. he grabbed kaladin and asked him if he truly understood what it was like watching your family being torn apart and being completely unable to stop it. sah dropped kaladin and picked up his daughter, holding her close as he ran to catch up with the others. as kaladin was pulled along, he inadvertently stepped on vai's flower in his haste. ""“no. we're nice. we've always been nice. i never hit anyone, even when i was mad.”-vai to kaladin "" kaladin offered to help the singers, but sah questioned whether or not he really just wanted them to get caught. as sah walked off to confer with the other singers, vai walked over to where kaladin sat, bringing him a waterskin. she then backed away, but didn't flee as kaladin reached for the waterskin. when he thanked her, she asked if the other humans would chase them, and why they couldn't just let them go. she asked kaladin if he could go back and tell them that they didn't want trouble. kaladin apologized, but he told vai they would come because the former parshment were considered a ""resource"" that they couldn't ignore. vai sniffled and asked why, that they never tried to hurt them, that they were nice. she even promised that she never hit anyone when she was mad. kaladin explained that he didn't mean her, but vai's ancestors. however, he trailed off as he didn't know how to explain slavery to a seven-year-old. he tossed the waterskin back to her and she ran back to her father. revolar[edit] when the singers and kaladin approached revolar, sah carried vai on his shoulder so she could have a better view. she held onto some wooden cards, clutching them like another child might carry a favorite stuffed doll. as they walked, sah told kaladin that he'd dreamed of the parshmen having their own city, and here it was. kaladin asked if that was what this was all about, conquering the kingdom, destroying humankind. sah said he didn't know, but he could not be a slave again and he would not let them take vai and imprison her. separation from sah[edit] unfortunately, vai was taken from her father by order of the fused when sah, khen, and the other singers in their group were sent along with moash to fight in the siege of kholinar. this was supposedly a punishment for ""harboring"" kaladin as a spy, although in reality the fused were looking for reasons to conscript more singers into their infantry. sah was enraged by this development, but had no recourse. he was ultimately killed in the fighting; kaladin, who participated in the battle alongside the kholinar wall guard, slumped to his knees upon seeing sah fall, recalling that all he ever wanted was to protect his daughter. vai's whereabouts after being separated from her father are unknown but she is still alive. notes[edit]"
Lirin,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lirin,"""“somebody has to start. somebody has to step forward and do what is right, because it is right. if nobody starts, then others cannot follow. ”-lirin"" lirin is a darkeyed alethi surgeon and citizen of the second nahn. he lives and works on the outskirts of hearthstone within the sadeas princedom of alethkar. lirin is married to hesina and is the father of kaladin, tien, and oroden. as second nahn, lirin and his family are full citizens of alethkar and have the right to travel and the right of inquest. additionally, lirin's position as a surgeon grants him further legal protections such as immunity from enlistment. lirin's ancestors had not always been of such a high rank, and the forefathers bought and worked their way up the social ladder throughout multiple generations. lirin's home is built on the outskirts of hearthstone and is larger than the normal household building due to the inclusion of his surgery room. appearance and personality[edit] appearance[edit] lirin is balding, thin, and bespectacled. he is diminutive and stands several fingers shorter than his wife. he rarely wears his glasses except when performing surgery as they are one of his most valued possessions, and he fears breaking or damaging them as they would be difficult to replace. personality[edit] lirin rarely drinks, but his alcohol consumption increased after the death of wistiow and the arrival of roshone. he enjoys calculating the trajectory of the highstorms, and going on walks to clear his head. lirin is stubborn and dislikes ambiguity, often becoming pessimistic when faced with uncertainty. while he prefers not to cause unnecessary strife or embarrassment, and will discount town gossip, he will confront those who pose a threat. he is considered to be quite strange by the other townsfolk, and they are often uncomfortable around both him and his family. while his wife attributes this reaction to his learning and knowledge, lirin finds that their hostility comes, at least in part, from their insecurities surrounding his family's higher social standing. regardless of their discomfort, the townsfolk of hearthstone respect lirin and appreciate the work he does. lirin, in turn, cares about the people of hearthstone, despite their aversion to him, and feels tied to the town through his connections with the other residents. lirin can be highly critical, particularly of those he does not agree with, and is a strong opponent to needless danger. he is strongly averse to violence, and disagrees with the need for war, as well as the calling of being a soldier. he would rather allow multiple people to die than kill a single person himself. his explanations of the world are given with precision and are sometimes sterile in nature. beliefs[edit] ""“the heralds were sent to teach mankind ... they led us against the voidbringers after we were cast from heaven. ”-lirin to kaladin"" lirin believes in the teachings of the heralds, who have shared roots with the practice of medicine. he teaches his son kaladin of their wisdom during his apprenticeship and is always carefully to outline the distinction between the heralds and the knights radiant. according to lirin, one of the fundamental tenets of the vorin religion is the ability to climb in social rank. lirin does not believe in folktales about voidbringers, though he does acknowledge that they were the enemies of the heralds. he has some level of awareness of the spiritual realm, but he conflates it with the afterlife. attributes and abilities[edit] surgery and teaching[edit] ""“the children of the men and women whose lives we save. that's who tells stories of surgeons. ”-lirin to kaladin"" lirin trained as a surgeon under vathe in the town of shorsebroon near hearthstone. lirin is a decent surgeon, both steady and calm under pressure, though if he was to live in a larger city he would likely only be a medical assistant rather than a surgeon in his own right. he takes on two apprentices, first his son kaladin, and later, mara. he is particular about keeping time during his surgeries and is the only person in the town to own a fabrial clock. lirin is also conscious of the quality of light he uses when treating patients, and for a long time has a goblet of spheres on permanent loan from brightlord wistiow. he has lived and worked in hearthstone for long enough that the other citizens sometimes hold him to expectations that are impossible to reach, and will react in anger when he is unable to work miracles. lirin believes that lives are priceless and as such does not charge for his work as a surgeon. he is meticulous about the cleanliness of his surgery and his family spends large amounts of time keeping both the rooms and the medical tools clean. after a surgery, lirin coats his tools in oil after first cleaning them with alcohol. this is one of the older traditions of the medical field. as a surgeon, lirin has accepted that he will not always be able to save those in his care and must sometimes make the difficult decision to prioritise one patient over another. he works by a specific set of guidelines: if the patients are equally wounded, then treat the youngest, if not, treat the most severe. above all else, however, know when a patient is beyond saving. history[edit] early history[edit] as a youth, lirin traveled to kharbranth as a courier, where he was introduced to different cultures and societies. he had particularly poor luck when meeting people from thaylenah, all of whom tried to swindle him. while traveling he met hesina, the daughter of a high-ranked family, and they fell in love. although his initial introduction to her parents was a disaster, hesina and lirin got married and began a family in hearthstone. the surgeon and his apprentice[edit] lirin began training his son kaladin in the profession of surgery from a young age. when kaladin was ten, he worked with his father on a young girl, sani, who had major injuries to one of her hands. the surgery doubled as a learning opportunity, and together lirin and his son were able to save four of the girl's five fingers. after the operation, kaladin helped his father to clean the surgery room and discussed why he had been late. disapproving of his son's choices to hang around with older village boys like jam, lirin argued with kaladin over the usefulness of surgeons and soldiers. after shifting the conversation, lirin continued his son's study, quizzing him on various diseases and medicines. he believed kaladin had great potential and expressed his desire to send kaladin to kharbranth after he turned sixteen to study. several years later, kaladin unsuccessfully tried to save the life of miasal, who had fallen from a considerable height. lirin was called to the scene by alim, but did not arrive before the girl died. afterwards, lirin sought out kaladin, and found him weeping on the steps near the surgery room. before coming to find his son, he had gone to inspect the child, and despite kaladin's inability to save her, he was impressed by the work kaladin had done. the two of them sat together as the sun set, while kaladin continued to grieve. brightlord wistiow and the goblet of spheres[edit] lirin and brightlord wistiow were close friends despite the differences in their social standing. in 1165, the brightlord fell ill and was attended by lirin who, despite his best efforts, was unable to save the citylord's life. on the day of wistiow's death, lirin traveled to his manor to speak with the man. during his visit, he prepared documentation on behalf of the brightlord, that would gift his family a number of diamond broams. after the document was read to the brightlord by his clerks, wistiow ordered his staff from the room, leaving lirin as the only witness to his authorization of the transaction. later, after returning home, lirin was found by kaladin in his surgery room. after telling his son of the brightlord's passing, lirin informed him about the ""inherited"" spheres and how they would be used to pay for kaladin's further study in kharbranth when he was older. the brightlord was not in his right mind during his last few days and did not have the capacity to transfer this wealth. lirin, with the help of his wife hesina, engineered the theft of their friend's wealth, as they knew that his death would mean the loss of the potential union between their children. rumors sprang up not long after the brightlord's death surrounding the legitimacy of the transaction, though concrete evidence was never produced to prove the spheres had been stolen. on a rare night of indulgence, lirin warned his elder son against returning to hearthstone after finishing his studies. the pair were shortly interrupted by a group of masked townsmen who had come to rob them and take wistiow's spheres. lirin knew they were members of the town, and not bandits as assumed by kaladin, and refused to be intimidated by them. instead of cowering, he removed the cloth covering the spheres, and lit up the night, exposing the thieves and taking away their anonymity. when lirin showed he was willing to stand against them, the men disappeared, probably ashamed of their actions. the butcher[edit] when the new citylord, roshone, arrived in hearthstone without prior warning, lirin and his family gathered in the town square to greet him. though lirin attempted to welcome the new citylord into the town, roshone immediately sneered at him and rebuffed his efforts, blaming him for wistiow's death and the need for a new citylord in hearthstone. after roshone departed for his manor, lirin compared his arrival with that of throwing a butcher in the game breakneck-- what comes next depended entirely on the other player. life for lirin went downhill quickly after roshone's appointment as citylord. roshone suspected that lirin stole wistiow's spheres, though lirin claimed they were given to him, and attempted to coerce lirin into giving the spheres to him with his economic and political clout. at roshone's suggestion, the townspeople ceased their donations and inflated the price of their goods, as they felt intimidated by roshone and wished to avoid his anger. however, they continued to donate in secret, leaving food around the town for hesina to find while she worked. ""“if we lack for something to eat, we can feast upon the attention you lavish upon us, brightlord.”-lirin to roshone"" after the family lost access to all sources of income, roshone invited lirin to dine with him, so he could further break the surgeon. despite his mother's attempts to distract him, kaladin joined his father for the meeting. on their way to the manor, lirin discussed the possibility of the family moving away, but admitted he struggled with the thought. tensions were high when lirin and kaladin joined roshone in the manor's dining room. initially, roshone tried to seat the surgeon at a separate table; an insult against lirin, who was entitled to a seat at the brightlord's table by his invitation and rank. despite being offered food, lirin did not eat, instead choosing to skip directly to the reason for his invitation. roshone wished for the return of wistiow's spheres, which lirin had continuously refused. the citylord could not regain the spheres using legal means, as he was unlikely to win an inquest against the surgeon. unable to get past lirin's stubborn refusal to return all of the spheres, roshone turned to negotiation. after an outburst from kaladin, lirin sent his son away to the kitchens and continued the discussion with roshone in private. during the conversation, he argued back and forth with the citylord over the amount he was willing to return, but he pretended to grow frustrated and left before an agreement was reached. lirin later revealed to kaladin on their trip home that he never intended to give up the spheres. he had gone to the meeting to give the appearance of bending but had known that roshone would never have agreed to only a partial transfer. roshone was a petty man, who targeted and lashed out at lirin as a surrogate for those he blamed for his exile from kholinar. he would never be happy until he had taken away all power from lirin and had been beaten down completely. lirin, aware of the brightlord's plans, used the opportunity to gain his family a reprieve from the oppressive citylord. it was during this same discussion that kaladin learned the truth about wistiow's spheres and his parents' role in their theft. children lost[edit] rillir[edit] after a catastrophic whitespine hunt, roshone's son, rillir, died whilst in lirin's care. the young man was brought back, along with his father, ahead of the rest of the hunting party in the hopes he could be saved. two others were injuries in the attack, however alds and milp had been left to be retrieved by the other townsfolk. they likely died of their wounds. rillir's wounds were extensive, and after an assessment, lirin determined he could not save the boy. roshone, lying on a separate table screamed at the surgeon to help his son, however, lirin instead opted to tend to roshone, whose wounds weren't as severe. he administered dazewater to the brightlord to calm him, as well as to rillir to ease his suffering. when he removed the whitespine tusk from roshone's leg, lirin was presented with the opportunity to end the citylord's life. unable to kill those in his charge, he instead chose to save the brightlord's life. after the operation, roshone was returned to his manor to rest and his son's body sent to the crypt. once again sitting on the steps outside of their home, kaladin questioned his father over whether he would have let roshone die if he had not also been in the room. lirin responded in the negative; he could not have let another in his care die, though kaladin's presence had helped to strengthen his resolve. after rillir's death, lirin began to spend brightlord wistiow's spheres. he did not need to do this; the family could survive as they were and had been offered assistance by hesina's parents if required. however, by spending the spheres lirin presented the illusion that roshone had won and he had finally broken. he planned to continue in this fashion until kaladin had reached the age of sixteen, and the spheres could be sent with him to kharbranth. regardless, lirin did not enjoy having to spend the spheres. tien and kaladin[edit] six months later, during the weeping, the townsfolk of hearthstone gathered once more in the square to await the arrival of a lighteyes. the last time they had gathered, roshone had become their city lord, this time they were greeted by highmarshal amaram, cousin to roshone and leader of the princedom's army, in the absence of highprince sadeas. roshone, who had become reclusive following his son's death, also made an appearance. when laral appeared, and it became obvious she was now betrothed to roshone, lirin sternly warned kaladin against making a scene. amaram, who had been in the region to visit his cousin, used the opportunity to recruit new members to fight on the princedom's border. lirin worried that kaladin would volunteer, however his son did not step forward. after only six men volunteered, amaram read through a list of townsfolk who would be pressed into the army to increase their numbers. among the names chosen, was tien, lirin's second son. the conscription of tien had not been random. roshone, vindictive and angry that lirin had been unable to save rillir, conspired to take away the surgeon's son. while lirin and kaladin could not be forced into the army due to their professions of surgeon and surgeon's assistant, tien as the carpenter's third apprentice could be targeted. lirin attempted to prevent his son being taken, but was interceded by the highmarshal. roshone insisted that lirin's second son be impressed, and gloated at the victory he believed to have won over the surgeon. in an attempt to calm the situation, amaram promised to make the boy a messenger to keep him away from combat. kaladin, unwilling to let the matter lie, offered to volunteer in his brother's place. when denied, he chose to enlist alongside his brother to protect him from harm. kaladin promised his devastated parents that he would take care of tien and bring him home after their four-year tour. tien died, not four months after their departure. lirin and hesina received correspondence from kaladin after his brother's death to inform them of his failure as well as his decision to not return to hearthstone. they did not reply. several years later, they received notice that kaladin had also been killed. child found[edit] a year before the everstorm, lirin's third son, oroden was born. ""“we're surgeons. let others rend and break; we must not harm others.”-lirin to kaladin"" when kaladin returned to hearthstone following the everstorm, he found his father tending to the wounded. the parlor of roshone's manor had been converted into a triage room for lirin, his wife, and his apprentice, mara, to use to see to the wounded. although he did not initially recognize his son, lirin quickly came to identify the newcomer and both he and hesina shared a heartfelt reunion with kaladin. lirin argued with roshone's guards who had been put on edge by kaladin's brands. he refused to let his son be sent away again, and vowed to buy kaladin's writ of slavery, if needed. after growing frustrated, he looked to compromise with roshone's guard, and by extension the brightlord himself, by writing to highprince's administrators for an explanation, buying the family time. while kaladin discussed the town's situation in private with roshone, lirin continued to treat those wounded by the everstorm. when he returned to the parlor, kaladin slipped back into his old role as assistant, and helped his father administer first aid. lirin disapproved of kaladin's path towards violence; while he believed war was inevitable, he wished that his son did not have to be involved. although kaladin expressed the desire to relocate his family to urithiru, lirin refused, telling his son that he was needed in hearthstone. the fourth bridge[edit] because of this, kaladin arranged to evacuate the entire population of hearthstone via the fourth bridge. after lirin learned that some of the radiants can heal others, he grew withdrawn, as he felt that his talents as a surgeon had been rendered obsolete. after kaladin explained that only two orders of radiants can use the surge of progression and the limits of its power, lirin became excited to work in urithiru's medical clinic and to begin exploring the new medical equipment from kharbranth that kaladin got for him. then, after kaladin told lirin about how he would be leaving the army, lirin was overjoyed. the occupation of urithiru[edit] after kaladin and lirin learned that all of the radiants were falling unconscious, lirin convinced kaladin not to go out and fight. a regal came to collect the fallen radiants lirin was taking care of in the clinic, and he tried unsuccessfully to keep the radiants with him. when kaladin attempted to intervene, lirin tried to stop him from fighting, but kaladin blocked him and killed the regal, after which lirin got mad at him and sent him away. lirin and hesina were later brought in to take care of the comatose radiants, as the singers could not. while they were working, venli and rlain arrived with a crate of maps rlain had stolen, and they discussed what to do with them; lirin emphasised that he did not want to fight the occupation. lirin saw that several of the water bearers had shash glyphs on their foreheads, and he explained to venli how he thought they were a foolish idea. later, rlain came to the infirmary, and lirin told rlain that the stormform guards the pursuer posted there had seen him. they discussed whether or not they could trust leshwi and venli, and rlain admitted that he did not know. lirin abruptly recognized dabbid among the workers in the infirmary; the man told him and rlain that kaladin was dying. lirin adamantly insisted to rlain that he would not promise not to give kaladin up to the fused after he healed him. hesina volunteered to go instead, but lirin told her she wouldn't be able to heal kaladin by herself. venli suggested freeing lift and getting her to heal kaladin. while talking together one day, hesina brought up kaladin, and lirin immediately argued that he was right in his attitude towards kaladin and tried to leave. hesina stopped him and told him that kaladin was the best person to be a soldier. when he called the helpers wearing shash glyphs fools, she led him to noril, who said that he wore the shash glyph because kaladin, unlike the ardents, had helped with his depression. hesina then asked lirin to go to the rest of the people wearing shash glyphs and ask why they wear them. when teft entered the infirmary after the occupying force discovered the sibling's final node, he noticed lirin, hesina, and oroden bound and gagged in the back. after kaladin became insensate upon teft's death, moash took lirin and gave him to the pursuer with instructions to kill him if kaladin regained his senses. the pursuer gave him to leshwi, who cut lirin's hands free before giving him to another heavenly one so she could try to stop the pursuer. kaladin defeated the pursuer and went for lirin, but the heavenly one panicked and shot off, taking lirin up to the roof. kaladin followed the panicked flight, but as he advanced on the heavenly one, she threw lirin off the roof. after speaking the fourth ideal, kaladin caught up to his father and grabbed his arm to slow his fall. the two of them hugged, and kaladin explained that he realized that both of their ways were correct, for them. lirin berated him for cutting the rescue so close. kaladin discovered the shash glyph on lirin's forehead, and lirin told him he was trying to show faith in him. lirin brushed aside kaladin's hair to see his brand, only to discover that it had finally healed. kaladin flew lirin back to the tower. relationships[edit] hesina[edit] lirin does not get along well with hesina's parents and as such they are not often spoken of around kaladin or his brother. lirin's introduction to his wife's parents went quite poorly. marrying lirin greatly impacted hesina's social standing and lirin occasionally regrets the sacrifices she made to move with him to hearthstone. they do not always see eye to eye, and lirin finds hesina's religious beliefs frustrating. regardless, he loves his wife and they are happy together. hesina occasionally helps her husband during his surgeries if multiple assistants are needed or if lirin's apprentice isn't available. tien[edit] lirin had hoped he would be able to take tien on as a second apprentice, who could take over from his brother when kaladin left for kharbranth. unfortunately, tien's phobia of blood prevented him from following in his fathers footsteps and lirin reluctantly let him apprentice to the carpenter, ral. lirin is protective of his son and enjoys his excitable nature. he is devastated when tien is forced into the army by roshone and it is only amaram interceding that stopped him from causing a scene on the day tien was recruited. he disapproves of both of his son's hanging around the older children in the town, particularly those who encouraged fighting and the revere the calling of soldier. kaladin[edit] ""“there are two kinds of people in this world, son. those who save lives. and those who take lives. ”-lirin to kaladin"" kaladin was trained by lirin as a surgeon's assistant and showed a great aptitude in the field of medicine. he is proud of his son's work as a surgeon and believes with training and dedication, kaladin can surpass him in skill. during his childhood, kaladin's parents were at odds over how much time he should spend studying versus having a traditional childhood. whether due to, or despite these disagreements, kaladin is granted two hours a day by his father where he is not required to study. ""“you have to learn when to care, son. ... and when to let go. you'll see. i had similar problems when i was younger. you'll grow calluses.”-lirin to kaladin"" lirin hoped to send kaladin to study in kharbranth, where he could further his training under medical scholars. after the arrival of roshone, lirin and his wife request for kaladin to take the entry tests early, however their request is denied. despite warning kaladin (during one of his gloomier moments), against becoming stuck in hearthstone, lirin has always hoped his son would return home after completing further study. throughout his training, kaladin often struggles with the emotional burden of losing patients. while lirin sympathises with his son's need to care, he also is resolute in his teachings that there is such a thing as caring too much. nevertheless, he is proud of his son's abilities. kaladin admires his father's bravery and his ability to stand up to those who outrank him. he is proud to be his father's son, though he questions the morality of some of lirin's choices. lirin doubts kaladin's ability to cause harm to others and is deeply disappointed when confronted with the fact that his son owns a shardblade and has become a killer. roshone[edit] ""“the lighteyes don't care about life ... so i must. ... we have to be better than they are. ”-lirin to kaladin"" there is a great deal of animosity between lirin and the citylord of hearthstone, brightlord roshone. roshone's resentment of lirin, while initially stemming from his relocation to the farming town, is further fueled by lirin's stubbornness as well as the death of roshone's son. in turn, lirin dislikes roshone's pettiness and condescending attitude and find him to be greedy and a bully. roshone wishes to break lirin's will instead of simply drive him away, and would not make it easy for the family to move away from hearthstone. lirin does not allow his distaste of roshone to interfere with his duties as a surgeon, despite the burden it would ease for his family. the relationship between roshone and lirin, while remaining hostile, settles down after the depature of tien and kaladin, likely due to roshone's guilt. notes[edit]"
Lezian,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lezian,"""“any time he is killed, lezian ignores everything else until he has claimed the life of the one who killed him. seven thousand years, and he’s never failed. ”-leshwi explaining lezian's tradition"" lezian, the pursuer, is one of the nex-im, a rare fused brand on roshar which has access to the surge of transportation. appearance and personality[edit] appearance[edit] lezian is described as being easily seven feet tall. he has hair the color of dried blood, and it seems to meld into his clothing, which is woven out of his hair. his skin is pure black, with lines of red marbling around his softly glowing red eyes. he also has a markedly wicked-looking jagged carapace, with a strange pair of carapace fins/horns rising above his ears. kaladin describes him as a hulking mountain of chitin and dark brown cloth, with eyes glowing a deep red. it is unknown which of these characteristics (other than his skin color and patterning) are uniquely his, over being shared with other nex-im. personality[edit] lezian considers it of the utmost importance that his tradition (of killing whoever killed him) continues, and it doesn't matter to him whether he beats and kills his quarry in genuine combat, or murders them when they are defenseless and unconscious. venli remarks that in this, he is more like a spren, with his tradition taking over his reason. she also notes that in this, lezian also has a madness to him, much like many of the other fused, even if the way it affects him is subtler. even lezian calls himself a spren of vengeance, someone who would never stop hunting his quarry, giving them no respite. the fact that the everstorm allows the fused to continue their cycle of rebirths without going to braize only makes this more certain, and raboniel corroborates it. lezian - like many of the fused - prefers not to speak alethi (or any other modern human language) though he is proficient enough to be able to understand and speak it if he wants/needs to. according to leshwi, lezian takes great pride in worming his way into the stories of the humans, and manages to do so every return. she also notes that while he is respected for his determination, he is reckless, and has endangered plans and ruined missions with that particular quality. attributes and abilities[edit] surgebinding[edit] as one of the nex-im, lezian has access to the surge of transportation. this allows him to leave his body behind and shoot out of it as a spren-like flying ribbon of red-violet light, which can then expand to re-form a new body elsewhere. the old body collapses as if it was a dead corpse, and disintegrates into ash within minutes. this effectively allows lezian to teleport, using the ribbon of light to transfer between locations. lezian can do four such ""jumps"" before completely running out of voidlight, and typically uses three of them in battle, using the fourth to retreat and resupply. once lezian leaves a body, the ""corpse"" that he leaves behind starts turning dry and fragile, with colors fading. the flesh turns to a light and porous stone, and the whole body (including the carapace) disintegrates into ash soon after. combat skills[edit] lezian uses a fighting style based around forms of grappling, and is extremely proficient at fighting surgebinders. he can break off his sharp and jagged carapace spurs to use as improvised daggers. he is also proficient at using the quirks of his powers to his advantage, such as when he breaks battalionlord teofil's battle lines by attacking from several directions and using his husks as decoys to sow confusion. leadership[edit] according to venli, lezian's troops have a fearsome reputation. they were among the strongest and proudest of singer troops, and were known for treating the humans of kholinar harshly. during the occupation, they resent the fact that they were not allowed to kill during the original incursion into urithiru, and both leshwi and venli see them as violent and bloodthirsty. after a warform singer is let live by kaladin, and flees, lezian's troops consider him a coward and assign him to waste detail. they also yearn to spill the blood of kaladin's family, after he kills a regal. lezian is also extremely proficient at using the forces at his disposal to assist in his hunts. during the initial occupation, he has his forces combing for fallen radiants throughout the sixth floor, when they first run into kaladin. lezian is immediately able to bring this entire force to bear, repurposing it to hunt for kaladin specifically. later, venli notes that lezian has been using his troops to slowly comb through the fifteenth floor, further noting that he had already searched the eighth. it can be inferred from this that lezian had been sequentially combing through the floors, from the bottom up. history[edit] previous desolations[edit] lezian was the first fused to have ever been killed by a human. to avoid the shame that came from this, he went into battle seeking only the human that had killed him, ignoring all orders and rationality, and succeeded in killing him. this started his tradition - every time someone managed to kill him, lezian would single-mindedly chase them and claim their life. he never failed at this, always successfully managing to find and kill the humans who had bested him before every isolation. once an isolation began, he would kill himself to avoid having to return to braize without killing his killer in turn. when not actively pursuing a previous killer, lezian would seek to go after the strongest enemy radiants, effectively creating a cycle of either chasing after and killing the strongest enemies, or getting killed by them, and then pursuing them until they die, then picking some other strong radiant, and so on and forth. lezian was good enough at this that no human or singer had ever managed to best him and kill him twice. he was so successful at this that the other fused encouraged his tradition, giving him leeway to act and pursue his quarry even outside normal command structures, though he was also reckless enough to have endangered others' plans, ruining missions and undermining strategies. the true desolation[edit] the evacuation of hearthstone[edit] lezian first appears at hearthstone in 1175, just before the knights radiant and the forces of the coalition land the fourth bridge there in an effort to evacuate the village. kaladin and the fourth bridge had been spotted while flying to hearthstone, and lezian, alongside a group of shanay-im under the command of leshwi, were sent by the nine to gather intel on the fourth bridge, and test a new suppressor fabrial that would prevent radiants from using their powers. ""“watch for me from the corner of your eye, windrunner. we’ll meet again soon.”-lezian"" lezian leads a small squad of warforms, and is able to successfully find and identify kaladin from his description, who takes to the skies. lezian engages him immediately, and his novel powerset and his brutal and expert fighting style give kaladin a hard time. when kaladin eventually starts predicting and reacting to lezian's jumps, lezian leaves him, warning kaladin to watch for him from the corner of his eye. he shows up again later, when kaladin and his windrunners are engaged with leshwi and the rest of the shanay-im, but kaladin sees him coming, and lezian retreats without engaging. he then gathers a squad of warform singers, and starts accosting a group of civilians, as well as godeke the edgedancer, to lure kaladin to him. when kaladin lands and challenges him, lezian takes godeke, and retreats into the manor with the remaining squad of parshmen, saying he will fight him inside. once kaladin follows, they trigger the suppressor fabrial powered by voidlight to stop kaladin from summoning syl or using his powers. lezian assumes that kaladin would not be used to fighting without his powers and mocks him, but kaladin quickly overpowers four of the warform singers, and then proceeds to kill lezian by successfully predicting where he would teleport to. lezian is then reborn again, soon after, and is summoned by the nine to provide a report on what happened at hearthstone. he refuses to take blame for losing the device, and immediately claims his right to pursue kaladin by his tradition. he is angered, and lashes out when leshwi challenges his sanity and his right to pursue kaladin, which undermines his claim, and leads to the nine allowing leshwi - or someone else if the situation demands it - prior claim on kaladin's life. lezian storms out of the meeting, and is later seen conferring with raboniel soon after the invasion on urithiru is decided upon. occupation of the tower[edit] lezian loans his troops to raboniel for the invasion. ""“you, who were once banished for recklessly endangering our kind in your attempts to exterminate humankind? you, lady of wishes, ask for restraint?”-lezian"" during the invasion, he approaches raboniel, and gets permission to continue his hunt for kaladin from her, as he is confident that if kaladin was not already at the tower, then he would return to try and liberate it. he also advises raboniel that the captured radiants were dangerous, and should be beheaded. lezian is later instrumental in breaking apart battalionlord teofil's final stand, as he is able to teleport across their entire line faster than they can reorient and readjust themselves. lezian is next seen tracking kaladin, after the latter kills one of the singers that came to lirin's clinic to collect any radiants that might be getting cared for there. he repurposes the entire force sent to go through the homes on the sixth floor looking for unconscious radiants to instead hunt for kaladin. while kaladin manages to avoid him once, and is able to distract him further with syl's help, he doesn't manage to permanently lose him, and lezian always catches on after a while. kaladin ultimately manages to escape the purser and his forces with the sibling's help. lezian continues to sweep the upper tiers for kaladin, sending raboniel reports periodically. he manages to capture kaladin's family and intends to exact revenge for the regal he killed, once he's done interrogating them. venli learns of this, and asks leshwi to intervene, who promptly takes kaladin's family into her custody, protecting them from the pursuer and his troops. during the occupation, lezian instructs all singers to watch out for signs of radiants. hunting the shield nodes[edit] ""“the pursuer isn’t lying, he will hunt you forever. to the abandonment of all reason and duty.”-raboniel about lezian"" when raboniel finds a node powering the sibling's defenses exposed to stormlight, the sibling asks for kaladin's help, who finds lezian and raboniel waiting for him there. lezian immediately engages him in a duel, dropping his first body as a husk and teleporting to get close. this time, he makes it much difficult for kaladin to predict where he would materialize, but kaladin still manages to use his powers and spear to immobilize both of lezian's hands. in response to this, lezian just drops his second body and teleports away, using its husk to trap kaladin's spear and keep it away from him. he is able to capitalize on his close quarters fighting style, alongside kaladin's relative inexperience with fighting an opponent like him, to pin him with a chokehold, and explains that even if kaladin manages to beat him a second time, he would never stop coming for him, as the presense of the everstorm means that the fused are no longer bound to braize. however, syl distracts him by acting as a voidspren, which allows kaladin enough leeway to break free, leaving lezian stuck to the floor with adhesion, who promptly drops a third body and teleports away to reinfuse and resupply. when lezian returns to continue the duel, kaladin quickly makes him drop two bodies by using full lashings to stick him to the floor, and then rolling away out of reach. however, lezian notices that kaladin is running low on stormlight, and - using the husk of his second body as an impromptu floor - stops kaladin from retrieving his stormlight from his full lashings. kaladin realizes that in this kind of one-on-one brawl, lezian will always have the advantage, and simply turns around and starts running away. lezian uses the respite to resupply from some of the voidlight that raboniel is carrying with her, and gives chase. this time again, kaladin is able to bait him into materializing and dropping several bodies quickly, and then, with the sibling's help, is able to use lezian's tendency to materialize behind him to trap his fourth and final body in a closed room. ""“when you die, i will find the next radiant your spren bonds and kill them too. as payment for the trouble you have given me.”-lezian"" the pursuer next shows up when the second-last node powering the sibling's shield is found, inside the well in the market. he is waiting for kaladin, and ambushes him as soon as he shows up. he manifests his first body to announce his presence, and - falsely assuming that kaladin was using gravitation to move about - is curious how kaladin recovered his access to it. kaladin, who was actually using the modified fabrial glove to quickly traverse the tower, uses it to shoot away. lezian immediately drops his first husk and gives pursuit, manifesting his second body to grapple with kaladin. he is thrown off by the presence of the glove, as it affects the close quarters, grappling focused fighting style he prefers, and soon drops another husk to disengage. this time, instead of immediately and aggressively attacking kaladin again, he keeps to his red ribbon-like spren form, staying around and distracting him, keeping him away from the node. kaladin, however, guns straight for the node, forcing lezian to materialize his third body to engage with him. lezian successfully grapples kaladin into a chokehold (again), who uses a previously hidden scalpel to cut at lezian's arms repeatedly. this forces him to spend precious voidlight healing those cuts and wounds, consequently making him drop his third body before he loses the voidlight to do so. as usual, after dropping his third husk, lezian retreats to resupply. by the time he returns, kaladin has already engaged with leshwi in single combat, and he has to respect her right to fight kaladin over his own. after syl locates the node, and kaladin disengages with leshwi to deal with it, lezian is again free to interfere. he is prepared for this eventuality, of kaladin having to dive into the well, and smiles as he seals kaladin inside by putting a wooden lid on top. he then directs people to stand on it to account for kaladin's potential use of lashings to lift the lid. while he waits outside for kaladin to suffocate, kaladin is able to escape by finding a different way out. ""“it isn’t the hiding that protects you, it is lady leshwi’s favor. without it, the pursuer would kill you, no matter what you did to prove yourself. he’d kill other fused, if he thought it would let him fulfill his tradition. and the others would applaud him.”-venli to lirin and hesina"" after this event, lezian is left with more free reign in leading the occupation efforts, as raboniel is focused more on her research. his troops dominated the tower, and reports of singer violence against the humans grew. as rumors of the confrontation in the market spread, the fused try to counter kaladin's growing reputation by spinning the narrative, and venli thinks that lezian is behind their messaging, as she feels that raboniel would have taken a subtler approach. later, when people start marking themselves with the shash glyph as a sign of defiance against the fused, and support for kaladin, lezian orders his men to beat those that do so. raboniel, however, revokes this order the next day. though raboniel tries to rein him and his men in, he keeps pushing for more brutality in the tower. raboniel's occasional orders to maintain peace in the tower barely restrain him and his men, and humans tended to avoid the area where they were housed. he posts several regals on rotation in the infirmary where lirin and hesina have been hiding, and lirin suspects that this is specifically because lezian knows they are there, even if he cannot do anything while leshwi's influence protects them. leshwi, on the otherhand, thinks that lezian is not so subtle, and that this was more raboniel's hand showing. ""“i’ve heard what people say about you. your life isn’t the blood in your veins, but the legend you live. each death kills that legend a little more.”-kaladin to lezian"" when the final node is found, and kaladin and company make preparations, kaladin and teft realize that like the last two times, the pursuer would be waiting for him with a trap ready. meanwhile, raboniel, who has sent the pursuer to break the node, suspects he is deliberately stalling to lure kaladin, and sends vyre out to do the task. as kaladin approaches what he expects to be a trap, he sees the pursuer sitting in the center of the atrium waiting for him, and engages. their contest quickly takes centerstage, and even the heavenly ones descend to watch. like before, lezian immediately drops his body as his first husk, streaking forward in ribbon form to grapple with his opponent. kaladin expects this and drops his spear, catching lezian's wrists as he manifests a body, willingly entering the grapple. lezian manages to hook kaladin's foot and shove him to the ground, but kaladin is able to pull him down with him. as before, lezian taunts him, but this time, kaladin correctly surmises that the most important thing to lezian is his legend, and that each time he loses to kaladin, that legend dies a little bit more. he then uses navani's fabrial, which he has shifted around from a glove to a belt, to break the wrestle. the sibling's restoration[edit] ""“you’re no soldier. that’s what i realized about you, defeated one. you’ve never faced death.”-kaladin to lezian"" as kaladin and lezian wrestled, the singers cleared the atrium of civilians. the shanay-im floating and watching from the air, and the crowds watching from the upper balconies, the atrium is effectively turned into an improptu arena between kaladin and lezian. lezian begins this second round of their fight by lunging for kaladin, who immediately engages his fabrial to pull back and stay out of range. lezian, who begins to understand the stakes of this contest, wants to end it quickly, and drops his second body, shooting towards kaladin as a ribbon. they wrestle again as lezian materializes his third body, and kaladin tries to use a knife to wound lezian, as before hoping to force lezian to spend his precious voidlight healing. lezian, who is taking this contest extremely seriously, manages to make kaladin drop his knife. but kaladin continues to goad him, declaring that lezian is no soldier, not having faced death as frequently as kaladin as has. as he takes the upper hand, he further taunts him by saying that thousands of years of life have not prepared lezian to face someone like kaladin, who doesn't fear him. and as kaladin pulls out a second knife from his boot, lezian, thrown off his game, drops his third body, streaking out as a ribbon and manifesting his fourth and final one, in which he is vulnerable. kaladin declares him ""the defeated one."" lezian realizes just how visible this contest is, and how many people are watching. he sees his own legend, his own lore and reputation begin to crumble, and hums to an increasingly panicked rhythm. as kaladin begins walking forward, lezian stumbles back into his own soldiers holding the perimeter. kaladin unhooks navani's fabrial from his belt, and goads lezian, who charges him. kaladin simply presses navani's fabrial device to lezian's chest, and locks it on with a lashing, launching him backwards. he hits the glass window of the atrium and cracks his carapace, but is unable to heal himself as he lacks the voidlight to do so. as kaladin stalks forward, repeatedly and powerfully commanding him to flee, lezian, dripping blood from his wounds, loses his resolve and runs away. kaladin notes that everyone present and watching understood that while lezian had retreated from battles before, it meant something more, something different this time. in running from kaladin, lezian's title was broken, and he was no longer the pursuer. after moash has broken kaladin's resolve by showing him a dead teft, he grabs a gagged and bound lirin, and waits for lezian, who arrives as a shameful ribbon. as he materialized a body, moash hands him lirin, and commands him to kill him if kaladin regains his senses. lezian doesn't quite want to accept it, as he wants to go kill kaladin immediately, but folds for the time being, as moash explains to him what will happen should he interfere with kaladin grieving. ""“my legacy is untouched! and this is complete madness! i will prove myself and continue my tradition!”-lezian"" lezian is restless regardless. he hands lirin over to leshwi, and as she cuts away his bonds, berates her for trying to turn the nine against him, saying she wants to destroy his legacy. leshwi argues that his legacy is already dead, and that it died the moment he ran from kaladin. this enrages lezian, and he loudly declares that his legacy is untouched, and that he can prove it, as he drops his first body as a husk and streaks as a ribbon towards kaladin. he materializes his second body just above him, and breaks off a spur off his elbow to stab him. however, the moment he touches kaladin's shoulder to lift him up and stab him, he howls with pain, then grabs lezian's arm and turns and twists, ending up behind him. kaladin pulls out a knife and stabs lezian through the throat, which he barely manages to avoid by ejecting from his own body, barely in time. he quickly reforms into his third body and tries to wrestle with kaladin again, but is completely outclassed at this point, getting stabbed first through the arm, and then almost getting stabbed in the face. lezian has to eject again, dropping his third body. he materializes into his final body right next to his soldiers, and commands them to kill kaladin, and then the other radiants. he then charges kaladin, and his soldiers seemingly follow, but shy away from kaladin and his glowing yellow-red eyes, leaving lezian to fight him alone. lezian, who at this point has to engage kaladin or lose any chance at salvaging any of his reputation, meets kaladin in front of the massive window of the urithiru atrium. as he tries to grapple kaladin, the latter simply turns and folds into it, and then slams them both against the window. he then manages to bind lezian (who is in his final, fourth body, and is thus unable to drop it) to the window with a full lashing, leaving him stuck there. kaladin then reverse lashes lezian's head to the floor, making it pull towards the ground. between these two opposing forces, lezian is literally ripped apart, as kaladin turns and walks away from him. aftermath of the occupation[edit] when lezian returns after this death, el annihilates him with a dagger charged with anti-voidlight in order to test whether the inverse light functions as raboniel theorized. it does, and lezian permanently dies. notes[edit]"
Mesh,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Mesh,"mesh is a squadleader in brightlord meridas amaram's army. history[edit] during one of amaram's battles, kaladin stormblessed ended up reinforcing mesh's squad while trying to find his brother, tien. mesh had lost a lot of men in that battle and was having difficulty holding his position. the enemy army was coming in a pincer formation at his squad from the south and the east, but he and his neighboring squadleader, varth, were told by a messenger that they were to only hold against an east assault. kaladin caught sight of tien in varth's squad and abandoned his position in the line just as the enemy troops reached them. already lacking in reinforcements, this additional weakness in the lines caused mesh's squad to crumple under the enemy assault, falling apart and losing their discipline immediately. it is unknown if mesh himself survived the battle. notes[edit]"

Reshi Isles,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Reshi_Isles,"the reshi isles are a collection of islands on the northern edge of roshar in the reshi sea. people from the reshi isles are called reshi. they include the islands of kadrix, quili, abri, arak and sumi. according to dalinar's memories the people of the akak reshi were destroyed. one of the smaller islands is home to the ardents geranid and her husband ashir. geography[edit] climate[edit] the weather of the reshi isles is warm and overwhelmingly humid. the rainfall on the reshi sea often forms a misting haze. the summers tend to be sweltering, especially at the beaches, where the sand is heated enough that it hurts to walk across. lifeforms[edit] ""“shalebark mounds made vast fields of vibrant colors. moss coated nearly everything. vines and rockbuds wound around trunks of small trees that had gained a foothold in cracks between plates of the animal’s shell.”-rysn describing a tai-na."" - - a type of tree with bark of stone which grows along the bottom of the reshi sea. - - a type of island-sized habitable - worshiped by the reshi. - - a fearsome creature that is hunted in the reshi isles. - - the zatalef is a cephalopod that lives at least in akak, and perhaps in other reshi isles. - an unknown species of minnow. - an unknown species of - living on - . people[edit] the reshi are described as having black hair, tan skin and rounded features. they speak reshi, which is a language sounding like barking, according to some people. they are a relaxed people, living a simple life, though not every reshi is carefree and prefers lounging to fighting. they know much of foreigners, but are not aware of the current economic situation on the mainland, so they only trade with people they trust and respect during the trading season. with outsiders seeking out the place and trying to exploit them, they grow tired of those who bring goods of low quality. despite this, they are capable of sending messages to distant locations, as talik was able to tell vstim in advance that he should bring goods to trade for a larkin corpse. the relatively relaxed culture of the reshi isles attracts foreigners to the isles as permanent residents. according to vstim, relocating to the tai-na called relu-na requires giving all you own to their king. it is unclear if this is standard practice for all of the reshi isles, or just for this one. as indigenous populations, most reshi have no real concept of assassination and war. to them, battle is more about yelling and posturing than actual killing. however the eastern reshi often raid alethkar. when trading, a reshi judges the other trader as they would judge a rival in battle. when a foreigner is nearby, the reshi always jump into the water from greater heights, doing so to impress and shock these foreigners. culture[edit] religion[edit] the reshi worship tai-na as their gods. they believe that the tai-na approve of boldness and respect and interpret the movements of the tai-na as divine will. they also believe that everything in life serves the same purpose of pleasing the tai-na they use bundles of fruit as offerings. they appear to observe taboos of some sort regarding discussion of the spren that inhabit tai-na, as axies the collector warns rysn not to ""ask about the soul of their god."" clothing[edit] reshi standard clothing includes colorful wraps leaving the shoulders bare as well as tassels. some reshi also wear their hair in braids. reshi are also known to wear hair ornaments such as ribbons. swimmers like to walk about unclothed. in parts of the reshi isles, some women don't even wear tops due to the hot weather. the king of an island is dressed in full bright voluminous robes. live stock[edit] the reshi paint their chulls' shells. one can identify what island a reshi chull handler is from by the colors and patterns on their chulls' shells. the reshi on kadrix ride greatshells. furniture[edit] all the reshi furniture is flat and long. there are no chairs, just cushions. military[edit] ""“soldiers lined the path, armed with spears bearing colorful tassels. their breastplates and armguards were of carapace carved wickedly with points, and though they wore only wraps for clothing, they stood as stiff backed as any alethi soldier, with stern expressions to match.”-rysn observing reshi guards."" though many reshi are relaxed and carefree, there are those who prefer fighting to lounging. these soldiers wear armour made from carapace, their armguards are carved into wicked points. they also carry spears with tassels on them. they do not have any shards and are not known to have any soulcasters. in large parts of the reshi isles the fighting is ritualistic, with more posturing and yelling then actual killing, the eastern reshi are known for their raids against the alethi however, so its safe to assume these reshi fight more like warriors from the mainland. reshi wars are often short, only a single battle long.[citation needed] when two tai-na go to war the people of the islands get into boats and exchange insults and boasts, each starting with their weakest insults first. this would progress into a kind of verbal duel ending with the strongest insults. afterwards arrows and spears would be exchanged, although this wouldn’t be to violently, with more yelling then actual cutting.[citation needed] transportation[edit] the reshi travel the reshi sea using catamarans.[citation needed] they also travel on their islands using chulls.[citation needed] politics[edit] the reshi isles are not united by a single government, instead each island has its own king.[citation needed] a reshi leader is called a king, regardless of gender. history[edit] rishir[edit] rishir was one of the silver kingdoms on roshar. it was created during the heraldic epochs. the largest area claimed by rishir consisted of the reshi isles. the oathgate was established at the city of kurth, on the border of the reshi sea. eventually at an unknown date the kingdom collapsed and fractured into multiple other nations.[citation needed] saving the larkin[edit] at some point after the scouring of aimia a group of tai-na known as the na-alind took in the larkin, as of 1174, they are still protecting the larkin.[citation needed] the akak reshi[edit] the akak reshi fought a war with the alethi around the year 1155. they eventually lost this war and were destroyed. dalinar fought as general on the alethi side and claimed the land for alethkar.[citation needed] the wastescum skirmishes[edit] the wastescum skirmishes are a collection of skirmishes in the northern region of alethkar which occurred some time before 1166, and some time after the crowning of gavilar in 1145. the skirmishes were started by reshi raiders raiding northern alethkar, seeking to take advantage of the instability of alethkar soon after the crowning of gavilar kholin. it can be reasonably assumed that the raiders were repelled from alethkar.[citation needed] this conflict did not fully dissuade the reshi from engaging in border skirmishes but combined with the destruction of the akak reshi it dealt a heavy blow to the nearby reshi. nevertheless they are still known to attack alethkar as late as kak 1173.[citation needed] the coalition[edit] the coalition invited the reshi king ral-na and his son

Midpeace,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Midpeace,"midpeace is a period that marks the middle of the rosharan year. the rosharan year is 500 days long and ends with a four week period of rain known as the weeping. midpeace occurs at the midpoint between weepings. highstorms occur more frequently as midpeace approaches and after it ends, but they do not occur at all during midpeace. although the exact duration of midpeace is not mentioned, it is the longest sustained period on roshar without rain; since ""natural"" storms that are not highstorms or the everstorm are rare, many rivers typically dry up by the end of midpeace. residents of roshar use the fair weather of midpeace to celebrate and travel. alethkar, jah keved, and possibly other nations hold outdoor festivals known as middlefest fairs. yokska mentions traveling to liafor during midpeace to see the latest fashion trends. notes[edit]"
Rial,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rial,"rial is a sergeant in bridge thirteen on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] he is clean-shaven with dark brown hair, and dalinar notes that he is a bit pale for an alethi. however, he is later referred to as having leathery, dark skin.[fn 1] he speaks with a slow koron drawl that originates from central alethkar near the sunmaker mountains. he has a habit of rolling a sphere across his knuckles; he also formally salutes dalinar constantly. he typically carries a flask of alcohol on his person. navani considers him ""greasy"", but dalinar likes him because he considers him similar to some of his friends from the ""old days"", referring to his time spent as a warlord. attributes and abilities[edit] rial was a member of bridge thirteen when they became teft's windrunner squires. rial and the rest of the crew presumably gained limited surgebinding abilities when they are within thirty miles of teft, including healing powers and flight through the use of basic lashings. history[edit] rial's past is unknown, including the reason that he was part of a bridge crew. some time after the battle of narak, rial and the rest of bridge thirteen were assigned to be bodyguards for the leadership in urithiru after the members of bridge four became kaladin's squires. he quickly became friendly with dalinar and at one point spiked his canteen with alcohol. he guarded dalinar on his first trip to thaylen city and was present during dalinar's duel with kdralk. he later offered dalinar some alcohol just prior to him being branded a heretic by the curates of the holy enclave. rial was aware that navani sent dalinar a special timekeeping vambrace even before dalinar opened the package. rial was not available to guard dalinar during the battle of thaylen field after teft became a knight radiant and the members of bridge thirteen become his squires. trivia[edit] - rial's unusual accent and behavior, inconsistent appearance, mysterious past, and sudden proximity to dalinar have led some readers to speculate that he is not a simple alethi bridgeman and may be a - . however, - has - ’d questions about him. notes[edit]"
Sea of Oracles,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sea_of_Oracles,"the sea of oracles is a region of the sea of lost lights. it is north of celebrant, emberdark, and the burning gardens. to the south, it is bordered with the glasswater deep. the salavashi trench is a portion of the sea of oracles. in the physical realm, the sea of oracles corresponds to at least parts of alethkar north of the deathbend river. it is also north of the tarat sea, so it seems the sea of oracles goes into jah keved. the sea's western boundary is unclear. notes[edit]"
Sea of Lost Lights,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sea_of_Lost_Lights,"""“ the sea of beads rolling against itself began to sound soothing. even rhythmic. ”- adolin watching the sea of lost lights"" the sea of lost lights is a large sea in eastern shadesmar, the subastral of roshar. the origin of its name is unknown. geography[edit] the sea of lost lights lies in the region of shadesmar corresponding to the physical nations of alethkar, jah keved, and herdaz, as well as the frostlands, unclaimed hills, and thaylenah. to the west, it flows into the sea of souls; to the east, it reaches the shores of the expanse of the broken sky and expanse of the vapors. a stretch of land separates it from thaylen sea, the cognitive representation of the island of thaylenah. topographical features[edit] like all ""seas"" in shadesmar, the sea of lost lights isn't filled with water, but rather small beads that represent the various cognitive aspects of physical objects. there are no winds in shadesmar, and the only known weather phenomenas are the highstorm and the strips of clouds common to the subastral. nonetheless, the sea roils and the beads constantly move and clack against each other. the sea of lost lights has numerous peninsulas, corresponding to physical rivers, and several small islands, equivalent to lakes. the land is made from a material akin to dark glass or obsidian. channels are occasionally cut through the peninsulas to make sea travel easier. many of these channels are cut through the peninsulas that represent the deathbend river. ecology[edit] there is a variety of plant life in shadesmar, which, like in the physical realm, appears to differ based on region. in the northern section of the sea of lost lights, fernlike plants and mushroom-like trees can be found growing along the peninsula shorelines that reflect rivers in alethkar.further south, a jungle made of black trees with multicolored leaves, red trees that end in minerals, and moss, can be found on the island representing the longbrow's straits. along the southern edge of the sea of lost lights, there are crystal trees with spikey limbs and no leaves. a fairly sizeable population of non-sapient spren that live within the ocean of beads. notable locations[edit] true spren live in a number of cities and other settlements within shadesmar. the sea of lost lights includes the following settlements; history[edit] at some point in recent past, honorspren attempted to conquer all of shadesmar, including the sea of lost lights. the attempt left them with a poor reputation among other sapient spren. for this reason, they are rare in places like celebrant, although their warships still sail there. at the beginning of the true desolation, many cities in the sea of lost lights were taken over by the fused, although they ruled rather lightly, save for occasionally setting things on fire. after being transported to shadesmar through the corrupted kholinar oathgate, shallan, kaladin, and their spren, as well as adolin and azure, got trapped in the sea of lost lights. they traveled to riino's lighthouse, where they managed to find passage to celebrant on a ship crewed by reachers and pulled by mandra. there, they were chased by the fused and ended up taking refuge on the honorspren ship honor's path. when the fused were seen chasing the ship, the humans and their spren escaped, before traveling over the island that represented longbrow's straits to reach thaylen city. at some point around 1175 the ghostbloods created a shipping route through the sea of lost lights with the intent to move investiture through the area. notes[edit]"

Ghostbloods,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ghostblood,"the ghostbloods are a secret organization found on many planets in the cosmere, formed for the purposes of protecting scadrial from all threats. members are required to get a tattoo of three overlapping diamonds somewhere on their bodies. the symbol bears a resemblance to the three-petal shape of marewill flowers. tenets[edit] they have three general tenets: - protecting scadrial. - sharing what they know with each other, but not with others. - trusting each other. objectives[edit] scadrian ghostbloods[edit] the scadrian ghostbloods are devoted to protecting scadrial at any cost, and due to this came into conflict with the set and autonomy. rosharan ghostbloods[edit] ""“power, portable, easily contained, renewable. you hold the energy of a storm in your hand, veil. that raw energy, plucked from the heart of the raging tempest. it is tamed-not only a safe source of light, but of power that those with … particular interests and abilities can access.”-mraize to shallan"" the rosharan ghostbloods seek power. they are seeking a way to get stormlight (investiture) offworld from roshar through shadesmar. they hunt restares and the sons of honor as they fear they are close to discovering the secret of making this possible. stormlight is free, portable, easy-to-access power. to attain this goal, they need control of the oathgates, which inspired their hunt for urithiru. they seek perfect gemstones that would allow the stormlight to last long enough to get offworld, though there is a connection problem. the ghostbloods are obsessed with finding ba-ado-mishram, who has the ability to bind minds of an entire people, though it is unclear the reason. they are not interested in seeing odium rule roshar. they seek to bond sja-anat, as her ancient knowledge would be invaluable. they also seek to imprison heralds in gemstones, in order to obtain information. thaidakar seeks knowledge about an affliction he shares with the heralds, in order to save himself. their desire to find a way to carry stormlight off-world, and to help thaidakar learn how to leave scadrial, likely ties into the ghostblood's goal of protecting scadrial. the scadrian ghostbloods, however, seem to see them as running amok. resources[edit] the ghostbloods own a tenement building in highprince sebarial's warcamp on the shattered plains that has a basement. in it there was a display of trophies that shallan saw, including several enormous gemhearts, a tusk was probably from a whitespine, an eye socket that looked like the structure of a santhid’s skull, a vial of pale sand, a couple of thick hairpins, a lock of golden hair, a yolish branch of a tree with writing on it, a silver knife, an odd flower preserved in some kind of solution, and a chunk of pale pink crystal that looked like it might be some kind of gemstone. there were also shells that shallan vaguely recognized. there were no plaques describing any of these mementos. on scadrial, they have a safehouse at house one eighty-seven, near thirty-third and finete in the the knightbridge district of bilming. it is protected with identity locks and contains maps, a seon, an armory, and three jars of purified dor in a safe with an awakened lock. they also own a large estate in elendel. structure[edit] the ghostbloods operate across multiple planets within the cosmere. they operate within a strict hierarchy, as a group of hunters without structure would turn on each other too easily. they do not strike against their own. they do not negotiate upward. it is common for a master to spy on their pupils. ialai sadeas warns shallan that the ghostbloods will watch her to ensure she doesn't rise high enough to learn secrets that could hurt them. joining the ghostbloods requires being brought in by a member of the organization, and the swearing of oaths to the ghostbloods. it is tradition for the one who offers membership to become the mentor of the one they invited. upon joining the ghostbloods, they share everything they know and the member can influence decisions. the ghostbloods do not keep secrets from fellow members, but in most cases members are also not allowed to share ghostblood secrets with non-members. mraize warned shallan that if she were to break ties with the group, she would be hunted. he and his babsk would not hunt her, but all they could do was discourage others. members are not to share secret information with anyone outside of the organization, doing so would result in the assassination of the offender, due to the danger it can pose to the organization. thaidakar is not on roshar and only comes as what they consider an avatar; he does show up directly to the scadrian ghostbloods. thaidakar does affect the rosharan ghostbloods' actions, but they are a little removed from him on roshar. notable members[edit] - : leader of the ghostbloods, referred to as the survivor by the inhabitants of scadrial and as thaidakar by the inhabitants of roshar. rosharan chapter[edit] - : a high-ranking member, the pupil of thaidakar, purports to be mraize's master, a worldhopper - : a high-ranking member, the student of iyatil, a worldhopper - : under the alias of ""veil"" (formerly) - : a golden-haired man - : a member of the - ardentia (deceased) - : shallan's father (deceased) - : the davar family's steward (deceased) - unnamed - : used a pen-shaped - to spy on scadrian chapter[edit] - : a student of thaidakar, based in - , considered his best agent - : a member based in - : a member based in - : a member based in - and brother of - : a member based in elendel, an important chemist who assists in the production of the ghostblood's aluminum. actions[edit] attempted murder of jasnah kholin[edit] the ghostbloods have made several attempts to murder jasnah kholin, and claims that she has had a number of their members assassinated as well. when jasnah spent time in kharbranth to study the voidbringers, a ghostblood agent named kabsal infiltrated the local ardentia in order to kill jasnah. he used her young ward shallan davar to get close to jasnah, which led to them forming a relationship. as kabsal attempted to poison jasnah with bread, he was inadvertently killed when he ate some of the poisoned bread and jasnah soulcast his antidote, mistakenly believing that to be the poison. jasnah later found the ghostblood tattoo on kabsal's arm. when jasnah left kharbranth, the ghostbloods planted at least one operative aboard the ship wind's pleasure on the journey from kharbranth to the shattered plains. that operative, along with other men shallan did not recognize, attempted to murder jasnah. they thought they'd succeeded, but in reality, jasnah had escaped to shadesmar by elsecalling. jasnah assumes that she was targeted because of her radiant oaths. recruiting shallan davar[edit] a man identified with the ghostbloods was financing lin davar in his bid to become highprince of veden, jah keved. after an unknown veden shardbearer attacked amaram, amaram speculated that thaidakar and the ghostbloods were behind the attack. the unknown shardbearer turned out to be helaran davar, shallan's brother. the ghostbloods were sought out by shallan davar, who, under the disguise of veil, wanted to investigate them. shallan met with mraize and iyatil in a ghostblood hideout located in sebarial's warcamp, and managed to trick them into believing that she was sent there by tyn. mraize, unaware that tyn was dead, ordered shallan to tell tyn to investigate the quarters of meridas amaram. shallan successfully performed this task, and brought her findings to mraize, which led to her accidentally revealing her photographic memory. mraize then deduced that tyn was dead, killed by shallan, but commended her for it. he then told her that she could get a place among the ghostbloods if she completed tasks for them. however, he also allowed other ghostbloods to attempt to murder her if they wanted to. shallan managed to avoid the attempts on her life, and carried out her next task, to investigate taln's presence in the warcamp of dalinar kholin, to a satisfactory manner. after the battle of narak, and the subsequent discovery of urithiru, mraize confronted shallan, and revealed that he had figured out her real identity as lin davar's daughter, jasnah kholin's ward, and a knight radiant with the ability to soulcast. mraize reminded her of her family's debt to the ghostbloods, and also revealed that ghostblood agents had rescued her brothers from the civil war in jah keved, and would bring them safely to urithiru. the ghostblood operatives succeeded, and the davar brothers arrived in urithiru after the battle of thaylen fields. shallan's identities debated their interest in joining the ghostbloods. veil was interested in joining, but refused to get the tattoo. shallan planned to break ties with the ghostbloods. formless, an imagined fourth identity for shallan where she hid her self doubt and selfish ambitions, wanted to join the ghostbloods. mraize offered shallan full membership in the ghostbloods in return for assassinating restares, leader of the sons of honor. shallan did not go through with it and broke ties with the group. she threatened mraize to leave urithiru and warned him that she would be hunting for ba-ado-mishram. mraize warned her that she'd moved against the group in the most offensive of ways. ""“this will not end well for you, shallan. you make an enemy of the most powerful organization in all the cosmere. ”-mraize to shallan"" cleansing urithiru[edit] mraize asked shallan to investigate the wrongness in urithiru, which she was already sensing. this led her to find, confront, and expel re-shephir. pursuit of the sons of honor[edit] the ghostbloods wished to keep an eye on the activities of house sadeas, and mraize was personally spying on them, acting as a guard to ialai sadeas in urithiru. they murdered thanadal and vamah. they struck at ialai several times and ultimately succeeded when shallan assassinated her with blackbane, though shallan claimed she did this for the good of alethkar. shallan and the unseen court searched ialai's bed chambers and found a notebook containing many ghostblood secrets, including a map of shadesmar, a route through the sea of lost lights, and thaidakar's supposed offworld origins. shallan hunted restares to lasting integrity. restares was an alias for the herald kalak. after an internal struggle, shallan decided against killing him. she offered to share information about the ghostbloods. he claimed to be close to getting offworld. recruiting sja-anat[edit] during her wedding, shallan is instructed in a letter from mraize to recruit sja-anat into the ghostbloods. mraize requested a bond between a ghostblood and one of her ""enlightened"" spren. shallan only arranged a meeting. sja-anat sent tumi, who ended up bonding rlain. bringing other forms of investiture to roshar[edit] the ghostbloods have plans to commercialize investiture on a much larger scale than what happened on scadrial. in these efforts they bring sand from taldain, seons from sel, and aviars from first of the sun to roshar. they want to use the oathgates to facilitate the trade of these items on roshar, as they would not need to rely on perpendicularities. mraize also mentions that perfect gemstones would be a good tool for carrying stormlight off roshar; jasnah has noted that there are nowhere near as many perfect gemstones in circulation as there should be, which leads adolin to theorize that a group that is aware of their importance-like the ghostbloods-has been secretly collecting them. the honorspren of lasting integrity have collected several perfect gemstones over millennia, though it is unclear how many they have compared to how many jasnah thinks there should be. resistance against trell[edit] the ghostbloods on scadrial worked in order to resist the oncoming threat of trell. at 348 pc the ghostbloods attempted to recruit marasi colms and sent moonlight to deliver a message to her telling that the ghostbloods were watching her and were impressed. several days later the ghostbloods contacted kelsier via seon in their hideout in bilming informing him that the set had developed a bomb to destroy elendel. after kelsier informed the ghostbloods that he wouldn't get to bilming in time, twinsoul, moonlight and marasi discovered and infiltrated the set's underground caverns. since moonlight and marasi were discovered and confronted by set soldiers after marasi's attempt to save a group of people from execution, moonlight used a soulstamp to rewrite her history and become an elantrian so marasi could escape.. ghostblood agents in elendel were ordered to assist the local authorities with organising the evacuation, as they too would not reach bilming in time. after wax and wayne stopped the bomb that the set sent to elendel, marasi met with kelsier and the ghostbloods in elendel and told them that she wouldn't join with them, because of their rule of keeping their information secret. after that twinsoul supposedly went on a mission to track down moonlight. trivia[edit] - the name of the ghostbloods means something, and has roots in specific - events. - the ghostbloods would actively recruit from the - , particularly from their field agents. - they are not working together with the seventeenth shard. - the ghostbloods find - intriguing. - the ghostbloods do not trust the - . they are worried about having their organization taken over. - the - will be subtitled 'ghostbloods'. notes[edit]"
Mishinah Bethab,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Mishinah_Bethab,"mishinah bethab is a lighteyed member of the alethi nobility on roshar. she is married to highprince bethab. appearance and personality[edit] she is mousy, and has orange eyes with a pinched face. she is skilled at navigating alethi politics. history[edit] mishinah's history is not known, but bethab married her for her political acumen. she often attended political meetings in lieu of her husband. at the end of the war of reckoning, mishinah-not bethab himself-informed dalinar that house bethab would not join his assault on the parshendi. although some of bethab's soldiers did not respect this arrangement, it generally benefited house bethab. after the battle of narak and the activation of the oathgates, she was seen at a meeting of alethi nobility in urithiru. mishinah and several highprinces had concerns about providing basic services (such as food, water, and plumbing) to the many new citizens of urithiru, but navani kholin was able to quell their fears. mishinah's questions also implied that she was concerned about navani seizing power in dalinar's absence when he temporarily fled to vedenar. mishinah and her husband eventually came to support dalinar and the coalition of monarchs. they were sent to thaylen city as ambassadors, and mishinah's political skills proved to be useful. notes[edit]"
Karanak,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Karanak,"karanak is a city in southern alethkar in bethab princedom. it sits near mevan bay and the delta where the deathbend river meets the tarat sea. in the year following the battle of thaylen field, coalition forces took control of southwestern alethkar along the coast of the tarat sea. karanak was under coalition control at the time of taravangian's betrayal and coalition forces in southern alethkar successfully regrouped at the city with minimal casualties. notes[edit]"
Tomat,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tomat,"tomat is a city in the sadeas princedom of alethkar on roshar. geography[edit] tomat is located in northwestern alethkar, near the intersection of the borders of alethkar, jah keved, and herdaz. it is situated at the southwestern point of the sadeas princedom, just north of the vamah princedom. it lies on a large river that originates in the sunmaker mountains and defines portions of jah keved's borders with alethkar and herdaz before emptying into a herdazian bay near the reshi isles. landmarks[edit] the gap[edit] tomat has a city wall, but at the time of the true desolation it had been broken for several generations, with the resulting gap becoming infamous among its citizens. history[edit] tomat was one of the cities that was occupied by singers during the invasion of alethkar by odium's forces that began in 1174. although the city had a defensive wall, it had been broken by unknown means several generations before the true desolation. the residents of the city offered little resistance to the invading army. in 1175, the coalition of monarchs sent scouts on reconnaissance missions throughout alethkar. kara observed the area that included tomat, taking notes on singer troop placement and the condition of the buildings. she reported that the city was in good shape, likely owing to the fact that they had quickly surrendered. she also noted that the singers had started to repair the city wall. notable residents[edit] hesina had particular interest in reading kara's notes on tomat. she had a conversation with lirin indicating that her father lived in the city and owned a business there. hesina worried that her father's obstinate personality might have led him to resist the singers even if the rest of the town surrendered. notes[edit]"
Hornhollow,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Hornhollow,"hornhollow is a village in sadeas princedom close to hearthstone. it is part of the akanny region - a prized farming area that supplies grain, meat and other provisions for large portions of alethkar. hornhollow would be considered a fairly large town by the local standards and has a small militia. it resides on the highprince's lands and the surrounding area is worked by high ranking darkeyes. the village lies in a depression, protected from the highstorm by a large hill to the east. within the town are approximately two dozen structures, including two storm sanctuaries that can be used by passing travellers to shelter from the storms. there are also many structures nearby that don't reside within the village proper. in the centre of the town is a cistern used to collect and filter rainwater. history[edit] kaladin visited the town after leaving hearthstone and discovered that one of the village's grain stores had been attacked by the runaway singers. the villagers had been expecting kaladin and were prepared for his arrival, hoping for information and the chance to increase their riches. the brightlord of the town was disappointed when he was unable to trade two dun chips for one full of stormlight as some of the previous villages had been able too. one of the village ardents estimated that the town's grain supplies were attacked by approximately fifty singers, who left very little behind. the amount of grain lost should have been able to sustain the village through until the next harvest. the villagers reported seeing a number of strange red lights, but were unsure as to whether these lights were coming from the singer's eyes or from another source. the village trapper, reported to kaladin that the group of singers had been heading towards kholinar after they left hornhollow. notes[edit]"

through his power. i'm still learning. we all are. the book of endless pages cannot be filled ... though your father made a very nice addition to the text."" ”-godeke to adolin kholin"" godeke is an edgedancer on roshar who used to be an ardent. appearance and personality[edit] godeke is a thin man on the short side, with a gaunt face, short cropped hair and a square beard still maintained in a style akin to an ardent's. he's a scholarly and curious man, packing books with him for the trip to shadesmar and rejoicing at the chance to explore the cognitive realm as a beauty made by the almighty. he tends to have a positive outlook, but also tends towards solemnity. attributes and abilities[edit] surgebinding[edit] godeke is an edgedancer and as such has access to the surges of abrasion and progression. history[edit] godeke used to be an ardent before his bond was formed and he joined the radiant forces in urithiru. he states he used to be ""deformed"" all his life, and his nahel bond allowed him to heal and become as he has always seen himself. his reference to the book of endless pages could possibly indicate he belonged to the devotary of sincerity. his bonded a cultivationspren named archinal, who presents in the cognitive realm as a short woman in robes, made entirely of vines and crystal. he claims to have had some experience in matters of diplomacy. he speaks thaylen as well as alethi. the evacuation of hearthstone[edit] godeke was one of the edgedancers brought with the fourth bridge to help evacuate the civilians and heal the battling radiants in hearthstone. he was guiding a group of refuges to the airship when leshwi flew by closely being followed by kaladin. the shardblade of the edgedancer almost hit her but only sliced her robes. later, he went with roshone to the manor to help free the people trapped in the burning building. in the manor he was taken hostage by a fused who took him out to use as bait. when kaladin entered the building, he found godeke injured severely by a fused who slashed his stomach, and the new surge-cancelling fabrial in effect, prevented the edgedancer from healing with his stormlight. after kaladin fought the present fused and singers and disabled the device, he ordered lift to evacuate the slowly-healing godeke. mission to shadesmar[edit] godeke is part of a group of edgedancers attending one of the meetings of the coalition. a proposal was brought up to send an envoy to the honorspren to persuade them to bond more radiants. when dalinar suggested sending an edgedancer, lift volunteered first. the rulers were not comfortable with that, and when dalinar suggested they send someone with practice as a diplomat, godeke spoke up that he could try and had some experience with these kind of things. he would be joined by adolin, shallan, a truthwatcher and stoneward. the expedition was gathering near the oathgate platform. when approaching, godeke noticed adolin packing his horse and asked him how many swords he needed. the highprince replied you could never have too many and proceeded to show of his collection. godeke quickly extracted himself from the exchange and hurried along. the group went to shadesmar and started hiking down from the oathgate to sea level. at some point, adolin came walking beside godeke, who expressed wonder at all the works of the almighty they could now see. the former ardent thanked the highprince for taking him on the expedition. they proceeded to talk about vorinism and how godeke believed honor was just an aspect of the almighty, and as such the almighty could not die. when dalinar came up he called him a holy man, and so it was fine for him to write. godeke compared dalinar's vibrant transformation to his own smaller transformation when his deformity was healed. when after sailing for weeks they finally sighted land, godeke was eager to leave the ship. the lightweavers went ahead to scout, while godeke and adolin discussed how the stormlight in even their biggest gems had started to fade. the highprince asked godeke to take their last stormlight into town and trade it for supplies. after going into the town, godeke came searching for adolin to get him to look at a group of humans. together they went to check them out. they found a caravan of what appeared to be tukari. they tried to talk to them in various languages, with godeke speaking thaylen. the caravan responded in a hostile way, and the edgedancer concluded they were tukari indeed. later the radiants and their spren discussed how to approach the honorspren. godeke agreed with the stump that trying to guilt them into helping would not work, nor would threats. the group could not come up with a better alternative. later godeke was scouting ahead with his spren, he had practiced during his radiant training. after a break, adolin suddenly realized the tukari were not following the expedition, but notum the honorspren. the highprince ran to the rescue and godeke and the others marched after him as fast as they could. after adolin's fight, godeke inspected the prince's side wound and bound it, as they had no stormlight left to heal with. before they left, the edgedancer went among the fallen and memorized their faces. when the group reached lasting integrity, godeke joined the others in objecting to adolin's plan to stand trial. after adolin's capture in lasting integrity, godeke camped near the city with felt and malli to await the results, while the rest of the expedition had gone back to tell dalinar what had happened. the edgedancer had been allowed into the city just to heal adolin. the communicated via letters, and informed adolin when notum had returned to patrolling. trivia[edit] - godeke is based on steve godecke, one of the

Ral-na,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ral-na,"ral-na is the king of the community that resides on relu-na, a greatshell island in the reshi sea on roshar. he is also a dustbringer and is bonded to an ashspren. appearance and personality[edit] ral-na has dark eyes and graying hair. he prefers to wear voluminous, brightly colored robes. he is a transgender man, and his bond with an ashspren allowed him to heal his body to match his true gender. before transitioning, he looked like a middle-aged woman. after transitioning, he is a short man with strong pectoral muscles. he speaks the reshi language, and is usually soft-spoken when outsiders are present. he seems to have a calm demeanor, but he can be forceful if needed. attributes and abilities[edit] kingship[edit] ral-na is the king of relu-na, a tai-na the size of an island that slowly moves about in the reshi sea. as the king, anyone who wants to join the island permanently has to give everything they own to him. his commands are to be obeyed without question, and he is directly served by various workers and guards. the island's soldiers are well-trained, in contrast to the carefree lifestyle enjoyed by many of the residents. he also negotiates trade deals for the people, but uses his son talik as an intermediary and an interpreter. ral-na is well respected by his subjects; they have full respect for his authority. it is not known if ral-na inherited the title of king or if the reshi have some other method of succession. ral-na holds court at the top of relu-na's shell near its head, hundreds of feet above the water. he only leaves the island in truly extraordinary circumstances. the king supervises offerings of fruit to relu-na, who is worshipped as a god by its residents. the reshi people believe that they can communicate with their tai-na, and each greatshell's will is the only authority that exceeds that of their kings. the tai-na also provide the reshi people with an unusually high level of knowledge regarding aimia and larkin. surgebinding[edit] ral-na has formed a nahel bond with an unknown ashspren, which grants him the ability to surgebind. when he formed the bond, his body healed to match his gender identity. although he is not known to have formally joined the knights radiant organization, his powers are those of the order of dustbringers, with the ability to manipulate the surges of division and abrasion. members of this order are relatively rare among the refounded radiants. history[edit] ral-na recalled vstim visiting relu-na in his youth. in order to earn the people's respect so that they would trade with him, he slayed a coracot, an incredible feat for a foreigner. vstim later served as talik's babsk when ral-na and his partner sent the young reshi to train in thaylenah. trade with rysn[edit] circa 1173, vstim brought rysn to relu-na to negotiate a trade deal. at the time, ral-na had not physically transitioned; his use of ""king"" as his title confused rysn even though talik told her it was perfectly normal. rysn was unaware of vstim's prior history with ral-na and talik; the trade deal was a setup intended to help teach rysn how to negotiate on her own. vstim feigned sickness and talik was in on the ruse; ral-na was presumably aware of their plan since the real trade was never in jeopardy. during the negotiations, ral-na observed rysn closely while talik served as an intermediary. ral-na was impressed by the fierceness of rysn's arguments and gave her a chance to speak to him directly, which was itself an honor, but ultimately told her that the trade could not continue since rysn had not earned the same level of respect as vstim. however, rysn refused to give up and unexpectedly climbed down a feeding rope to appeal directly to relu-na. ral-na seemed impressed, but quickly became concerned for rysn's safety and commanded her to return. however, the rope broke and rysn plummeted towards the water; she shattered her legs, but her life was spared by relu-na and she was gifted chiri-chiri. nahel bond[edit] at some point after rysn recovered and departed with vstim, ral-na bonded with an ashspren by saying the first ideal. after taking this oath, his body healed to match his gender identity. at first, his subjects believed it was a divine gift, but later concluded that it had something to do with the spren bond. approximately two years after rysn's visit, ral-na was part of a reshi delegation to urithiru to meet with dalinar kholin. one of the purposes of the journey was to find more about his spren bond and the knights radiant. talik was also part of the delegation, but he left the group at azimir so he could meet with rysn in thaylen city. lopen met with talik and advised him that ral-na should only speak to dalinar about his powers. relationships[edit] vstim[edit] ral-na considers vstim wise and trustworthy. vstim has a long history of trading on relu-na, and trained talik well. ral-na has a very high level of respect for vstim and is personally fond of him. family[edit] ral-na has a partner known as the king's consort, who is also one of talik's parents. the king's consort may perform certain duties of the king, especially if the king is absent. talik regularly serves as ral-na's interpreter. talik seems to be comfortable with ral-na's gender identity; he used the title of king without hesitation before ral-na transitioned and became annoyed when rysn questioned it, stating that ""gender is irrelevant"". he later mentions that ral-na's physical transition was considered a positive development. trivia[edit] - brandon has noted that ral-na's transition helps represent the fact that there would be many transgender knights radiant due to the self-discovery that occurs while progressing in the radiant oaths; - during the - , they would have had a progressive view of gender identity compared to the rest of society. notes[edit]"

Axies,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Axies,"""“and lo, the foul beast avoided imprisonment for public indecency! ”-axies"" axies the collector is a siah aimian engaged in a quest to catalog all the different varieties of spren on roshar. he is basically immortal, and he researches spren as his way of finding purpose in immortality. he is affected by the curse of kind. history[edit] given the hostility his race and appearance attracts and the likelihood of losing his possessions, he took to making his research notes by using his aimian talent for altering his body to create tattoo-like markings on his skin for later reference. throughout his life, axies has visited the valley to try and see the nightwatcher several dozen times, but has yet to be successful. he was searching for evidence of the existence of alespren by getting drunk somewhere in kasitor when he was beaten by unknown persons, robbed of his possessions, and left for dead in an alley. axies awakened the next day naked, lying on a pile of foul-smelling rotted vegetables, and suffering only from a headache. he used his ability to suppress his sense of smell and to banish the headache. he then met a crazy beggar who was furious that his city of rotted vegetables had been trampled. the beggar asked axies if he was a voidbringer or a herald because of the destruction he caused to the beggar's city. after stating that he was a voidbringer, axies cleverly convinced the beggar to give him his blanket, so he wouldn’t be arrested for public nudity. soon after, while observing cusicesh in the city, the blanket was stolen from him by a street urchin and axies was seized by the guards and arrested for public indecency. later on, rysn found axies hanging upside down from his feet as punishment for offending the religion of the people on one of the reshi isles. he had travelled to the reshi isles in order to find the tai-na's spren, which he speculated would be ""spectacular"" in comparison to the spren of normal greatshells. shortly after the rediscovery of urithiru, jochi mentions a sighting of axies in a spanreed communication with jasnah kholin. notes[edit]"
Talik,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Talik,"talik is a reshi trademaster who lives on relu-na. he is the son of the king of the island, ral-na. appearance and personality[edit] when talik meets with rysn, he is wearing the wrap and tassels common on relu-na, leaving his tan shoulders bare, and has his hair in two braids. he speaks thaylen so flawlessly that rysn feels the need to check him for thaylen eyebrows. he appears to have a curt, imperious personality during the negotiation with rysn, although that may simply be part of the act he puts on as part of his plan with vstim. history[edit] reshi isles[edit] talik was born to the king and king's consort of relu-na. his parents sent him to thaylenah to train with vstim as his babsk when he was a child; he finished his apprenticeship, becoming a trademaster, and returned to the island to interpret for the king and negotiate trade with outsiders. before vstim and rysn visit relu-na, talik and vstim agree to fabricate a tough, high-stakes trading situation as practice for rysn. unfortunately, it goes wrong when rysn, desperately wanting to complete the trade, paralyzes herself by jumping off the island and falling into the ocean. rysn's journey to akinah[edit] prior to rysn departing, talik met with her in her office in thaylenah. he offered rysn advise in regards to the ailing chiri-chiri, telling her that she must take chiri-chiri to the lost city of akinah, in aimia. notes[edit]"

Tai-na,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tai-na,"""“the tai-na is a good place to grow. good place to live. except when it's at war. ”-gu to rysn"" the tai-na are sapient island-sized greatshells worshiped as gods. they are inhabited by the reshi of roshar. appearance and anatomy[edit] the tai-na are the largest greatshells on roshar. they are the size of islands, and entire communities reside on their backs; rysn believes that the tai-na known as relu-na is as large as a town. a single tai-na eye is described as a ""the size of a house"" and it is situated more than fifty feet from the top of its head. they have huge mouths with massive mandibles; they enjoy fruit as a snack, although their primary sustenance is not known. their legs are over sixty feet long, able to reach the bottom of the reshi sea as they walk along. the main body of the tai-na is hundreds of feet tall, and hiking to the top of the shell from sea level is a long, arduous trek. tai-na have skin that is covered in plates of carapace. the shell is often carved by the reshi into stairs in order to more easily climb the tai-na; this is not thought to harm the animal. they are extremely long-lived. spren bond[edit] the tai-na are able to grow to extraordinary size due to a spren bond related to their gemhearts that allow their bodies to defy the laws of physics. tai-na are able to grow larger than terrestrial greatshells due to their aquatic habitat, although they technically could survive on land. axies the collector, who is an expert on spren, believes that the tai-na spren must be ""spectacular"" (even in comparison to those of other greatshells) to allow them to grow to such a large size. the tai-na spren seem to be sapient, and are thought to be capable of limited interaction with the physical world, such as slowing the fall of objects. the reshi jealously guard the island's spren, refusing to let outsiders investigate it. ecology[edit] a full ecosystem exists on the back of a tai-na, including grass, trees, and shalebark. some plants manage to find root in cracks on the tai-na's plate. most of the carapace is covered in forest and jungle, while the top of the head contains an open field of rockbuds. some larkin also lived on at least one tai-na, despite the belief that they had gone extinct in the scouring of aimia. there are dozens to hundreds of tai-na on the reshi sea. culture[edit] the reshi that make their homes on the back of the tai-na worship them as their gods; they state that they live to serve and please their gods. they believe that the tai-na approve of boldness, and interpret the movements of the tai-na as divine will. they also believe that these movements can be predicted, although sometimes they deviate from the expected course. at times when two tai-na get close, the two islands may go to war. each island has soldiers and a king (who may be of either gender) who lead them in these skirmishes. little bloodshed takes place, with the victory going to the bolder warriors. other times when tai-na get close to one another, good things happen. which occurs is somehow determined by the tai-na. the residents of the tai-na are generally secretive about the tai-na and their spren. they will not discuss the spren-which they refer to as the ""souls"" of the islands-with outsiders, and they are not always forthcoming about simple facts like the tai-na's diet. their reticence means that even educated people from other parts of roshar (such as rysn) are sometimes completely unaware of the existence of tai-na. the inhabitants include both native reshi and expatriates from other rosharan nations who have sought out the reshi lifestyle. vstim notes that the immigrants from other parts of roshar are only allowed to stay if they give all of their possessions to the king. many of the inhabitants are somewhat carefree and spend much of their time swimming or high diving, usually in the nude. some residents are combative, but in both battle and trade they are prone to posturing. the islanders are not primitive, but they do not have a great deal of contact with the outside world and are unaware of political and economic conditions on the mainland. however, they cannot produce all of the goods that they need on the island (such as medicine and textiles), and are forced to trade with outsiders. therefore, they only trade with those that they respect and trust to be fair. some reshi travel to other parts of roshar for education and training. notable tai-na[edit] - - saved - life and somehow gave her a larkin. - - a family of tai-na that took the larkin in after their near-extinction. trivia[edit] - the tai-na were first alluded to in - , during - interlude. - the tai-na are larger than some versions of godzilla. - in some slavic languages ""taina"" means ""mystery"" or ""secret"". notes[edit]"
Kara,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kara,"kara is a former scribe on roshar who joins bridge four and becomes a windrunner squire. appearance and personality[edit] kara stood out among the scribes even prior to joining bridge four, as lyn was familiar with her. she seems to fit in well with the other windrunners, displaying a sense of humor in her relationship with lunamor. attributes and abilities[edit] kara is surprisingly skilled with a spear. she has practiced with one since childhood, although she kept this ability secret when she was employed as a scribe. she becomes a squire to an unknown windrunner in bridge four at some point after the battle of thaylen field. she proves to be a quick learner and becomes one of the more proficient windrunner squires. even as a squire, her skill with both the spear and the surge of gravitation allow her to hold her own in battles with the heavenly ones. kaladin remarks that she is ready to advance to the third ideal, but no honorspren partners are available. it is unclear if an honorspren later becomes available for her to bond. as a trained scribe, she is able to write in the women's script and use a spanreed. she takes her own notes during scouting missions. history[edit] little is known of kara's history. since she served as a scribe for dalinar's forces under teshav khal she is likely alethi, but this is not confirmed. during the battle of thaylen field, teshav's scribe station was used as a field command post. the forces of the coalition of monarchs were stretched thin and every available soldier was needed. lyn confided in rock and renarin that kara was willing and able to fight since she had been training with a spear from a young age, facetiously referring to her childhood practice as ""cheating"". kara soon became a windrunner squire and was one of the many squires present during the evacuation mission to hearthstone on the fourth bridge in 1175. she was one of the few squires who were allowed to directly duel the fused and was seen scoring a hit on one of them with her spear. she engaged in some banter with rock after bridge four returned to urithiru. she also participated in scouting missions to singer-occupied alethkar, taking notes on the general condition of cities and their inhabitants as well as singer troop placements. notably, she reported on the city of tomat where hesina's father lived. trivia[edit] - many bridge four members are cameos of brandon's friends, - and she may be a cameo of - . notes[edit]"
I-nah,https://coppermind.net/wiki/I-nah,"i-nah are a type of tree native to the reshi sea on roshar. appearance and habitat[edit] the i-nah grow along the bottom of the reshi sea and are dozens of feet tall, with bark that is made of stone. the branches of the i-nah occasionally break the surface of the sea, but many are submerged just beneath the seawater. as the branches are stone, they form shoals, which can easily slice the hulls of the longboats common in the reshi sea. guides such as gu are used to navigate around them, and even know how to steer clear of the underwater branches which are almost invisible from above the surface of the sea. trivia[edit] - i-nah means bad in the language of the reshi. notes[edit]"

Aimia,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Aimian,"aimia is a group of islands on roshar that is separated from the main continent by the aimian sea. aimia is also the name of the largest island in the chain. the islands contained one of the silver kingdoms of roshar that survived the desolations. the kingdom of aimia existed for part, if not most, of the era of solitude, but at some point it was decimated in the scouring of aimia. geography[edit] aimia is an island chain that consists of one large island and numerous smaller islands situated off the west coast of shinovar. it is bordered on the east by the aimian sea and on the west by the endless ocean. aimia is subject to highstorms. one of the smaller islands at the north end of the chain is called akinah. this island has undersea caverns, and it is possible some other islands do as well. it is well protected from outsiders, due to a dawnshard having been present on the island until rysn became it and left. culture[edit] people[edit] a decent number of humans resided in aimia at one point. it appears that since the scouring they have been killed or fled, some of them to alm. these people did their beards in the same corded way as those from steen. little else is known about them. aimian races[edit] in addition to the human aimians, there are two distinct races of aimians: dysian aimians (or sleepless) and siah aimians. they are both non-human sentient beings. although they are not related, they each possess numerous unusual traits including a form of immortality and the ability to magically modify their bodies. humans are able to mate with siah aimians but not dysian aimians. although the aimians have no shared ancestry with humans or singers, they were created by the same person, presumably adonalsium. this implies that, like humans and singers, they existed before the shattering. however, it is unknown whether or not either are native to roshar. the relationship between the two races is not known, but they coexisted on the islands for thousands of years. the sleepless arclo refers to the siah axies the collector in a familiar manner. fauna[edit] aimia was a desolate and barren place, too cold for anything to grow. in order to become habitiable, some sort of device or devices, likely fabrials, were employed during the heraldic epochs to change its climate. many of the animals native to aimia differ from other animals on roshar. unlike shin animals, aimian animals fit into the ecosystem of roshar but have exceptional features that make them distinct, including the lancer, known for their large gemhearts, and larkin, known for ingesting investiture such as stormlight. lanceryn and larkin are directly related in some way. aimian animals are now exceptionally rare and modern rosharans incorrectly believe that larkin are extinct. the few larkin remaining appear to have been taken in by the na-alind, and rysn was given one of these in the reshi isles. at least one ancient text alludes to delicacies that come from aimia, possibly from endemic plants or animals. history[edit] arrival of the dawnshard[edit] at some unknown point in the distant past, a dawnshard was taken or came to aimia and was trapped in the akinah dawnshard mural. this dawnshard was protected by the lanceryn. silver kingdom[edit] aimia was one of the silver kingdoms during the heraldic epochs. it contained an oathgate connecting it to urithiru. as one of the ten kingdoms and a holder of an oathgate, it likely held one of the ten thrones in urithiru. akinah was the capital of the kingdom, and it was once a grand city built on a natural rock formation with tenfold symmetry. it was also known as the location to obtain soulcasters. siah aimians were integrated into larger rosharan society to the point that they are partial ancestors of some ethnic groups on the main continent. at least some of the aimians were close allies of the knights radiant. scouring of aimia[edit] at some point, a scouring occurred at aimia, however, what exactly occurred, and why, is unknown. while the exact time is uncertain, it occurred after the recreance but longer than four hundred years before the everstorm's arrival. axies the collector recalls it being fairly recent, while nikli recounts it as being many generations ago. nikli believes that aimia's fall was due to its extreme riches being too tempting to the rest of the world. ""“they assumed their secrets would protect them, but then their allies fell. and secrets can't hold swords.”-nikli to rysn on the scouring"" the fabrials or other devices regulating aimia's climate were destroyed, leaving the islands desolate and barren. the scouring decimated life on the islands. native animals nearly went extinct, and members of both of the immortal races are now rare. the surviving humans fled to other nations. the last few larkin were taken in by their cousins, the na-alind. the oathgate in akinah fell into disuse, isolating the islands. with the fall of the lanceryn and dispersal of the larkin, the dawnshard was left unprotected. the sleepless residing there decided to take up the role of its guardians because they did not want the power to fall into the wrong hands, as it was capable of destroying billions of people. the aimian sea near the islands became very dangerous, with strange winds and storms that seem to originate in the islands. in particular, one constant storm surrounds the island of akinah. akinah is now surrounded by a wall of soulcast stone spikes that are forty feet tall, with additional spikes underwater to deter ships. kaza believes that the spikes must have been created by multiple soulcasters working together. hessi theorized that an unmade, possibly dai-gonarthis, caused the destruction of aimia. modern day[edit] enough time has passed since the scouring that myths and stories about the aimian islands and their people have spread. akinah has many nicknames including ""the rock of secrets"" and ""the void's playground"", and rosharans speculate about what it contains. some individual aimians survive, and at least some are still on the islands. other cultures on roshar are aware that non-human aimians still exist, but generally have negative reactions to them if discovered, referring to their reverse shadow as a ""voidbringer shadow"". legends also speak of creatures that can eat stormlight and creatures that are living heaps of cremlings, although the latter legend has lost its association with aimia and its immortals. the sleepless have been very dedicated to protecting the dawnshard in the time since the scouring. they have killed anyone who gets near to discovering their secrets, with a total death toll numbering in the hundreds. they even built a fake version of the city of akinah, following the same cymatic pattern as the original, in order to build a ruined oathgate replica, in hopes of dissuading anyone who manages to get that far from returning. the real oathgate remains functional, albeit locked, underneath the replica. very recently, perhaps coinciding with the arrival of the everstorm, the protective storm around akinah has weakened somewhat. as a result of this, the ship first dreams was able to approach akinah, but the crew was poisoned by one of the sleepless, who was actively preventing humans from reaching the island. the sleepless said that it was protecting a secret that could lead to the ""end of worlds"". kaza made it to shore and saw a larkin, or perhaps a hordeling with the appearance of a larkin, and the faked ruins of akinah before dying. recently, scouting parties have been sent to the main island and found it quite barren. the royal navy of thaylenah has set up outposts there just in case. expedition to akinah[edit] in late 1174, rysn ftori headed an expedition to akinah which brought back eight soulcasters and a set of shardplate. rysn became the dawnshard and the sleepless guarding it let her return, conceding that akinah was growing too hard to protect.

Gtet,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Gtet,"the gtet is a traditional sword used in thaylenah on roshar. appearance[edit] the gtet has a large, triangular-shaped blade that is very wedge-like. the blade extends down past the grip, which is held like a fist. the grip is directly at the bottom and part of the hilt rests around the wrist for support. it is more of a handle than a true hilt. the gtet is carried in a sheath at one's side when it is not in use. known users[edit] kylrm, one of vstim's guards, carries a gtet as his weapon, along with a bow. adolin kholin brings a gtet with him on his expedition to visit lasting integrity. he shows it to godeke before they depart. trivia[edit] - the description of the gtet has some similarities to both a - blade known as the - and a real-life dagger from india known as the - . notes[edit]"
Relu-na,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Relu-na,"relu-na is a tai-na in the reshi sea on roshar. a greatshell the size of an island, she is worshiped as a god by her inhabitants. appearance and personality[edit] like other tai-na, relu-na has grown to extraordinary size due to a spren bond related to her gemheart that allows her body to defy the laws of physics. rysn believes that relu-na is as large as a town. one of relu-na's eyes is described as a ""the size of a house"" and it is situated more than fifty feet from the top of her head. she has a massive mouth with huge mandibles. she is referred to as female by gu. relu-na's shell has the appearance of a mountainous island jutting out from the ocean with no beach. she is not immediately identifiable as a living being, but when she moves it becomes easier to see that she has legs. she has a stony carapace covered with an array of plant life including moss, trees, shalebark, and rockbuds. the plants grow as thick as a jungle or forest over most of the shell, but relatively few plants grow on the head. the shell has protrusions near the waterline that are used as docks by the residents of the island; stairs have also been cut into the shell. the sea is unusually warm near relu-na and rysn compares the water to that of the purelake. relu-na appears to be ancient, as tai-na are very long-lived. the natives feed relu-na fruit, but only as a treat; they do not divulge her primary food source. the tai-na are sentient, and the reshi people believe that they are also sapient and capable of decision-making. gu mentions that when two tai-na approach each other, they decide what will happen next-a war, or something ""good"". history[edit] rysn and vstim visited relu-na hoping to trade for a larkin corpse. rysn was shocked by the existence of tai-na and was unfamiliar with the island's culture. she and her guards were led on a long hike up to relu-na's head to meet the king, ral-na. on the way, they encountered axies the collector, who had been visiting relu-na as part of his ongoing spren research. axies had tried to investigate the tai-na spren, possibly mandras, but the natives refused to discuss it and instead bound his feet and hung him upside-down. upon reaching relu-na's head, rysn attempted to trade with the natives. unbeknownst to rysn, vstim had actually trained the king's son, talik, and had covertly arranged for him to be tough on rysn as a training exercise. however, rysn became so frustrated by the negotiation that she made a bold attempt to gain the trust of the natives. she climbed down a rope suspended hundreds of feet over the ocean and attempted to address relu-na directly, but fell when the rope snapped. she survived the fall, and vstim later told her that the island's spren somehow saved her life. rysn says she was trying to gain respect after vstim and talik repeatedly insisted that relu-na placed a great deal of value on boldness; after her bold yet reckless act, the island somehow gifted her a living larkin. when rysn later wrote to talik regarding her worries about chiri-chiri's deteriorating health, talik and the king were in azimir. talik wrote to the inhabitants of the island, and the king's consort approached relu-na, who somehow indicated that chiri-chiri needed be taken home to akinah. inhabitants[edit] relu-na's residents are typical for a tai-na, and include both native reshi and expatriates from other parts of roshar. the residents generally lead a relaxed lifestyle and often spend their time swimming and diving. the island is ruled by a king, who has authority over the soldiers and would lead them in battle if necessary. notes[edit]"
Archinal,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Archinal,"""“you mustn't assume that what you see here relates to what you know from your life, human highprince. ”-archinal on shadesmar, to adolin"" archinal is a cultivationspren on roshar. she is currently bonded to godeke. appearance and personality[edit] like other cultivationspren, archinal appears in shadesmar as a humanoid composed of vines. the vines are verdant and wound tightly, although they are not as tight as those of mayalaran. archinal is short and wears manifested robes as clothing. she has crystal eyes and incredibly fine and delicate crystal hands. in the physical realm, godeke can summon her as a shardblade, but its specific appearance is unknown. adolin believes that archinal has an air of aloofness. she seems to be rather apprehensive in unfamiliar situations. attributes and abilities[edit] archinal shares a nahel bond with godeke, giving her sapience in the physical realm. the bond also grants godeke access to the surges of abrasion and progression as a member of the radiant order of edgedancers. based on lift and wyndle's experience, godeke has likely spoken at least the third ideal of the edgedancers since he can summon archinal as a blade. she is able to ride a horse in the cognitive realm. history[edit] it is not clear when archinal bonded with godeke, but by the time of the mission in hearthstone in chach 1175, godeke could summon her as a blade. although lift was the only edgedancer known before the battle of thaylen field, cultivationspren became eager to bond with the new radiants after other spren began to do so, and bonding a human gained them some esteem among their peers. she has described shadesmar at length to godeke. cultivationspren do not have their own settlements, so it is not clear where archinal resides. at some point, archinal visited lasting integrity. urithiru emissary delegation (1175)[edit] godeke was chosen to join the envoy to the honorspren in lasting integrity due to his experience as a diplomat and the fact that dalinar wanted to include as many radiant orders as possible. archinal's experience traveling in shadesmar made her a valuable member of the team; in addition to her general knowledge regarding the cognitive realm, she knew the route to lasting integrity since she had been there before. archinal and godeke sometimes served as scouts for the group, since godeke had learned some scouting techniques during his radiant training. when the expedition reached nameless, archinal and godeke were the first to spot the tukari caravaneers. after adolin decided to investigate the tukari, the group passed several friendly spren caravans; at least one spren recognized archinal and called out to her by name. as they approached the tukari, archinal mentioned that more and more people were trading through shadesmar as they heard about rosharan wines and weapons. she was visibly nervous about the tukari and warned adolin that not everything in shadesmar was what it seemed. archinal presumably stayed with godeke while the group awaited the results of adolin's trial. notes[edit]"

Tukari caravaneers,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tukari_caravaneers,"""“the way these people seemed to be constantly wreathed in shadow . . . it was unnerving. ”-adolin’s describing the tukari"" the tukari caravaneers are a group of mercenaries who are active in the southern area of the sea of souls and are known to attack spren. there are more than twenty members in the group, and the leader wears a blue-on-yellow-patterned overcoat. it is possible the group are employed by ishar and have been tasked to bring him spren bodies that he can use in his experiments. organization[edit] ""“...he felt like he could see only hints of features, and no matter which way they turned, the pits of their faces-the eye sockets, the lines along their noses-were always dark. ”-adolin describing the tukari"" the group is composed of male and female tukari workers who have brown skin and black hair. they dress in the fashion of southeastern makabak with clothing that uses the same colors and patterns as the azish, but with a thicker, coarser, and a more enveloping material. this type of clothing also has braided tassels that hang from the waist. several members carry cloth bracelets that may have tukari clan writing on them. the group does not employ pack animals and during times of rest, will pile their belongings together in the center of their camp where people will periodically sleep. guards are posted to watch over the possessions and sleeping members of the camp. the group carry weapons in the form of cudgels and cutlasses, although they do not openly carry the latter. there are a few shields owned by members of the group, however, none of the tukari appear to have armor or bows. it is likely that the only person in the group with military or battle training is the group’s leader. their camp is unwelcoming and eerie. there is a sense of unease around the group and the feeling like everything is in shadow, including the tukari themselves, with it being difficult to make out the full details of their facial features. this is likely exacerbated by the group’s preference towards not illuminating their campsite, despite having access to manifested fire. at least one person in the group speaks rough alethi, with others speaking tukari. history[edit] the group stopped in nameless in 1175, at the same time that notum was visiting the settlement. while camping, they were approached by adolin and godeke who wished to learn more about their group. the tukari caravaneers quickly turned the other humans away, preferring to keep to themselves away from the other occupants of the town. it is likely that the tukari were planning on attacking notum and his guards soon after the honorspren contingent left nameless, however, due to the presence of the urithiru delegates in the area, were forced to hold off until the groups went their separate ways. ""“hey, let’s talk! you’ve got an honorspren there. how much do you want for him?”-adolin attempting to rescue notum"" the tukari followed behind adolin’s group for several weeks, making sure to stay at least several hours behind the humans from urithiru. adolin, thinking that the tukari were following his own group of travelers, set a number of his soldiers to keep an eye on the tukari throughout their trip, in case the group attempted to attack them. several times, adolin tried to contact the group during their trip, however, all of the messengers he sent were turned away. the tukari turned south approximately a day’s journey from lasting integrity, following notum’s patrol that had earlier gone in the same direction. when they caught up to notum’s group, the tukari sent a portion of their members after the honorspren and his reacher companions, attacking them with torches, swords, and spears, before capturing and tying up each spren. after immobilizing the spren, the tukari began to repeatedly stab and attack the bound honorspren in order to “kill” him by breaking his mind through pain. after realizing that the group had not been following his own contingent, adolin, along with maya, went after the tukari in order to provide assistance to notum, while the rest of the urithiru delegates, excluding pattern, followed behind. unable to wait for backup, adolin engaged the group of mercenaries to try and buy time until his soldiers arrived. ""“don’t suppose you’d agree to fighting one at a time, a set of friendly duels? i’ll go easy on you, i promise.”-adolin attempting to rescue notum"" the tukari responded poorly to losing six of their members in adolin’s opening attack, with many of the men shying away when approached, which adolin pressed on and used to his advantage. the captain of the group began giving orders to the other men, to organize their attack against the alethi highprince, to help stabilize the group against adolin’s attacks and prevent the tukari leader from having his men devolve into complete chaos. during the fighting, the tukari were able to successfully stab adolin through the stomach with a spear. the tukari became more hesitant when maya joined the fight to assist adolin, scared and unwilling to attack. although the leader attempted to have his men continue their assault, the deaths of a few more tukari members led some of the group to run from the fight, back towards where they had left their remaining members with their caravan. the tukari leader’s bodyguard attempted to attack adolin directly, however, adolin dodged the man and landed a hit on the shoulder of the group leader. eventually, the rest of the tukari fighters broke and abandoned the battle to retreat to their caravan. after the battle ceased, the tukari caravan withdrew from the area. fearing a second attack, adolin’s group pushed to reach lasting integrity by the end of the day to seek safety from the tukari with the honorspren. notes[edit]"

Envisagers,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Envisagers,"the envisagers were a group of people who secretly bore the remembrance of the knights radiant and awaited their return. currently there are no living envisagers known, although they could potentially still exist in yulay, as sigzil speaks of a group there with similar goals. they are probably a splinter group of the sons of honor. beliefs[edit] they believed in the knights radiant, their way of life, the immortal words, the ideals, and also in the almighty, and even in old vorinism. they knew the immortal words and the ideals of the knights radiant. they desired the return of the knights radiant. similarly to the sons of honor, they believed that if they could find a way to return the voidbringers, the knights radiant would also return. they also believed that the powers of the knights radiant were likely to manifest themselves in someone whose life was in danger. they would place themselves in mortal danger, often dying in the attempt. teft spoke of people being pushed off of cliffs or crushed by rocks. teft[edit] teft's parents were envisagers. contrary to his parents, teft thought it nonsense and left the sect. he didn't believe until he saw kaladin infusing stormlight. unfortunately, teft couldn't seek advice from them, because he unintentionally caused their deaths when he reported the envisagers' activities to their citylord. the citylord, for reasons teft does not understand, had the entire group executed. quotes[edit] ""“the envisagers were gone. dead, because of what he had done. if there were others, he had no idea how to locate them. ”-teft"" ""“they thought that people were more likely to manifest powers if their lives were in danger. so...they'd put lives in danger. members of their own group-never an innocent outsider, bless the winds. but that was bad enough. i watched people let themselves be pushed off cliffs, watched them tied in place with a candle slowly burning a rope until it snapped and dropped a rock to crush them. ”-teft"" notes[edit]"
War of Loss,https://coppermind.net/wiki/War_of_Loss,"""“the war of loss had destroyed the hierocracy, shattering vorinism into the devotaries. that was the inevitable result of a religion trying to rule. ”-shallan's thoughts on the war of loss"" the war of loss was when the sunmaker ended the hierocracy and its control of roshar. background[edit] the vorin church had taken control of much of the world, obfuscating its own doctrine from the common people. they wanted to unite the world under vorinism, ruled by the ardents. people were taught to follow the ardents instead of the heralds or the almighty. they most powerful ardents claimed visions from the almighty himself, which further solidified their control by creating a mysticism the common people could not achieve or understand. at the height of their power, the hierocracy controlled most of eastern roshar. although it is not clear exactly which countries were controlled by them, it is likely that all the modern vorin countries were under their influence. defeat of the hierocracy[edit] before the hierocracy could spread to western roshar, the hierocracy became embroiled in the war of loss, a conflict spearheaded by the man later known as the sunmaker. the sunmaker united together the ten princedoms of alethkar for the first time since the fall of alethela into one nation. it is unknown if any other factions joined them, but working together the alethi forces fought the hierocracy in truly epic battles, whose like has not been seen on roshar since then. his soldiers were driven by the thrill. he also made use of an entire company of cavalry with legendary speed and maneuverability. the sunmaker managed to cast down the hierocracy. its fall led to much chaos and destruction, and many eastern cities were sacked and destroyed, with the notable exception of kholinar. the sunmaker himself interrogated the remaining priests and went through their correspondences. he claimed that he had found no proof of any of the visions that they had claimed to be receiving from the almighty, stating that it had been a massive fraud on the part of the church. the central leadership of the vorin church was destroyed. aftermath and legacy[edit] vorinism was then shattered in the devotaries, and ardents lost much of their power, only able to teach laws, not enforce them. they were no longer allowed to be involved in politics, unable to own property, and were actually considered the property of lighteyes. these events are still a source of embarrassment to modern day ardents, who prefer not to speak of them. sadees, after his win, claimed to have a mandate from the almighty and crowned himself king of the united alethkar, he decided to continue conquering the world, starting with herdaz and going at least to azimir, where he committed genocide, killing ten percent of the azish population. the kingdom he'd united during the war collapsed after his death. he had never bothered to choose an heir, so his ten sons began fighting among themselves. they eventually split the into ten princedoms, each becoming a highprince. notes[edit]"
Shadowdays,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Shadowdays,"""“ the desolations had happened during the near-mythical shadowdays, before real history began. ”- dalinar's thoughts on the desolations"" the shadowdays refers to history before recorded memory on roshar. definition and usage[edit] ""“ there are histories from the time when the radiants lived. that’s not as far back as the shadowdays or the heraldic epochs. ”- renarin talking about history"" the exact definition of when the shadowdays ended seems uncertain and differs between people. the majority of people seem to accept them as including the era of the silver kingdoms and the height of the knights radiant and ending after the last desolation, although it is possible some consider them to extend past that point. renarin states that there was a time after the shadowdays when the knights radiant still existed. however, dalinar comments that the recreance is old enough to nearly be part of the shadowdays. ""“ legends. the recreance is an event so old, it might as well be in the shadowdays. ”- dalinar speaking of the recreance"" based on these comments, it is likely the shadowdays are generally considered to have ended sometime between the last desolation and the recreance. art and literature[edit] there are very few surviving pieces of artwork or writing from this time, leading to the lack of knowledge about them. much of the knowledge of that time comes from fragments, such as a copy of a copy of a mosaic. the way of kings--which survives only in translation--is the only complete text from the shadowdays prior to the translation of the dawnchant, but lost texts like the eila stele were rediscovered along with the dawnchant's translation. the carved pillars in the kholinar palace's eastern hall is art surviving from this time. powers and weapons[edit] some of the hallmarks of the shadowdays are mythical weapons and powers. the honorblades were forged by honor and used by the heralds in fighting voidbringers. the true nature of the abilities of the knights radiant during this time, including surgebinding and glowing shardplate, are also mythical to most rosharans. notable people[edit] notable people who are believed to have lived during the shadowdays include derethil, a king, and nohadon, the writer of the way of kings. raboniel also lived during those days, and she is able to recount to navani what her grandmother told her after seeing the humans first arriving on roshar from ashyn. notes[edit]"
Ellista,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ellista,"ellista is an ardent and scholar at the jokasha monastery in jah keved on roshar. she is part of the devotary of the mind. she is a diachronic linguist and one of the scholars involved in the dawnchant translation. appearance and personality[edit] like most ardents, ellista has a shaved head. she had never liked dealing with her hair, which leads her parents to joke that she became an ardent just so she could shave it off. ""“a large swath of trees out there had been flattened by the new storm. but that was no reason for everyone to get upset!”-ellista's musings on the everstorm"" she dislikes disruption and distraction and generally prefers to be left alone. she has a no-nonsense attitude and can be skeptical and judgmental. when she hears fellow ardents arguing about the everstorm or discussing political happenings throughout roshar, she takes no interest. she believes that everyone is overreacting to the everstorm. she is well-read in her field and seems to be a gifted researcher and linguist, as urv calls her ""brilliant"" and notes that she makes incredible progress in translating dawnchant fragments collected by bendthel. she is a fan of risqué alethi epics. history[edit] ellista moved to the jokasha monastery at some point before dalinar kholin began receiving visions during 1173. she considers herself lucky to have a place in jokasha, as it is a desirable location for many ardents. before becoming an ardent, she thought that scholars did not bicker, but has since realized that was a misconception. working on the dawnchant[edit] ""“look, there’s easy proof here that the same writing system was once used all across roshar... not a diaspora of texts, but real evidence they wrote naturally in the dawnchant. ”-ellista to urv on the historical use of the dawnchant"" after navani kholin provides the key to the dawnchant that she recovers through dalinar's visions, scholars in the monastery, including ellista, begin to decode the old texts that they had in their possession. ellista is glad to have navani's information, but refuses to believe that the visions were real. the coming of the everstorm distracts many ardents from their translation work, but ellista persists. she believes that she has found evidence that dawnchant was once used as a unified written language across ancient roshar, supporting a theory posited by jasnah kholin in relic and monument. she vehemently disagrees with earlier arguments (including those made by fiksin) that written dawnchant texts all originated in a single region. through her studies, she has also been able to determine that the cataclysmic desolations caused dawnchant to fall into disuse. individual nations began to use the dawnchant to phonetically record their spoken language, and later developed their own glyphs, abandoning dawnchant altogether. encounter with urv[edit] while attempting to read an accountability of virtue, ellista is interrupted by several ardents arguing about the movements of the everstorm. hoping for some peace and quiet, she leaves her reading nook in the monastery's library and makes her way to a reading desk in a nearby hallway. unfortunately, she is again interrupted by discussion of the new storm and is forced to move. after having no luck in the lower buildings, ellista ventures into the forest where she was at last alone, and could read uninterrupted. in the forest, ellista is soon found by another ardent at the monastery named urv who hoped to check on her progress with the dawnchant translation. much to her dismay, urv does not leave after she hands over her notes, instead settling down nearby to review her translations. ellista gives urv a synopsis of her research on the dawnchant, and he is suitably impressed. while they talk, urv notices that ellista is sitting on her copy of an accountability of virtue in an unsuccessful attempt to hide it. urv comments that he has read the book himself, and offers to lend ellista the sequel in exchange for her help translating the covad fragment. he claims that he is working on the fragment at the request of an unnamed patron. notes[edit]"
Summary:The Way of Kings,https://coppermind.net/wiki/The_Way_of_Kings/Summary,"this page contains a chapter by chapter summary of the way of kings. we hope this summary will make it easier to find specific areas of the book, as well as providing a quick plot refresher for anyone who doesn't want to take the time to reread the entire book. prelude to the stormlight archive[edit] kalak, one of the ten heralds, wanders through a torn landscape littered with dead humans, thunderclasts, and other beasts. he is traveling to the heralds' preordained meeting place (a rocky spire) for those who survived the desolation. upon arrival, he finds only their leader, jezrien, waiting for him. at first, kalak assumes that the other eight must have died, for the battle was ""furious"". however, he notices seven honorblades driven point-first into the ground at the base of the spire. jezrien then informs kalak that the other heralds have departed, abandoning the oathpact. kalak then admits to jezrien that he can't return to ""the place of nightmares"", the waiting place of the heralds between desolations. jezrien then tells kalak to relinquish his blade as well, for ""...it is time for the oathpact to end."" this effectively leaves talenel (taln), the only herald who died in the battle, alone to uphold the oathpact and the sole sufferer of the pain and torture in the waiting realm. kalak shows horror and disgust that both jezrien and himself have been broken by the cycle of desolations and that they are too weak to face their suffering. they plan to lie and tell the people that they finally won against the ""enemy"", saying it might even turn out to be true. their abandonment of mankind is somewhat diluted by the fact that ishar, another herald, believes that ""...so long as there is one of us still bound to the oathpact (talenel), it may be enough. there is a chance we might end the cycle of desolations."" jezrien points out that mankind also has the radiants. finally, both jezrien and kalak summon their blades and slam them into the ground, along with the other seven. they depart in opposite directions along the barren landscape, vowing to go their own ways and to not seek one another or any of the other heralds. as kalak is leaving the ring of swords, he looks back and notices a single open spot, ""the place where the tenth sword should have gone."" kalak feels deep sorrow and shame for taln's exclusion, thinking to himself, ""forgive us..."" as he walks away. prologue: to kill[edit] ""the love of men is a frigid thing, a mountain stream only three steps from the ice. we are his. oh stormfather...we are his. it is but a thousand days, and the everstorm comes."" szeth 4500 years later, szeth, a truthless shin assassin, waits quietly in a large room, watching the alethi celebrate the signing of a peace treaty with the parshendi. he leaves the room, noting that his parshendi masters will soon withdraw. szeth wears white under the orders of the parshendi to follow their traditions so that king gavilar could see him coming. when he reaches the area just outside the king's quarters, szeth uses his abilities as a surgebinder to fight his way past the guards. as he reaches the king's quarters, he is confronted by a shardbearer as the king flees. szeth fights his way past the shardbearer but soon realizes that the shardbearer, not the man he is chasing, is king gavilar. he returns and fights him, eventually defeating him by causing the balcony he is standing on to collapse, mortally wounding him. szeth is nearly killed in the fight. when szeth tells gavilar the parshendi sent him, gavilar is confused and says, ""the parshendi? that makes no sense."" gavilar then gives szeth a strange black sphere and tells him, ""you must take this. they must not get it."" he then instructs szeth to tell gavilar's brother dalinar that he must ""find the most important words a man can say."" as a shin, szeth considers a dying wish to be sacred, so he leaves a note for dalinar written in gavilar's blood. he takes the sphere and flees. part one: above silence[edit] chapter 1: stormblessed[edit] ""you've killed me. bastards, you've killed me! while the sun is still hot, i die!"" cenn cenn, a new recruit in brightlord meridas amaram's army, is terrified. he is about to face his first battle and has no real idea of what to expect. cenn is pulled into a new squad, that of kaladin stormblessed, at the last minute for reasons he doesn't understand. dallet, a sergeant, picks cenn up and returns him to the squad. they are soon joined by kaladin, who asks dallet to take care of cenn during the battle as he won't know the group's signals. they then fall to discussing tactics. the opposing force arrives and the battle begins. kaladin's squad does not lose a single man. at one point, kaladin singlehandedly fights off six enemy spearmen to save cenn. when an enemy brightlord appears, kaladin and his squad attempt to defeat him. they are hindered, however, by the arrival of an enemy shardbearer. cenn blacks out from blood loss, and the scene cuts out. chapter 2: honor is dead[edit] ""ten orders. we were loved, once. why have you forsaken us, almighty! shard of my soul, where have you gone?"" kaladin kaladin is now a slave in a caravan, waiting to be sold and struggling to retain his ability to not think like a slave. when approached by another slave about escaping, kaladin gruffly tells him that he has no plans to escape because it will never work. a second slave approaches kaladin and asks how he came to be a slave. when kaladin doesn't respond, the other men tell their stories. it eventually comes out that kaladin killed a man, but the one he did not kill is the reason he's a slave. kaladin idly toys with a leaf of blackbane, contemplating using it to poison tvlakv, his slave trader. a windspren in the form of a slender young woman only a handspan tall speaks to kaladin and wants to know what the blackbane is. kaladin is surprised that she knows his name. as they converse, he observes that she is much more intelligent than a typical spren. when she asks why he doesn't fight anymore, he says that he has failed. kaladin sees tvlakv going to inspect a sick slave. kaladin tells him that the man has the grinding coughs and will survive if given extra water. tvlakv removes the man from the rest of the slaves, and kaladin thinks he is going to give him water. instead, bluth brutally murders the man. kaladin is upset over his failure to save him. in his anger at the other slave's murder, he crushed the blackbane against the bars of the wagon, losing most of it. chapter 3: city of bells[edit] ""a man stood on a cliffside and watched his homeland fall into dust. the waters surged beneath, so far beneath. and he heard a child crying. they were his own tears."" shallan davar shallan davar has just arrived in kharbranth, the city of bells. she experiences a culture-shock, amazed at the number and variety of people in the city. after a short conversation with captain tozbek of the wind's pleasure, the boat she arrived on, she gets word that jasnah kholin, the woman she has been chasing for several months, is still in the city. shallan and one of captain tozbek's sailors, yalb, make the trip up to the palace so shallan can speak to jasnah. when they arrive, she asks yalb to wait for her outside the palace. it is revealed that shallan had requested to be jasnah's ward, and that jasnah told her to meet her in dumadari. shallan has been chasing her from city to city ever since. shallan is very nervous as her house's finances are in ruins since the death of her father, and if she doesn't find some source of income or other means of controlling their rival political houses, her house won't last long. she also reveals that her request to be jasnah's ward is somehow related to resolving her house's crisis, though she does not make clear how. the chapter ends with shallan turning a corner and seeing jasnah. chapter 4: the shattered plains[edit] ""i'm dying, aren't i? healer, why do you take my blood? who is that beside you, with his head of lines? i can see a distant sun, dark and cold, shining in a black sky."" kaladin kaladin is sitting in the slave wagon, waiting for the caravan to stop for lunch and noting that it's well after the time the caravan usually stops. after a few minutes, he realizes that it is because tvlakv is lost. tvlakv remembers that kaladin was once an alethi soldier and might have knowledge of the lands. when he asks kaladin to help them find the way out, kaladin tears his map to pieces and tells tvlakv that he doesn't know the way out. in the conversation that follows, tvlakv says that he is only comfortable with the idea of kaladin escaping because he knows that he wants revenge on brightlord amaram more than he does on tvlakv. kaladin realizes that if tvlakv knows about amaram, then he also knows that kaladin isn't actually a deserter, in contrast to the official story given when he was sold. tvlakv acknowledges this but says that it's the story they will stick to because men who are guilty of high crimes are difficult to sell at a good price. a short time later, the windspren comes back. she had apparently left during the recent highstorm, but now tells kaladin that there is a large group of people not far away. a few minutes later, kaladin realizes that it's an alethi war camp, and that their destination is the shattered plains. the other slaves express hope that they will be treated fairly in the warcamps. kaladin has his doubts, thinking of the many lighteyes who have proven to be corrupt in the past. his one remaining hope is that he will be allowed to fight again. chapter 5: heretic[edit] ""i have seen the end, and have heard it named. the night of sorrows, the true desolation. the everstorm."" shallan as shallan meets jasnah kholin for the first time, she admires jasnah as the ideal beauty - tall, alethi tan skin, long dark hair. she is talking to a man who shallan later identifies as king taravangian of kharbranth. jasnah and taravangian seem to be negotiating over something, though shallan can't tell what. as they begin to walk, jasnah beckons for shallan to follow. after a preliminary conversation, jasnah mentions that because shallan was so persistent in seeking her out, she will hear her petition to be her ward. shallan is shocked, as she had believed that she had already been accepted as jasnah's ward. a lengthy conversation about shallan's level of education ensues, in which it is decided that shallan has passing skill in most subjects, is very good in the sciences, excels at drawing and writing (the feminine arts), and is sadly lacking in history and philosophy. they arrive at the entrance to a room which has been blocked off by a large, fallen stone. shallan realizes that the king's granddaughter is trapped in the room, and jasnah is planning to use her soulcaster to remove the stone in exchange for access to the palanaeum. jasnah soulcasts the stone, transforming it into smoke. the king retrieves his granddaughter and, when asked, agrees to take jasnah to the palanaeum. jasnah rejects shallan as her ward because of her lack of education in history and philosophy. shallan is frustrated, but decides to persevere. it is then that shallan reveals that she wishes to become jasnah's ward not out of scholarly pursuit, but in order to steal her soulcaster to help her family's finances recover. chapter 6: bridge four[edit] ""i'm cold. mother, i'm cold. mother? why can i still hear the rain? will it stop?"" kaladin kaladin and the rest of the slave caravan have arrived at the shattered plains, specifically at the warcamp of highprince sadeas. they are taken to a woman who is to decide whether she can use any of the slaves or not. when kaladin tries to convince her to let him fight, tvlakv tells her that kaladin is a deserter, dashing his hopes. the woman decides that kaladin and his companions are to be made members of the bridge crews. kaladin and his new immediate superior, gaz, take an instant dislike to each other, and as a result, kaladin is placed in one of the worst locations on the bridge when they are called on a bridge run, without the benefit of shoes or vest for protection. after several hours of agony carrying the bridge, they arrive at the chasm where the enemy parshendi are waiting on the other side. they take volleys of arrows while placing their bridge. kaladin is the only survivor in the front row. he wakes up hours later when the windspren who's been following him shocks him with some sort of energy. kaladin realizes that if he doesn't hurry, he will be left behind. the spren tells him that her name is sylphrena, or syl. though he is exhausted, kaladin takes a spot on the bridge and begins the long way back to camp. chapter 7: anything reasonable[edit] ""they are aflame. they burn. they bring the darkness when they come, and so all you can see is that their skin is aflame. burn, burn, burn..."" shallan shallan is en route to the palanaeum, hoping to convince jasnah that she is worthy to be her ward. she believes that it is critical that she find a way to do so, as without her father, her family can no longer soulcast its way into wealth or manipulate others into doing as they want. she is allowed to wait for jasnah in her reading alcove, though she is denied access to the palanaeum itself. while she waits, she sketches several memories from the past few hours, then writes a letter to jasnah containing arguments for her reconsideration. she is interrupted by an ardent introducing himself as kabsal. he asks to wait for jasnah with shallan and praises her sketches highly. kabsal tells shallan that he is trying to convert jasnah, an avowed atheist, to vorinism. he leaves, asking her to let jasnah know that he had come by to speak with her. she agrees, and begins to lacquer her drawings. she realizes that she's been there for quite a while and begins to gather her things, leaving the letter for jasnah. before she can leave, however, jasnah appears in the doorway, looking displeased. chapter 8: nearer the flame[edit] ""victory! we stand atop the mount! we scatter them before us! their homes become our dens, their lands are now our farms! and they shall burn, as we once did, in a place that is hollow and forlorn."" shallan jasnah scolds shallan, telling her that she had already made her decision. shallan is embarrassed that she disturbed jasnah again and leaves. after only a few moments, however, jasnah calls her back and apologizes to her and gives her shallan's money pouch that she had left behind. shallan asks jasnah to read the letter she had written for her earlier. jasnah is impressed that she is self-taught and agrees to accept shallan as her ward once she has adequately learned philosophy and history. shallan is pleased by this, but worries that she cannot learn fast enough to save her house. shallan leaves the conclave and meets up with yalb, who has been gambling with some guards. yalb insists that she is talented enough to be accepted if she would just be more persistent, so she decides to buy a bunch of books on history and philosophy and return to start studying right away, planning to impress jasnah with her rapid learning just before jasnah leaves kharbranth. before long, however, she is interrupted by jasnah, who had paid the servants to tell her if shallan returned to the palanaeum. jasnah asks to see shallan's satchel. when she comes across shallan's sketches with notes on biology, she asks why she made them, to which shallan replies that she wanted to. it is ultimately the fact that shallan pursues scholarship in her free time, along with her persistence, that convince jasnah to accept her as her ward. shallan reflects that now she's completed the first phase of her plan, but now needs to discover how to accomplish the rest of it without being caught. chapter 9: damnation[edit] ""ten people, with shardblades alight, standing before a wall of black and white and red."" kaladin has now been a member of the bridge crews for somewhere between two to four weeks. of the twenty five who survived his first bridge run, only one other man is still alive. a few new arrivals are brought in, and kaladin sees a young boy who reminds him of his younger brother tien. in general, kaladin is handling the transition to life as a bridge crew member poorly, snapping at syl and becoming despondent. syl leaves, unable to continue watching him in his current state. the bridge crews are called on another run, and the boy who reminded him of tien is killed, as well as the only remaining man from kaladin's first bridge run. kaladin thinks to himself that he is dead inside, then proceeds to cry. chapter 10: stories of surgeons[edit] kal (his nickname as a boy) helps his father, lirin, treat a young woman, sani. he reflects over the course of the surgery on how his family is treated so differently because of his father's career. when they finish amputating sani's middle finger, lirin asks kaladin why he was late to arrive, and kaladin replies that he was with a boy named jam learning to use a quarterstaff. this sparks a debate between kaladin and lirin about the relative merits of being a soldier or a surgeon. lirin meets kaladin's claim that it's possible to save lives by killing others with the assertion that doing so is like ""trying to stop a storm by blowing harder."" eventually, kaladin simply stops arguing and goes back to cleaning up the room. lirin quizzes him on various things a surgeon should know, then tells him that he plans to send him to kharbranth to train under the surgeons there if he can find a way to do so. lirin also tells him that he's incredibly gifted when it comes to surgery, and he shouldn't waste himself on soldiering. chapter 11: droplets[edit] ""three of sixteen ruled, but now the broken one reigns."" kaladin is outside just after a highstorm, going to the honor chasm to commit suicide. gaz stops him, accusing him of trying to steal spheres left out in the highstorm from others, but kaladin simply ignores him and goes. just as kaladin is about to step into the chasm, syl reappears, carrying a single blackbane leaf which she had brought hoping to make kaladin happy. when kaladin expresses his frustrations at his previous failures to protect people, syl convinces him to try again, arguing that the bridgemen are going to die anyway, so his efforts cannot hurt. kaladin returns to the camp and attacks gaz, throwing him to the ground. he demands that gaz make him bridgeleader of bridge four, and that he give kaladin full control of it. in return, gaz receives one fifth of kaladin's wages. kaladin then goes inside the barracks and begins asking the other bridgemen's names, noticing for the first time how pathetic they all are. interludes[edit] interlude i-1: ishikk[edit] ishikk ishikk, a fisherman in the purelake, is just returning home after a long day of fishing. after pausing to talk to thaspic he meets with maib, a local woman who has been attempting to get him to marry her for years by trying to keep him in her debt, mostly by giving him food. ishikk tries to counterbalance her efforts by bringing her fish that cure her aches in her joints. following a brief conversation with maib, ishikk goes to meet with a group of foreigners. they ask him about whether he has any new information for them, and ishikk tells them that he has been to many villages in the area and none of them know anything about the man the foreigners are looking for, revealed to be hoid. the foreigners (all worldhoppers, namely demoux from scadrial, galladon from sel and baon from taldain) argue amongst themselves for a while, then leave ishikk to his thoughts. interlude i-2: nan balat[edit] balat davar balat davar, shallan's brother, is torturing various small animals in the gardens of their family's estate. he reflects on how shallan is doing most of the work to save their family and tries to convince himself that he isn't a coward for remaining at home to manage the estate. he admits to some resentment of shallan because of all of their siblings, she was the only one their father never truly got angry at, but is shortly interrupted in his thoughts by wikim, another brother, coming to find him with the announcement that they have a big problem. interlude i-3: the glory of ignorance[edit] szeth szeth is now serving a man named took, who uses him to gain the admiration of mine workers (and free drinks) in the small towns they pass through. as a demonstration of szeth's total obedience, he has him do various things, such as jump up and down and cut his own arm. when he orders szeth to kill himself, szeth informs him that he cannot be ordered to kill himself, and returns to his own thoughts. the others are shocked at how refined his speech is and are slightly discomfited, associating him with the lighteyes. szeth reflects that his speech and mannerisms may well be part of the reason that his masters never keep him for long, since his masters know that he is capable of so much more than they are using him for, and that in many ways, he is much more refined and intelligent than they are. szeth revels in his common labor, though, as it means that he is not being used to spill more blood. as the night passes on and it becomes apparent that the townsfolk are no longer really listening to took's stories, took and szeth leave. however, on the way out of town, took is killed by a group of thugs, who consider selling szeth to the slavers. then one of them picks up szeth's oathstone, and he informs them of his obligation to serve them as long as they hold it. when asked for clarification, szeth tells him that he must obey any order except to kill himself, and thinks to himself that he can't be asked to give up his shardblade either, but the man need not know that. the man muses for a moment on the possibilities he has with such a servant. part two: the illuminating storms[edit] chapter 12: unity[edit] ""old friend, i hope this missive finds you well. though, as you are now essentially immortal, i would guess that wellness on your part is something of a given."" adolin kholin adolin is on a chasmfiend hunt with dalinar, renarin, elhokar, and sadeas. he is troubled by dalinar's increasingly strange behavior, especially his fits during the highstorms, and worries that his father is going mad. sadeas also continually taunts dalinar over his lack of recent success in capturing gemhearts, which frustrates adolin. dalinar kholin meanwhile, dalinar, riding up by elhokar and sadeas, tells elhokar that if they had a proper vantage point, they could observe the progress of the soldiers crossing the chasms. elhokar charges off to a nearby rock formation, betting dalinar five broams that he can beat him there. dalinar races after him, at first thinking only of elhokar's safety, but eventually getting into the thrill of the contest. just as dalinar is about to win, he remembers the strange voice in his dreams, who he presumes to be the almighty, telling him to ""unite them."" he hesitates, and elhokar beats him to the top. when he sees how thrilled elhokar is to have beaten him, dalinar is glad to have waited. they watch the soldiers cross for a few minutes, then begin to return to the others. adolin watches their return, all the while giving orders for his men to circle around to various plateaus, securing the area. adolin dalinar and elhokar return, and adolin gives his report to them. elhokar reluctantly agrees to wait for the rest of the soldiers to cross, setting up a small awning to wait under, and conversing with his courtiers. adolin questions dalinar about the purpose and the wisdom of their hunting expedition, particularly where it leaves elhokar open to a potential parshendi ambush. dalinar replies that a victory such as a successful hunt, in a controlled, safe environment, will bolster the king's reputation and increase his self-confidence as well. just as adolin begins agreeing with him however, he voices a thought about how the alethi should be in alethkar, not on the shattered plains. this shocks and upsets adolin. after a brief conversation with the king's wit, in which wit tells dalinar that renarin is not as fragile as he thinks, dalinar and adolin meet again with elhokar and sadeas, making final preparations for the hunt. after only a few minutes conversing with bashin, the hunt master, however, dalinar and adolin realize that something is wrong. at this point, the chasmfiend they have been hunting appears, climbing onto the platform with all of the courtiers and scribes, rather than the smaller plateau the hunt was supposed to take place on. chapter 13: ten heartbeats[edit] ""i realize that you are probably still angry. that is pleasant to know. much as your perpetual health, i have come to rely upon your dissatisfaction with me. it is one of the cosmere's great constants, i should think."" dalinar dalinar, adolin, and elhokar all immediately begin to race for the chasmfiend, hoping to kill it before it can harm any bystanders. sadeas uses his grandbow, weakening it from a distance while dalinar and adolin go for its many legs and elhokar distracts it. while doing so, however, the strap on elhokar's saddle breaks, causing him to be thrown to the ground. just as he is about to be crushed by the chasmfiend, dalinar hurls himself beneath the descending claw and, with shardplate-enhanced strength, catches it, giving elhokar time to escape. adolin adolin continues to cut off its legs, and the chasmfiend is eventually unable to support its own weight. elhokar summons his shardblade once again and uses it to kill the felled chasmfiend, then harvest its gemheart. chapter 14: payday[edit] ""let me first assure you that the element is quite safe. i have found a good home for it. i protect its safety like i protect my own skin, you might say."" kaladin kaladin gets up before any of the other bridgemen, resolved that he will fight for a better existence, even in his terrible circumstances. he attempts to rouse the rest of bridge four, but none come. after kaladin physically carries moash out of the barrack, however, the rest of the bridgemen reluctantly get up. kaladin then informs the men of bridge four that instead of sleeping in each morning, they will be training, and that he intends to do everything he can to ensure that bridge four never loses another man. the other bridgemen all refuse to participate in kaladin's training once gaz informs them that they don't have to. kaladin goes to gaz and gets his pay for the week, returning one of his five spheres as a bribe. gaz tells kaladin that he has no authority and will be unable to sway the bridgemen, then leaves. kaladin, worried that gaz may decide kaladin is more trouble than he's worth and kill him, asks syl to watch over him at night and wake him if gaz tries anything. kaladin then proceeds to spend his morning training, jogging back and forth across the lumberyard with an unfinished board of a bridge. he does this for several hours before meeting several of the men from bridge four to dismiss them for lunch. syl informs kaladin that she is changing, becoming better at remembering things and understanding new concepts and abstract ideas. kaladin realizes that she feels much the way about her new understanding of life as he does about his current position -- afraid to continue, but sure that he can't go back. chapter 15: the decoy[edit] ""you do not agree with my quest. i understand that, so much as it is possible to understand someone with whom i disagree so completely."" adolin adolin is overseeing the cleanup four hours after the chasmfiend attack while the group waits for a bridge crew to come, replacing the bridge the chasmfiend had destroyed in its rampage. he reflects that many of the other lighteyes are treating dalinar slightly more respectfully and carefully after his earlier rescue of elhokar, and thinks to himself that it can't last. having finished his rounds, he approaches elhokar's pavilion to give his final casualty report. dalinar in the pavilion, elhokar chides dalinar for not making serious efforts to win gemhearts, comparing him to sadeas. eventually, the conversation deteriorates to taunting, until adolin calls sadeas a coward. sadeas in turn calls renarin useless, nearly sparking a duel and possibly a war then and there, until he retracts his statement. wit appears and taunts sadeas for a while before actually praising renarin's intelligence. adolin adolin and dalinar then go to examine the strap of elhokar's saddle to see if it could have been cut. adolin wonders why they're bothering until he realizes that elhokar believes that the strap was cut as an assassination attempt, at which point he remarks on elhokar's increasing paranoia. dalinar tells adolin to take the strap to a leatherworker to examine, to talk to the grooms about the saddle, and to double the king's guard. adolin wonders whether sadeas is behind the cut strap. dalinar then approaches highprince vamah, manipulating him into making greater use of elhokar's soulcasters, ensuring continued income for elhokar. sadeas approaches dalinar to tell him of the success of their manipulation of vamah, and adolin realizes that the two of them had planned the entire thing between them. after a brief argument, adolin and dalinar leave. dalinar then tells adolin that though he hates sadeas, he's certain that he wouldn't hurt elhokar. dalinar reveals that sadeas was the decoy the night of gavilar's assassination, attempting to lead szeth away so gavilar could escape. he then tells adolin that sadeas has sworn to protect elhokar at any cost, then further discusses gavilar's assassination and his final words. elhokar approaches, asking if they've learned anything about the saddle. he and dalinar then begin arguing, elhokar insisting that someone is trying to kill him and dalinar insisting that elhokar is simply overreacting. dalinar elhokar leaves, and dalinar sends adolin to prepare the soldiers to move. as he begins to make his way back to camp, dalinar reflects on his failure to determine the meaning of gavilar's last words and his desire to protect elhokar. chapter 16: cocoons[edit] kaladin kaladin is talking to his friend laral about his father's plans for him to be a surgeon. laral encourages him to become a soldier and win a shardplate and blade for himself. tien interrupts their conversation and gives kaladin a rock, intended to make him feel better. tien and kaladin then go hunting for lurgs, a type of small, slimy creature. kaladin and laral go to talk to some of the other boys, questioning why they aren't working in the fields like usual. jost, another boy, claims that his father was cheated out of a shardblade, but kaladin insists that the area where his father fought wouldn't have had any shardbearers, and jost's father must be remembering wrong. jost gets angry and challenges kaladin to fight him. kaladin gets in a few good hits, and is surprised by how good the quarterstaff feels in his hands, but he is outmatched by jost. tien helps him up, and they return home. there, kaladin is informed that brightlord wistiow, the citylord and laral's father, is dead. he left kaladin a large number of spheres for him to go to kharbranth, be trained as a surgeon, then return to hearthstone to serve the people there with his new knowledge. chapter 17: a bloody red sunset[edit] ""might i be quite frank? before, you asked why i was so concerned. it is for the following reason:"" kaladin visits an apothecary, hoping to get some antiseptic. he is charging considerably more than kaladin can afford, so he only gets some bandages and sewing materials. he has only been back in camp for moments when a horn sounds, calling the bridgemen for a bridge run. though he is exhausted, each time the bridge stops, kaladin remains standing rather than collapsing to the ground as most bridgemen do. when they reach the final chasm, kaladin takes rock's position at the front of the bridge instead of taking his privileged position as bridgeleader toward the back. all four of the other men in the front row, the deathline, are hit with arrows almost immediately, but kaladin takes only minor injuries as arrows zip by him. as soon as the bridge is placed, he begins finding bridgemen who were wounded in the approach and treating their wounds. he then has his men carry the wounded back to camp on top of their bridge, removing them when they get to a chasm so the soldiers can cross. gaz objects to the idea, but kaladin gives him an extra bribe, a dun sphere that was infused just before the battle. chapter 18: highprince of war[edit] ""ati was once a kind and generous man, and you saw what became of him. rayse, on the other hand, was among the most loathsome, crafty, and dangerous individuals i had ever met."" adolin adolin is out walking with janala, the woman he has been courting. he visits the leatherworkers who were inspecting the strap from elhokar's saddle, and they tell him that the strap was almost certainly cut, but it's possible it was a buckle from the saddle itself that sliced it. a horn is sounded, signalling that a chasmfiend has been spotted close enough for dalinar's men to attempt to reach it first. adolin is disappointed when dalinar elects not to seek it. dalinar dalinar, meanwhile, is working with several of his scribes in attempting to manipulate the other highprinces into following elhokar in truth. teshav, the wife of one of his officers, questions the number of troops dalinar has set patrolling, and dalinar instructs her to set more patrolling anyway to combat the increased banditry in the area. renarin comes to talk to dalinar, and dalinar promises him that if he captures a new suit of shardplate and a shardblade, they will go to renarin, to help compensate for his blood weakness and allow him to fight like any other man. adolin adolin seeks out kadash, an ardent, to ask his opinion on dalinar's dreams during highstorms. janala leaves him, growing frustrated with his lack of attention. kadash expresses the opinion that dalinar is either going insane, or the visions are just particularly vivid products of his own mind. dalinar dalinar visits elhokar, making his reports for the day. while there, he asks elhokar how long he intends to continue the war, and suggests that he consider withdrawing. elhokar is shocked that dalinar would even consider an end to the vengeance pact. dalinar eventually backs down, instead saying they need a new approach, a way to win the war instead of simply trying to outlast the parshendi. dalinar suggests that elhokar appoint him highprince of war, and elhokar tells him he'll consider it. dalinar meets up with renarin, intending to ride back to their camp. however, before they can get there, they are forced to take shelter in one of their own barracks to avoid a highstorm. they barely make it inside before the storm hits. chapter 19: starfalls[edit] ""he holds the most frightening and terrible of all the shards. ponder on that for a time, you old reptile, and tell me if your insistence on nonintervention holds firm. because i assure you, rayse will not be similarly inhibited."" dalinar the moment the storm hits, dalinar finds that he is no longer in the barracks, but in an unfamiliar barn in the middle of a clear, cool night with only a small girl for company. the girl is terrified of something, and thinks that dalinar is her father. after a few moments of hushed conversation, a strange creature bursts through one of the walls of the barn and attacks. dalinar is able to avoid the creature long enough to grab the girl and escape to a nearby house where a woman who thinks he is her husband is waiting for him. once in the house, dalinar has the woman bar the door. shortly thereafter, however, two more of the strange creatures force their way in, and dalinar is forced to fight them off using an iron poker from the hearth. when he kills them, he notices that rather than bleeding, their wounds seem to release smoke of some sort. dalinar takes the woman, taffa, and the girl, seeli, to try to escape the creatures by moving along the course of a river. he deflects all of the woman's questions about why he doesn't remember them or their surroundings at all by saying that he hit his head in the fight. before they can arrive at the river, however, the group is attacked by more of the strange creatures. just as dalinar is about to be killed, two knights radiant appear and help him to kill the creatures. they tell him that the creatures aren't voidbringers, but rather midnight essence. they invite dalinar to urithiru to train as a radiant, then leave to help others. taffa begins to speak to dalinar, but it isn't her voice. dalinar recognizes her voice as the same voice he's heard in his previous visions, the one he suspects belongs to the almighty. the voice tells him to ""unite them,"" and offers cryptic advice, telling dalinar that it can't be of much help. dalinar asks the voice if he should continue to trust sadeas, and is told yes. dalinar continues to question the voice, but before he can receive answers, he wakes up back in the barrack on the shattered plains, surrounded by soldiers who have been holding him down, keeping him from acting out his visions. he tells them that his mind is clear and they can release him, then takes renarin and leaves. chapter 20: scarlet[edit] kaladin is performing an unexpected surgery on a girl from his village. he had fortunately been nearby when the girl was injured. he begins working to stop her bleeding. after a short time, he succeeds in stopping the bleeding, but realizes that his success was not due to his treatment but rather because the girl has died. he leaves her father to grieve over her, trying to cope with the fact that he was unable to save her. his father finds him and tells him that his work had all been good, and her death wasn't kaladin's fault. he leaves kaladin, telling him that he'll have to learn when to care and when to let go. chapter 21: why men lie[edit] ""one need only look at the aftermath of his brief visit to sel to see proof of what i say."" kaladin lies in bed, debating whether or not to get up. eventually, he forces himself up and realizes that the other bridgemen had all been watching to see if he would get up and continue his training routine from the previous day. kaladin goes to check on the wounded from the previous day's bridge run. two of them are, for the most part fine, but one of them badly needs antiseptic. kaladin washes the man's wounds with water, then goes out to perform his morning training routine. while jogging with his plank, he talks to syl. she tells him that some of his men think he's gone mad, and asks him why men lie. kaladin is unable to give her an answer. syl claims that the king's uncle doesn't lie, but kaladin cynically remarks that if someone has lighteyes, they lie. gaz approaches and tells kaladin that sadeas has ordered that his wounded men not receive food or pay for the duration of the time they can't run bridges. kaladin is furious, as this means that he'll have to find another way to care for them. kaladin goes to the men of bridge four and asks them to split their food with the wounded and to contribute their pay for medical supplies. most laugh at him and leave, but rock agrees to share some of his food with hobber, the man who he feels has the best chance of recovering, because he feels he owes kaladin for running the deathline in his place the previous day. rock also says that he can see syl, though she hasn't specifically revealed herself to him. kaladin then goes to gaz and gets his bridge crew assigned to stone-gathering duty for the day. he convinces rock and teft to help him gather knobweed reeds over the course of the afternoon. chapter 22: eyes, hands, or spheres[edit] ""in case you have turned a blind eye to that disaster, know that aona and skai are both dead, and that which they held has been splintered. presumably to prevent anyone from rising up to challenge rayse."" dalinar dalinar goes with his sons to the king's feast. adolin reports that according to the leatherworkers he consulted, the strap was cut, though it could've been an accident. they discuss the king's paranoia and dalinar refuses to talk about his episode in the highstorm, saying that perhaps it was good for the men in the barracks to witness it, as the rumors about his condition were perhaps worse than the truth. dalinar chafes at the sloppy fashionableness of the other nobles and the fact that their drunkenness is in violation of the alethi war codes. the king's wit sits on a stool at the entrance to the island and insults everyone as they go to the feast. he warns dalinar that the rumor has spread of his suggestion to the king that they retreat and abandon the vengeance pact. lady navani, gavilar's widow, unexpectedly shows up to the feast, having just arrived to the shattered plains. dalinar tries to hide his attraction to her with the utmost propriety, addressing her as a sister. king elhokar then announces that in light of the recent attempt on his life with the cut girth strap, he is appointing sadeas to highprince of information to investigate. this is to snub dalinar, who he believes is not giving the investigation serious attention. dalinar realizes that this is sadeas's way of outmaneuvering his highprince of war idea. chapter 23: many uses[edit] ""you have accused me of arrogance in my quest. you have accused me of perpetuating my grudge against rayse and bavadin. both accusations are true."" bridge four is on rock duty, finding stones to soulcast into food. kaladin has rock and teft searching for knobweed to extract the antiseptic sap from. rock, who can inexplicably see syl, finds knobweed quickly guided by her. kaladin ties bundles of the reed to the bottom of the cart to conceal them. syl comes to him excitedly, telling him that she led rock to a pile of dung as a joke. he makes small talk with the bridgecrew, trying to soften their attitude towards him, with little success. kaladin realizes that even though he has saved lives in bridge 4, no one will follow his leadership unless he finds a way to make their lives worth living. later, kaladin, rock, and teft sneak into the wagonyard to retrieve the knobweed. relieved that it's still there and not too dried out, they head to where syl found the chipped, discarded liquor bottles to use for the knobweed sap. they then head to the honor chasm to squeeze the sap into the bottles. while working, they talk. teft asks kaladin why he tries to lead the bridgecrew. kaladin says that the responsibilities of the bridgeleader are his to decide. kaladin asks rock how he came to be a bridgeman. rock tells him that his leader, or nuatoma, dueled highprince sadeas to try to win his shardplate. when he lost, rock, his cousin and servant, was bound to sadeas. he was a cook, until he snuck chull dung into sadeas's food, which caused his fall to bridgeman status. teft asks kaladin for his story explaining why he is a bridgeman. kaladin says that he killed a man, though it wasn't murder and he was thanked by someone important. he cryptically says that he is a bridgeman because a lighteyes did not take it well when he turned down a gift. chapter 24: the gallery of maps[edit] ""neither point makes the things i have written to you untrue."" dalinar dalinar stands in the king's gallery of maps, waiting for highprince roion to come and meet him. dalinar's ultimate goal is to follow his visions by uniting the highprinces, and he thinks he can start by working with another prince on a joint plateau assault. since roion has won the fewest gemhearts of all the princes, dalinar tries to convince him that working together would be more effective. roion is suspicious of this because he is afraid dalinar will take any gemhearts and shards for himself. dalinar compromises, saying that they will split gemhearts and that the first set of plate can go to roion. roion rebuffs this offer, instead insinuating that dalinar is growing weak and deluded by his lapses from sanity during highstorms. roion says he'll think about a joint assault and leaves. adolin a few minutes later, as dalinar is thinking about how to discover what gavilar's last words really meant, adolin meets dalinar. he asks him how the meeting went and when dalinar tells him that it went poorly, adolin tells him that sadeas is asking for permission to enter their warcamp to investigate the threat to the king. adolin is worried that he may create false evidence framing dalinar, but dalinar tells adolin to allow him to because his vision said to trust sadeas. at this, adolin becomes irate, telling dalinar that to stake the future of their house on hallucinations is folly. adolin shouts at dalinar that his visions are just figments of his imagination. dalinar tells adolin to leave. chapter 25: the butcher[edit] kal overhears some villagers speaking poorly of his father's work, accusing him of stealing the spheres and suspicious of how lirin can write. kal meets with his mother, hesina, who tells him not to hate the villagers for repeating what they have heard. they respect lirin but are intimidated by his status as second nahn. kal realizes his parents had hoped to marry him off to laral. he can't decide if he wants to be a soldier or a surgeon. the new citylord, brightlord roshone, arrives. he is less than pleased to be in a backwater city. he blames lirin for his predicament because lirin let wistiow die. lirin and hesina don't know if things are better or worse for them with this new citylord. chapter 26: stillness[edit] ""i am being chased. your friends of the seventeenth shard, i suspect. i believe they're still lost, following a false trail i left for them. they'll be happier that way. i doubt they have any inkling what to do with me should they actually catch me."" dalinar brightness litima reads the the way of kings to dalinar. renarin is with him. listening usually comforts dalinar, but not this time. it reminds him of adolin's arguments. dalinar is disturbed by the nature of his visions. dalinar tells renarin that highprince aladar refused his offer of an alliance, just as roion did. horns sounds outside. dalinar enters the war room and gives teleb an order to march. teleb presses dalinar on the idea of using faster bridges carried by men, and he finally relents and gives teleb permission to recruit and train one crew. sadeas comes to interview dalinar's soldiers. he is insistent that the investigation continue despite the imminent battle, so he follows dalinar and his army. dalinar and sadeas talk about the thrill. usually men don't speak about it. dalinar summons oathbringer and together with adolin they attack the parshendi. the thrill gives him strength, focus, and power until he feels a sudden stab of powerful revulsion to the scene of death around him. he forces himself to continue to fight but feels sick. dalinar hears a voice saying ""life before death,"" but nobody is near enough. he starts to fight for his men. dalinar wins the battle and adolin takes the gemheart. dalinar is looking eastward, toward the origin, when he notices a group of parshendi on a nearby plateau. among them is a large parshendi wearing shardplate. dalinar wonders why the shardbearer hadn't participated in the battle. the group flees toward their base at the center of the plains. chapter 27: chasm duty[edit] ""if anything i have said makes a glimmer of sense to you, i trust that you'll call them off. or maybe you could astound me and ask them to do something productive for once."" kaladin visits the apothecary again to sell his knobweed sap. the apothecary pretends that ""wild"" knobweed isn't as effective and tries to swindle kaladin. with the help of syl, he sees through the ruse and gets a better price. he considers escaping, but he can't bring himself to leave the bridgemen. gaz has changed bridge four's work duty to chasm duty because the other bridges resent them for getting away with breaking rules by bringing back wounded. down in the chasms they have to look for corpses to get their equipment and whatever else can be found. kaladin, teft and rock walk ahead talking. they find dunny listening, try to make him participate, and it works. as the tension eases, they discover that dunny can sing. the other crew members still remain aloof. eventually they find a lot of corpses and begin their morbid work. kaladin picks up a spear and gets overwhelmed by his memories. at first, most of the others jeer him for pretending to be their leader, but after he finishes his kata, they stare in amazement. remembering that they have work to do or they'll get in trouble, he drops the spear and tells them to get to work. teft is clearly impressed, but kaladin down plays the issue. later, syl looks with rock and dunny for more corpses and they find parshendi. they discover that the parshendi's armor is grown from their bodies. the crew finishes their chasm duty and goes back to the ladders. kaladin muses how to get the crew together and comes up with an idea. back at the barracks he and rock buy a cauldron and supplies and rock cooks an evening stew for all the men of bridge four. one by one they all eventually come out of the barrack and sit around the fire, eating rock's stew. the next morning, many more members of kaladin's crew get up early to work out. chapter 28: decision[edit] ""for i have never been dedicated to a more important purpose, and the very pillars of the sky will shake with the results of our war here. i ask again. support me. do not stand aside and let disaster consume more lives. i've never begged you for something before, old friend.i do so now."" adolin while on an inspection adolin studies his father and worries about what he sees. teleb demonstrates a prototype of a new portable bridge which fails. adolin encourages him to continue working on the design. as they move off to start inspections, dalinar wonders why there are no shards for ordinary people and asks adolin if he feels the thrill. on their way to the fifth battalion, adolin praises his father's decision to allow the soldiers to bring their families to the shattered plains. dalinar muses about the political and economic impact of the continual harvesting of gemstones and de facto colonization of the shattered plains. he tells adolin that soon he will have to consider this. after inspecting the 5th battalion, havrom leads them to the ten soldiers that were questioned by sadeas. dalinar pointedly delegates the interrogation to adolin. it becomes clear that the grooms' loyalty to dalinar probably made the situation worse -- they only offered blanket denials to sadeas. dalinar asks tadet to interview the men separately and find out specifics. adolin then questions why dalinar keeps giving him the lead. dalinar tells him that he has a decision to make, but before he can elaborate, he notices a messenger in thanadal's colors. the messenger informs dalinar that thanadal has to cancel their meeting. dalinar presses the messenger, and he says he is instructed to say that thanadal does not wish to do a joint plateau assault with him. all eight highprinces have refused his offer, leaving only sadeas. he tells adolin to continue the inspection without him, making a vague excuse about something that needs to be done. dalinar dalinar is confident that his son will do well as highprince as he tries to decide whether he should abdicate. he orders niter to bring him his war hammer, then orders some workers out of the new latrine pit. he uses the hammer to work on the latrine himself so he can think through his decision. he worries about how he is losing his thirst for battle and how the book, the codes, and the visions have changed him and how the others are regarding him and by extension his sons. as he gets to the end of his work, he feels that he is close to a decision. he is interrupted by navani. she reminds him that he had an appointment with her. he continues to work, and she eventually gets him to apologize. she tells him that jasnah's spanreed is flashing. he quits work on the latrine and they go to take the ""call."" as they walk to the viewing room, she hints at starting a relationship, but dalinar refuses, holding to the tradition that a widowed sister-in-law is a sister in truth. dalinar is surprised to find adolin, along with his clerks and their attendants, also already in his sitting chamber. adolin introduces his new love interest and clerk danlan morakotha. he and jasnah have a short exchange about their family, then jasnah asks him to repeat his first encounter with the parshendi, seven years ago. she also wants to know when he first saw shardblades in their possession. he replies that he only saw them after gavilar's death. she then has her new ward (shallan) draw what is referred to in a book as a voidbringer, although she doesn't believe it to be one. dalinar and adolin identify it as a chasmfiend. dalinar urges jasnah to come back to the shattered plains as soon as possible. the conversation ends, and he finds himself alone with navani. he reveals that he is going to abdicate. she believes that to be a big mistake. interludes[edit] interlude i-4: rysn[edit] rysn rysn and her babsk vstim visit shinovar to trade with the shin. she's annoyed at the strange grass that doesn't retract. vstim has her set up a fabrial that warns when people are approaching. when the shin arrive, she thinks the guards are servants because they are dressed plainly, and vstim explains that shin farmers are highest in the social order and warriors are the lowest. vstim offers thresh scraps of soulcast metal in exchange for chickens and other valuable exotic goods. the metal is certified to be soulcast from organic materials and not mined. vstim asks if thresh has another servant like the one he gave him seven years ago that was so obedient. thresh says that he was a worthless truthless (szeth) and that he hoped there wouldn't be another one like him. interlude i-5: axies the collector[edit] axies the collector axies the collector wakes up in an alley in kasitor lying in rotting garbage. he had gotten drunk the night before to see if he could spot alespren, and he's been deposited here, naked. he manages to grab a ratty blanket from an insane beggar and walks out into the streets, drawing stares. he heads to the docks, where many people are waiting. cusicesh the protector appears in the water, leaving him feeling drained. a street urchin grabs his blanket, leaving him naked again. he's hauled off to jail, content at having seen two new spren. perhaps he will finally see the elusive captivityspren. interlude i-6: a work of art[edit] szeth szeth sits in a gambling den as his owner, makkek, parades about with a woman on each arm. he has grown fat and rich since coming into possession of szeth. he gives a signal to szeth, and he heads out on his latest assassination assignment: gavashaw, a new arrival in town who had hoped to challenge makkek with his own gambling den. he sneaks into his house and hears nothing in his room, so he sends in a decoy -- a wooden knob ""dressed"" in a robe (curtain) -- by lashing it to the far wall. the decoy isn't attacked, so he slinks into the room, finding gavashaw's severed head. a new master is there, who produces makkek's head and szeth's oathstone. he is given a list of high ranking noble men to assassinate. part three: dying[edit] chapter 29: errorgance[edit] ""the ones of ash and fire, who killed like a swarm, relentless before the heralds"" shallan shallan is talking to her brothers and balat davar's betrothed, eylita tavinar over spanreed, in her quarters, discussing how to get to jasnah's soulcaster. she considers how difficult it will be for her not to fall in love with the freedom and the studying, when balat informs her, after having sent his brothers out, that luesh has died. he also tells her that some ""friends"" of their fathers came by some weeks later ""suggesting"" balat should return the soulcaster. balat believes that they are the owners of the soulcaster and are very dangerous. balat has eylita draw a picture of a symbol found on a pendant worn by luesh; he also mentions that one of the ""friends"" had the same pattern tattooed on his thumb. the conversation ends, and shallan burns the transcript in the sitting room's fireplace before heading back to her studies. five hours later as she is studying the alethi monarchy. she tells jasnah that she thinks the authors are ""errorgant"". jasnah informs her that this is the ""assuredness movement"" in which the authors overstated their cases. shallan wonders why she is researching events as recent as the murder of king gavilar, to which jasnah replies that she thought to ease shallan into true scholarship this way. the discussion moves on to shallan's habit of saying the first passable clever thing that comes into her mind and the incompetence of her former tutors and their punishments. jasnah believes wit would find her amusing. they move on and talk about what shallan has learned about gavilar's murder, and later about youth and scholarship. shallan wonders what it is that jasnah is working on. two hours later taravangian comes to their balcony joining them at lunch. after jasnah breaks the silence with a question about his granddaughter, he asks about jasnah's soulcaster, but jasnah evades the question. he then asks shallan if she could do a drawing of him, which he intends as a gift for his granddaughter. while shallan is drawing, taravangian and jasnah discuss the almighty, jasnah's lack of faith, and the concept of right and wrong. when inspecting her finished picture shallan realizes that she has drawn some creatures with symbols as heads (cryptics). she hurriedly crumples the page and claims to have made a mistake. she offers to do a new one for the king by the end of the day. after the king has left, jasnah and shallan have a talk about him, during which jasnah claims not to be closed to the possibility that she might join a devotary at some point. the two continue the discussion about faith for a short while before jasnah tells shallan to get on with her sketch for the king. chapter 30: darkness unseen[edit] ""they were suddenly dangerous. like a calm day that became a tempest."" kaladin kaladin leaves the barracks with the first light of the day in rather good spirits, as he is followed by all twenty nine members of bridge four. he thinks that the last holdout bisig might have been bullied by teft and rock but chooses to ignore it. kaladin has the bridgemen do exercises from his military days, stretches and jumping motion for warm up. several carpenters and soldiers are watching and laughing at them. kaladin notices gaz before deciding that there's still some time before breakfast to practice hauling the bridge. gaz gaz is contemplating on the loss of his eye and what the ensuing darkness could be hiding, when lamaril calls him over, to pay his bribe. gaz only has half of it, one topaz mark, but lamaril is more interested in kaladin, noting him as a problem for gaz. gaz is unsettled by bridge four's training and wonders if kaladin really did train in the military. gaz and lamaril discuss the use of bridgemen and that kaladin could become more dangerous. gaz offers to kill him, but worries about the loss of kaladin's bribes. lamaril tells him not to because that would just make the young bridgeleader into a martyr. he wants kaladin to fall on a run. before leaving he threatens gaz with making him a bridgeman himself. gaz worries that if kaladin does get killed, he, gaz might still end up a bridgeman for not being able to pay off his debt to lamaril. kaladin kaladin and bridge four are practicing setting the bridge down from a raised position and kaladin is wondering what it would take for them to practice on a real chasm. he is surprised how good they are considering they have only been training for two weeks. as he sends his team for a break he considers that the last two weeks were in part lucky since they had only two runs and on one they were late. on the other one they ""only"" lost two men, amark and koolf, and only had two wounded, narm and peet, but he worries that they only have twenty-five members who can carry since five are wounded in all. syl joins him telling him that she saw gaz and lamaril talking and didn't like the look of them, though she didn't hear what was being said. considering his men's protection, kaladin is studying a half finished bridge thinking about using it as a shield. he tells teft, rock, skar and moash about using a ""side carry."" it's very awkward to carry that way, so they ask him why they should try it. he doesn't reveal his shield idea but instead tells them it's so they can use different muscles. before leaving, moash wants to know why kaladin made him a squad leader. after kaladin tells him it's because he's strong-willed, he tells kaladin that he doesn't trust or like him but is obeying because he's curious what will happen. gaz gaz is stunned as he sees bridge four do the ""side carry."" he waves kaladin over and demands an explanation. kaladin gives him the excuse about utilizing different muscles. gaz realizes that this might get kaladin killed on an actual assault and suggests that they should try it on a run. chapter 31: beneath the skin[edit] a drunken lirin tells kal not to come back to hearthstone after his studies at kharbranth. kal wonders if the reason that the people mistrust lirin was because he looked under people's skin as a profession. he is angry that at a word from roshone, people stopped giving donations to their family. kal suggests they should spend the spheres, but his father is against it. he and hesina even tried to get kal accepted for an early admission, but the surgeons at kharbranth refused. lirin and kal talk about the difference between roshone and wistiow. after that kal gets back to his studies. he pulls a rock out of his pocket and thinks of tien. tien has been learning carpentry from ral since he won't be able to learn surgery -- he can't stand the sight of blood. as kal's thoughts wander to becoming a spearman, he is interrupted by banging on the door. it turns out to be a mob of villagers including luten, horl and balsas, demanding the spheres that lirin has stolen. lirin confronts them, daring them to rob and attack him. the villagers melt away into the darkness outside. chapter 32: side carry[edit] ""they lived high atop a place no man could reach, but all could visit. the tower city itself, crafted by the hands of no man."" lopen joins bridge four. he and dabbid bring a water cart for the first time. near the final assault, kaladin sees that the parshendi are already set up. he realizes that if they lose a couple more men, the bridge could topple and crush the entire crew. kaladin orders bridge four to do the side-carry technique to prevent them from being killed. bridge four succeeds and none of them die, however kaladin realizes that he undermined the entire assault. most of the other bridges fell, either due to the concentrated fire from the parshendi or their unpracticed attempts at emulating bridge four. only a few bridges land, and when they do they are scattered. sadeas's forces are separated from each other and are forced to retreat. lamaril and gaz show up with some men, ready to execute kaladin on the spot. kaladin instead convinces them he will be needed alive, to convince sadeas that it wasn't their idea. lamaril orders that kaladin be beaten as bridge four watches. his dun spheres are scattered from a kick to his belt pouch. chapter 33: cymatics[edit] ""they changed, even as we fought them. like shadows they were, that can transform as the flame dances. never underestimate them because of what you first see."" shallan shallan is thinking about how she sometimes gets distracted by the enormity of the palanaeum. along with a parshman servant, she is on her way to get a copy of dialogues, though she now has an hour each day to do her own research. she has decided on natural science. she thinks about how she could fill gaps in her understanding and has to remind herself that her true goal is to steal jasnah's soulcaster. hiding in one of the library rooms, she goes through some of the sketches she has of jasnah soulcasting and hopes that with it she will be able to create the mineral deposits to save her family. comparing her expectation of jasnah the heretic and the real one, shallan worries that she might not be able to actually do it. she speculates about talking to jasnah about the use of a soulcaster but is startled by a light and decides to get back to her task. she realizes that she's in the room where she can find shadows remembered. she was surprised to find that it contained children's stories. when shallan returns to the alcove, she finds that jasnah has not yet returned, but to her surprise kabsal is present. apparently he wants to show something to jasnah, but has some bread and simberry jam to share with shallan. after a discussion about the meaning of the jam and shallan's personality, they move on to shallan's appearance and what she thinks of herself. they also discuss jasnah's heresy. shallan considers kabsal in a romantic light for a short time before dismissing it. kabsal tries to get shallan to switch devotaries even though it is apparently frowned upon to recruit. kabsal intended to show jasnah proof of the almighty, which shallan is curious to see. he gets out a book where he shows her four patterns of the cities kholinar, vedenar, thaylen city, and akinah. using a metal plate with sand and a bow, he recreates the patterns in the sand through the resonance, telling her that this is called cymatics. telling her of more examples he considers proof, he guides the conversation to saving her soul. when jasnah appears she is not surprised to see kabsal but not pleased either. she reveals that she knows about cymatics but doesn't seem impressed by it. after kabsal is gone, jasnah warns shallan that kabsal is only interested in shallan to get to jasnah and her soulcaster. chapter 34: stormwall[edit] ""i walked from abamabar to urithiru."" kaladin gains consciousness to find himself tied upside down by his ankles outside the barrack. syl tells him that lamaril was executed and gaz was left in his position. kaladin is to be judged by the stormfather -- left out in the highstorm to see if he will survive. syl leaves and comes back with rock, teft and moash. they tell kaladin about the disaster caused by the side carry of bridge four. they say that bridge four will remember kaladin for what he had done, and that they will not go back to how they were before. kaladin, just a bit light in the head after being beaten and hung up upside down, tells them he will survive. though there is a very little chance of surviving a highstorm outside, they want to believe him. finally teft gives him a dun sphere as a kind of lucky charm before the three retreat to the barracks. the stormwall arrives. chapter 35: a light by which to see[edit] ""though many wished urithiru to be built in alethela, it was obvious that it could not be. and so it was that we asked for it to be placed westward, in the place nearest to honor."" kaladin the stormwall hits kaladin, flings him around, presses him against the side of the barrack. when he screams, the coldness of the storm courses into his mouth. he clutches the sphere as if his life depends on it. syl stays by his side and tells him to grab the roof. he does and comes to lay on the roof. for more grip he snatches the ring where his ropes are tied to and fights against being cast down by the highstorm, always clutching the sphere. in some brief moments he sees syl standing before him as if trying to hold back the storm. his grip grows numb and he's flung about again. he sees a brief vision of an enormous face. kaladin feels a deep chill running through his body. he looks at the sphere now glowing brightly. he falls unconscious. teft after the highstorm subsides, rock leaves the barracks, followed by teft. though they had wanted to believe that kaladin could survive the highstorm, they didn't expect it. they find kaladin, his body in terrible shape. his eyes snap open. the bridgemen gasp and fall to the ground in shock. rock yells for the others to help get him down. teft sees kaladin dropping the sphere. it is dun. chapter 36: the lesson[edit] ""taking the dawnshard, known to bind any creature voidish or mortal, he crawled up the steps crafted for heralds, ten strides tall apiece, toward the grand temple above."" shallan shallan almost steals jasnah's soulcaster while serving as her bathing attendant, but can't do it. jasnah decides to teach shallan philosophy hands-on by taking a walk at night in a dangerous part of town. when attacked by murderers, jasnah soulcasts one of the men to fire. as the frightened attackers leave, jasnah soulcasts another to crystal and uses stormlight lightning to kill the last two. after returning to their rooms, a shaken shallan decides that jasnah doesn't deserve to use a holy thing like the soulcaster and swaps it out with her broken soulcaster. chapter 37: sides[edit] kal helps his mother with the cooking as tien shows off another pretty stone he has found. kal immediately leaves when he sees a carriage from roshone come to pick up his father. he insists on coming along. lirin is surprised because kal shouldn't have known about it but lets him join. this meeting is about the spheres that lirin got from the former citylord wistiow. lirin and kal sit down to eat with roshone, but lirin refuses to eat. he and roshone argue about the spheres, roshone offering a settlement: he takes nine-tenths, leaving the rest to lirin. kaladin is indignant and is dismissed from the table by his father. kal goes to the kitchen and meets laral and roshone's son rillir. he treats kal like a servant and laral plays along initially. when kaladin refuses to serve him, he continues to taunt him. laral pleads with him to stop, and they leave. his experience with the haughty lighteyes has changed his mind again: he wants to be a surgeon, not a soldier. while on the way home lirin tells kal that he made roshone believe that he probably will bend on the topic of these spheres. kaladin realizes that it's a tactic designed to make him focus on a deal rather than proving the truth -- that the spheres really were stolen. kaladin is shocked to belong to a family of thieves. lirin justifies it by saying that wistiow would have given him the spheres anyway. kal makes another decision that night: he starts going with his full name ""kaladin,"" for it is a man's name. chapter 38: envisager[edit] ""born from the darkness, they bear its taint still, marked upon their bodies much as the fire marks their souls."" kaladin kaladin lies in bridge four's barrack, suffering fever from the wounds he got being strung up in the highstorm. most of the time he's unconscious. in his rare lucid moments he sees deathspren, and syl, a small figure of pure white light holding a sword made of light. she fights the deathspren with her sword and wards them off. kaladin just wants to relax and die, but he fights to survive because he doesn't want to fail bridge four like he did tien, dallet, and others. he notices more deathspren each time he is lucid enough to see them. teft skar watches over kaladin. they keep a guard on him at all times to keep away prying eyes and possible assassination attempts. teft comes to relieve him to test a theory, a belief he once rejected as a child of envisagers. he puts three diamond spheres into kaladin's hand, then waits. when he nearly thinks that he wasn't right, kaladin gasps, breathing in stormlight. teft sees stormlight rising from kaladin's body, knitting some of the wounds. the stormlight is depleted quickly, but kaladin seems more relaxed than before with more color to his skin. teft curses kaladin for revealing the truth to him now, in this place. he knows that kaladin can heal, but he has to do it carefully, a little at a time, to conceal what is happening. chapter 39: burned into her[edit] ""within a heartbeat, alezarv was there, crossing a distance that would have taken more than four months to travel by foot."" shallan shallan is sitting in her room restlessly drawing the deaths of the four robbers from three nights ago, even though she didn't deliberately take the memories. as she draws, she thinks about different concepts of logic and philosophy, considering jasnah's actions and reasons in the context of the different schools of thought. she also worries about her own actions in stealing the soulcaster in the same way. her mind wanders for a while and she looks at what she's been drawing. she's shocked to see a completely different scene being sketched -- one of a richly-dressed man lying in a pool of blood. panicked, she hurries from the room and runs into a servant who informs her that one of her spanreeds is flashing and hands it over to her. going into the main room, she is glad to find her brother balat talking to her. she tells him that she has managed to steal the soulcaster but hasn't left yet so as not to draw suspicion onto herself. balat informs her that the ""friends"" of their father visited again. shallan frets even more about the theft and when a chambermaid comes to their quarters, she starts worrying about the soulcaster's safety. she decides to put it into her safe-pouch and leaves the room with a basket full of bread and bluebar jam left by kabsal. two hours later sitting in the palace gardens, shallan has calmed down and is drawing some snails and plants. she notes the symbiotic relationship between a snail she is drawing and the shalebark it is on, writing it down next to her drawing. after making sure she is alone, she gets the soulcaster out to try to puzzle out how to use it since luesh can no longer show them how. she has no luck and tries to think of other ways to get it to work or save her family. chapter 40: eyes of red and blue[edit] ""death upon the lips. sound upon the air. char upon the skin."" kaladin leaves the barrack for the first time after his judgment in the highstorm. he is fairly weak, but his wounds are mostly gone. the members of bridge four, doing daily bridge training, nearly stumble over one another when they see him. moash tells him that it's only been ten days and rock says kaladin must have bones like granite. when the horns blow for a bridge run and bridge four -- on duty -- gathers, kaladin joins them, helping lopen and dabbid with the water. later he watches the battle, thinking about what he did with the side carry and comes to understand what's the purpose of bridgemen: to be bait for the parshendi because bridgemen are cheaper than soldiers and don't need training and equipment. later that evening, bridge four gives rock a razor as a gift for his making the stew every evening. with tears in his eyes, he runs into the barrack, leaving the others wondering if the gift was a good idea. dunny starts to serve the stew to the others. only sigzil doesn't join in, so kaladin seeks him out for a conversation. he tells kaladin about marabethia and their method of execution. eventually rock comes back, shaved, happy and grateful and tells bridge four that he will shave everybody who wants it. kaladin despairs that the old wretch is coming back because he knows the bridgemen really have no chance to survive. chapter 41: of alds and milp[edit] brightlord roshone and his son rillir were attacked by whitespine while on a hunt. rillir is mortally wounded. lirin tries to save him, but realizes it is hopeless, so he turns his attention to roshone, who demands that he go back to helping his son. lirin refuses, explaining the guidelines of a surgeon with two patients: if the wounds are equal, treat the youngest first; if the wounds are not equally threatening, treat the worst wound first. the third guideline supersedes the first two: a surgeon must know when someone is beyond their ability to help. while stitching up part of roshone's wound, lirin's knife is dangerously close to a major artery. he hesitates and his hand shakes, but he continues and saves roshone's life. kaladin asks lirin later why he didn't cut the artery and let roshone die, as it would've solved all of their problems. lirin says it would have been murder, and he is not a killer. even if the lighteyes don't care about life, somebody has to start caring. kaladin realizes that, given the option, he would have let roshone die. he decides that just as some body parts are beyond repair in a surgery, some people need to be removed. chapter 42: beggars and barmaids[edit] ""like a highstorm, regular in their coming, yet always unexpected."" shallan shallan tells jasnah that she thinks she was technically right to kill the footpads, but she acted immorally and unethically. jasnah is satisfied that shallan has learned a good deal from the lesson and dismisses her for the rest of the day. it's been two weeks since the soulcaster was stolen, and shallan is puzzled that jasnah hasn't seemed to react at all. back in her chambers, she attempts to use the soulcaster while humming for half an hour. she wonders if jasnah might have duped her with a fake. she takes a break and starts sketching, and she suddenly hears a voice asking ""what are you?"" a maid cracks open the door, and shallan convinces herself that she must have interpreted the random sounds of cleaning nearby as words. she scolds the maid for going into jasnah's room, then sends her off to tell jasnah so she can enter herself. she hurries in hoping to find notes on soulcasting. she instead finds a notebook focused on natanatan, the unclaimed hills, and the shattered plains. the two others contain notes on urithiru and the voidbringers. shallan wonders why a nonbeliever like jasnah would concern herself with what she herself considers fables. a knock on the door reveals kabsal, who having heard that she has free time, brought some bread and jam for a picnic. kabsal explains the stories behind the truthberry jam. shallan laments that she isn't much of a scholar since she prefers the outdoors. kabsal starts flirting, and although shallan thinks that it wouldn't work out for them, she encourages him. he implies that he might leave the ardentia for her. shallan steers the conversation to jasnah. he reveals that his initial plan was to get shallan to help him steal her soulcaster, but his superiors disapproved. they were afraid that elhokar might start a war with kharbranth. shallan probes for some hints on how to use it. he says you only have to tap a gem and touch the object you wish to change, but jasnah doesn't do that. kabsal leaves and shallan returns inside, finding a note from captain tozbek informing her that he will arrive in one week. she wants to study as much as possible before leaving, so she goes back to jasnah to read. chapter 43: the wretch[edit] ""they lived out in the wilds, always awaiting the desolation-or sometimes, a foolish child who took no heed of the night's darkness."" kaladin wakes up feeling dread and despair, as he realizes that all of the bridgemen are simply bait, destined to die. he finds the rest of the men lined up and waiting for him to lead them in practice. before he can tell them how useless it is, he sees lamaril's replacement: brightlord matal and his wife hashal. hashal speaks for her husband and tells kaladin that the almighty has simply given kaladin another chance to prove himself as a bridgeman, nothing more. she claims that her husband is a well respected and honored associate of sadeas, and kaladin wonders out loud how he ended up in this position. hashal directs one of her men to beat him, but kaladin catches the spear aimed at him. in his mind he sees how to beat not only the soldier attacking him but his three companions as well, but decides against it, letting go of the spear and letting the next hit land. she informs them that they'll only be doing chasm duty from now on. kaladin climbs down into the chasm. syl wonders why he isn't happy from surviving the highstorm. kaladin chafes from not fighting the soldiers, but it wouldn't have helped to protect the men. syl vaguely remembers helping men kill, to kaladin's shock. sometimes it is right to kill. the rest of the men climb down and kaladin starts walking. rock asks what they are going to do next in order to fight, and kaladin insists that the fight is over. they find a pile of bodies and get to work. teft stops by and also asks what's next, and kaladin angrily replies that there is no hope, leading some of the men to grumble. teft argues that it's not about surviving, quoting part of the radiant oath ""journey before destination."" syl likes the saying and encourages kaladin to not give up. kaladin thinks for a while and finally decides to try again, announcing to the men that the only chance is to try to escape. he offers to train them as spearmen, hoping it will increase their poor odds of escaping. all but rock eagerly agree. fighting is beneath rock; he will cook instead. chapter 44: the weeping[edit] kaladin lays on the roof after making a temporary repair. tien joins him and gives him a beautifully carved wooden horse. kaladin worries because his father had to spend another sphere. their mother comes out and joins them, trying to assuage his concerns. the only reason he spent one was to try to bluff roshone into thinking they were growing desperate. they discuss his future prospects, including the possibility of pursuing other professions, but kaladin is set on becoming a surgeon like his father. lirin comes out and tells them there is a gathering in the square. when they arrive, they notice that laral is engaged, apparently to roshone himself. kaladin is appalled and starts forward to ""stop it,"" but lirin tells him to stand down. roshone announces that amaram is here to recruit, and several young men volunteer. the quota is not met, however, so amaram tells roshone to read the list of conscripts. the last name read is tien. amaram is familiar with the situation and asks roshone to provide a different name, but roshone insists. kaladin tries to volunteer to take his place, but again roshone insists that tien be conscripted. so kaladin instead volunteers in order to protect him. he is relieved, but their parents walk away devastated and crying. kaladin swears an oath that he'll bring back tien in four years. chapter 45: shadesmar[edit] ""yelig-nar, called blightwind, was one that could speak like a man, though often his voice was accompanied by the wails of those he consumed."" shallan shallan continues her study of gavilar's meetings with the parshendi before his death. she notices a discrepancy about gavilar's uncharacteristic scholarly interest in the parshendi. she plans to leave for jah keved the next day to take the stolen soulcaster to her family. under the pretense of looking for another book, she researches a little of her own about the voidbringers, knowing that it's jasnah's true research interest. after studying for a couple of hours, kabsal finds her. after a theological discussion about the voidbringers, she tells him of her plans to leave. he requests a likeness of him from her, and after paying her for it, asks for another one with himself and her in the picture. she draws two creatures in the background, with symbols for a head. frightened, she runs to her room while being pursued by the creatures, which continue to show up in her sketches as she runs through the halls. trapped in her room, she begins to summon her shardblade and one of the creatures asks her what she is. while touching a glass goblet filled with diamond spheres, her response of ""i'm terrified"" transports her to shadesmar where she soulcasts the goblet to blood. back in her room, jasnah calls to her from outside her door. terrified that she will discover her soulcasting, she cuts herself to explain the presence of the blood. chapter 46: child of tanavast[edit] ""though i was due for dinner in veden city that night, i insisted upon visiting kholinar to speak with tivbet. the tariffs through urithiru were growing quite unreasonable. by then, the so-called radiants had already begun to show their true nature."" kaladin rides the highstorm as he sweeps across roshar. in the dream kaladin views many places and people, a large portion of which he had never seen or heard of before. blowing southwest and then westward, kaladin sees flashes of lights, almost appearing to be physical things he could touch. approaching them he sees that they came from a building amidst a city built of a triangular pattern. he bursts in there and sees a man with large shin eyes, a shardblade, wearing white (szeth - the assassin in white), just after he has committed an assassination. it feels to kaladin as though the assassin could see him. nearing the western ocean, kaladin separates from the storm after hearing a booming voice that shakes the stormwall. this voice calls kaladin a child of tanavast and of honor and warns him that odium comes. kaladin asks why there is so much war, and the voice responds, ""odium reigns."" kaladin then awakes inside his barracks, held down by dark figures. he instinctively starts to fight them off before realizing they are his bridge mates. they had to hold him down to stop him from running out into the highstorm while dreaming. they all go out to bathe in the riddens, and kaladin decides to accept a shave from rock. rock reveals that sigzil is a worldsinger. bridge four is assigned a new crew member, a parshman who can't bother to give them his name, so they call him shen. kaladin walks around camp to think. he asks syl about odium, and she hisses and zips off without a word. kaladin sees an officer beating a whore in the street and starts to intervene, but he sees a high-ranking officer in blue (adolin) come onto the scene. the officer backs down and adolin offers to escort the lady out of the camp. he flips an emerald chip at kaladin and tells him to pass along a message for him. kaladin takes the chip but doesn't pass along the message. chapter 47: stormblessings[edit] kaladin's enlistment is almost up, but he has already decided to re-up because he can't face his parents for his failure to protect tien. kaladin bribes another squadleader to transfer a new recruit (cenn) to his squad. kaladin wonders why the alethi fight amongst themselves so much when they also join together to fight against real foreign invaders. he walks by the surgeons to hand over another bribe so his men will receive quick aid on the battlefield. a windspren makes the pouch stick to his belt, making him stumble. he tosses it to ven, the chief surgeon. when he gets to his squad, cenn is already there. he looks so much like tien, kaladin has to look away. after scanning the battleground and conferring with dallet, kaladin's squad charges forward at the horn call. kaladin is looking for cenn in the battle and spots him in the middle of the enemy. he rushes to the boy's aid and quickly dispatches six opponents. other members of the squad arrive and surround them while kaladin bandages cenn's wounded leg. kaladin decides to attack a lighteyed officer on a horse, hoping to bring him down and earn a spot on the shattered plains. the officer underestimates his spearmen and is quickly dispatched. toorim spots a shardbearer in golden shardplate with a majestic shardblade. the shardbearer tramples cenn and kills others of the squad on his way to amaram. cenn utters his death rattle and dies. kaladin and the remaining twenty men of his squad charge after the shardbearer while everyone else is running away. they fight ferociously but with little effect. the shardbearer effortlessly cuts them down with sweeps of his blade, killing all but four of the squad. just as he approaches amaram, kaladin attacks again, aiming for the head. his spear is severed by the shardblade, but he catches the spearhead in mid-air and slams it into the eye slit of the armor, killing the shardbearer. he refuses to take the blade because that would make him one of ""them,"" a corrupt lighteyes. he tells coreb that it's his. chapter 48: strawberry[edit] ""they take away the light, wherever they lurk. skin that is burned."" shallan shallan is sketching while in a hospital and on suicide watch. she is growing accustomed to the creatures with the symbolheads who have been lurking in her drawings. she has her safepouch buttoned in her hospital robe. she notes how similar her current situation is to her time back home on her father's estate, having every need seen to but being unable to leave. the suicide attempt will make for an easy excuse to go home, so she can use the trip home to learn how to use the soulcaster. she finishes her picture of the place she went to when she soulcast and figures that the symbolheads must have something to do with soulcasting. king taravangian comes to visit and agrees to let shallan have visitors. jasnah enters and tries to apologize but doesn't do very well because of little practice. jasnah then gifts shallan with the ""book of endless pages"" and explains the metaphor behind it. kabsal enters with a basket of bread and strawberry jam. jasnah seems curious about the jam and smells it, but does not eat any. she does eat bread with the others. kabsal insists that shallan try some of the jam, but to shallan it smells awful, like it's gone bad. even so, kabsal scoops out a big glob and shoves it into his mouth, claiming it tastes good. he suddenly gets up and starts running from the room, but he collapses to the floor. shallan rushes to his side, but she also starts feeling dizzy. jasnah shouts that shallan has been poisoned and that she needs a garnet. thinking that jasnah can't save her with the broken soulcaster, shallan upends her safepouch revealing the stolen one. she feels a flash of heat through her insides before all goes black. chapter 49: to care[edit] ""radiant / of birthplace / the announcer comes / to come announce / the birthplace of radiants."" kaladin and the rest of bridge four are walking through the chasms. kaladin thinks about where the water goes and if it might be possible to escape to the east if his dreams were real. he is pulled out of his thoughts by teft who questions him about his health, whether he feels surges of strength or perhaps light. thinking about it, kaladin notes how fast he healed and wonders if he might be cursed like someone who sought out the old magic. he considers if maybe syl is not the only spren following him, but maybe an evil one as well. they find themselves at a crossroads and kaladin decides to use this spot for their training. he tells the bridgemen that normally in military training, the sergeant will attempt to humble the soldiers at first. but they don't need that because they don't dream of glory; they just want to escape and survive. his first lesson is that a soldier should care, not be cold and emotionless. he drops the spear and tells them that the second lesson is to learn to stand before holding a spear. he tells skar to push him over, and he can't do it, even when others come in to help. he tells teft to pair them off to practice and to oversee the training, and teft responds like a soldier, revealing his past military experience. when he looks at kaladin he can see that kaladin also noticed it. kaladin goes a little apart with rock, who explains why he can't fight. kaladin sends him along with lopen, dabbid, and shen to collect salvage. when rock notes that they can't do the work of a whole bridge crew, kaladin has syl make herself visible to the rest so that she can help them search more quickly. kaladin assures lopen that he will still receive training but that it is more important now to bring up the quota of salvage so as not to be discovered. he rejoins the crew and helps teft. the men learn in hours what should have taken them days to learn. kaladin realizes that the bridgemen have been prepared for training by the physical intensity of their bridge duty. chapter 50: backbreaker powder[edit] ""flame and char. skin so terrible. eyes like pits of blackness."" shallan shallan wakes up in a private hospital room, feeling oddly healthy. a woman sees her awake and rushes out. shallan has some trouble remembering what happened, so when she sees a guard looking in on her she asks what happened to her. though he doesn't answer, she suddenly remembers being poisoned, and also kabsal. asking if he is alright, the guard only turns back, but when she tries to get up he glares at her, causing her to stay in bed. she remembers that she returned the stolen soulcaster to jasnah. half an hour later jasnah comes in and demands to know who ordered her to steal the soulcaster. shallan tells her that she stole it of her own volition to try to save her family from financial ruin. jasnah tells her that kabsal was trying to poison her all along with the bread. the jam contained the antidote so shallan would survive. jasnah tells shallan how disappointed she is in her, and that she now understands that it was the guilt of the theft that drove shallan to attempt suicide. no one will take her in as a ward now; she has thrown away a promising career. jasnah leaves, leaving shallan alone. chapter 51: sas nahn[edit] kaladin is waiting in one of amaram's waiting rooms. only four of his twenty-six men survived -- he had actually begun to believe those who called him lucky. numb, he thinks how he can now be considered among those who have killed a shardbearer like lanacin the surefooted, or evod markmaker, but he just doesn't care. refusing the shards was probably the stupidest thing anyone has ever done, but the thought of taking them revolts him. amaram enters the room along with a stormwarden. they are discussing the identity and motives of the shardbearer. the rest of the squad enters along with some lighteyed officers. amaram asks kaladin why he charged the shardbearer and why he rejected the shards. kaladin doesn't want to reveal his disdain of lighteyes, and becoming one of them, so he replies that he doesn't know why. amaram makes a signal, then his soldiers slaughter the four spearmen while kaladin is held back by guards, shrieking in anger and agony at seeing his men murdered. amaram looks guilty, but he justifies his actions by saying that he is trained in the sword and that kaladin would demand the shards back in a few days anyway. since kaladin saved his life, he will spare his. he will promulgate the story that he (amaram) killed the shardbearer and that kaladin fled the scene, the rest of the squad killed by the shardbearer. the stormwarden brands kaladin a slave. interludes[edit] interlude i-7: baxil[edit] baxil and his cousin av walk down a corridor of the palace of ashno of sages. their mistress walks ahead and stops at an intersection. she asks for his bag of tools, and she proceeds into the hallowed hall where she begins to destroy works of art--slashing paintings with a knife and pounding on sculptures with a mallet. as she works, baxil and av talk about going to the nightwatcher. baxil claims he can avoid the curse by phrasing his request just right, but av says it doesn't matter what your boon is, you get a curse no matter what. baxil wishes he could get some courage using the old magic. interlude i-8: geranid[edit] geranid geranid and ashir are two ardents in the twilight of life devoted to each other and their research. geranid studies spren; ashir uses cooking to experiment with chemistry. he wonders if he should change his calling because food may not be needed in the cognitive and spiritual realms. geranid measures a flamespren and notes that it stays locked in its current state once it is measured. ashir tells geranid to go into the other room. he will call out three numbers, one the true measurement, and she is to only write down one. when he calls out the actual measurement, the spren locks in place. it seems to know when it is being measured. interlude i-9: death wears white[edit] szeth szeth kills two guards and crashes through a door, entering the king's banquet, and starts to kill. king hanavanar of jah keved yells for help. szeth slaughters many of the people trying to flee and makes his way over to the king. two shardbearers come out from hiding and another squad wearing half-shards enter the room to attack. szeth drops his sword and uses his windrunner abilities to fling the attackers about the room. he infuses a stone multiple times and lashes it toward one of the shardbearers, crushing him to death. he kills the rest of the honor guard easily and slams himself down on the king, pinning him to the floor. he puts his shardblade through his face. part four: storm's illumination[edit] chapter 52: a highway to the sun[edit] ""i'm standing over the body of a brother. i'm weeping. is that his blood or mine? what have we done?"" adolin dalinar discusses his decision to abdicate with adolin, who is not ready to become highprince. a highstorm approaches, and adolin and renarin tie dalinar down in preparation for the coming vision. dalinar dalinar enters the vision as a guard atop feverstone keep. casting about for the reason he's been sent to this time and place, he is the first to notice an approaching army. the army is identified as radiants, specifically the orders of the stoneward and windrunners. dalinar senses that something is wrong, and runs out the keep's gate to approach the radiants. he is not far away when the first one sticks his shardblade into the ground, and then shucks all the pieces of his shardplate, turns around, and walks away without a word. the other two-hundred or so radiants do the same. dalinar feels a tremendous sense of loss and tragedy at their abandonment, and tries to get one of them to tell him why they are doing this. one of them stops beside him, and in the voice of the one who has addressed dalinar in previous visions, tells him, ""they were the first, and they were also the last."" dalinar identifies the event he's just witnessed as the day of recreance. returning to himself, dalinar and adolin resume their discussion. adolin wishes for dalinar to simply recognize that the visions aren't true, ignore them, and continue leading the princedom. dalinar refuses, saying that if he is to lead, he must trust his conscience and judgement, and therefore, the visions. otherwise, he would second-guess himself at every decision and lead the house to ruin. renarin interjects with a suggestion that it may be possible to verify whether dalinar's visions are true or not. dalinar asks navani to scribe it for him, and then communicate with jasnah to ask her if she can prove or disprove any of the details. chapter 53: dunny[edit] ""he must pick it up, the fallen title! the tower, the crown, and the spear!"" dunny is trampled on a bridge run, and kaladin blames himself for not being able to save him. to cope with dunny's loss, kaladin decides to save the wounded bridgemen from other bridges. the bridgemen hesitate at first because helping other bridges drains their resources. kaladin lectures them on honor and the hypocritical lighteyes, and they start helping him, ashamed. while working, teft reminds kaladin to keep his pouch of spheres infused and on his person at all times, and comments on the good luck bridge four had, sustaining zero casualties during all their approaches. four of the wounded bridgemen survive. chapter 54: gibletish[edit] ""the burdens of nine become mine. why must i carry the madness of them all? oh, almighty, release me."" dalinar elhokar hosts a feast, which dalinar attends. wit sits next to dalinar, and tips him off that sadeas intends to reveal something at the feast. he tells dalinar he has to leave, and disappears. dalinar gathers adolin and his guards about him, just in case, then goes to confront sadeas and see what the announcement is. sadeas announces to all present that the strap was definitely cut, but that it happened while the horse was in the king's palace complex. he says that dalinar is an ""unlikely suspect."" after the announcement, sadeas and dalinar discuss their estranged friendship and the war. dalinar admits to having called for retreat, but says that he now favors finding a tactic to win the war once and for all instead. he proposes an alliance with sadeas, sketches out some preliminary ideas for how they could complement each other, and sadeas agrees. chapter 55: an emerald broam[edit] ""a woman sits and scratches out her own eyes. daughter of kings and winds, the vandal."" kaladin witnesses the first joint plateau assault of sadeas and dalinar. the fight goes so quickly and so well that bridge four is sent down into the chasms right after returning from the run. they find a dead lighteyed officer who has an emerald broam (worth two hundred days of a bridgeman's pay), in addition to a pouch of lesser spheres. kaladin hatches a plan to sneak the pouch out of the chasms without surrendering it, but it hinges on the ability of someone to tie the pouch to an arrow, and then shoot the arrow at the underside of a permanent bridge so it can be picked up later. as nobody else has the necessary proficiency with a bow, rock finally admits that he can make the shot and nails it perfectly, all the while insisting that he may shoot bridges with it, but that he will never use a bow in battle. chapter 56: that storming book[edit] ""light grows so distant. the storm never stops. i am broken, and all around me have died. i weep for the end of all things. he has won. oh, he has beaten us."" dalinar dalinar and sadeas attack another plateau together. just as it appears that they have won, a second parshendi army appears in direct response to the new alethi strategy of combined assaults. dalinar lays out a new strategy for the army to follow to adjust for the new threat, but then sees that sadeas is right in the thick of where the parshendi have come. dalinar mounts gallant and the two of them bound across the chasm, leaving a line of death in their wake as they make their way towards sadeas. when they arrive, dalinar finds that his old friend has fallen and is being beaten down by a horde of parshendi. dalinar kills them all and defends sadeas single-handedly until adolin and his guard are able to penetrate the parshendi line and relieve the highprinces. sadeas asks why dalinar would take such a risk for him, to which dalinar repeats principles that have been instilled in him by the way of kings. sadeas is displeased that it holds such sway over dalinar, calling it ""that storming book."" he warns dalinar that those ideals will get him killed one day. chapter 57: wandersail[edit] ""i hold the suckling child in my hands, a knife at his throat, and know that all who live wish me to let the blade slip. spill its blood upon the ground, over my hands, and with it gain us further breath to draw."" maps dies of an arrow wound in the chest, and kaladin agonizes over the loss, as he always does. after the bridge run, kaladin insists on treating teft's wounded arm. teft prods kaladin to see if he has had any ""odd experiences"" lately. when kaladin tells him he's noticed nothing, teft moves to punch kaladin. reacting instinctively, kaladin breathes in all the stormlight in the spheres he's carrying in preparation for self-defense. teft points out that all the spheres are now dun, and lopen notices that kaladin's medical pack is sticking to the side of a barrel. panicking at finally noticing his powers, kaladin runs off to try to get rid of the stormlight and figure out what's wrong with him. syl admits that she's not a windspren. she doesn't remember much, but she knows that she binds things. she says that kaladin is changing because of her, that she takes something from him, and gives something in return. kaladin wanders off to be alone as evening falls. he finds hoid playing a flute. he tells him the story of derethil and the wandersail. at hoid's prompting, kaladin concludes that the moral of the story is taking responsibility. he decides that he must take responsibility and do whatever he can to save bridge four, even if that means embracing strange and frightening powers. hoid gives him a flute and tells him to take care of sigzil. kaladin returns to the group and asks teft how he knew what he is. teft says that when he was a youth, his family belonged to a secret sect that awaited the return of the knights radiant. he asks teft how much he knows of his powers, and kaladin decides to try to find out more. chapter 58: the journey[edit] ""re-sephir, the midnight mother, giving birth to abominations with her essence so dark, so terrible, so consuming. she is here! she watches me die!"" adolin adolin is drinking at a wineshop in the outer market, accompanied by his date danlan, and fellow lighteyes jakamav, inkima, toral and eshava. they debate why sadeas has not moved against dalinar and whether dalinar should step down due to his visions and unpopular restrictions on the army. adolin leaves to prepare for a duel with brightlord resi. while walking through the market, he ponders what his father is doing. he notices that officers from other armies look less disciplined and more casual about the war. he begins to agree with what his father is doing. dalinar dalinar recites a passage from the way of kings about nohadon's journey to urithiru to sadeas and elhokar as they watch some lesser lighteyes duel while they wait for adolin's bout to begin. sadeas dismisses the story as boring and sentimental and insults dalinar, though dalinar doesn't get angry. elhokar jokes that sadeas could be the new wit, since hoid vanished as he does periodically. as adolin and resi duel, dalinar states that if he were in charge, he would withdraw the army to alethkar to stabilize their homeland and send envoys to the parshendi to investigate gavilar's murder. elhokar praises dalinar's explanation and speaks of plots against him and inhuman faces that he sees in mirrors. dalinar thinks that he is paranoid. elhokar gets dalinar to agree to a joint assault with sadeas where both army's bridge crews are used, as an experiment. adolin wins his duel easily. sadeas asks for a clerk to be sent to him with a copy of the way of kings. chapter 59: an honor[edit] ""above the final void i hang, friends behind, friends before. the feast i must drink clings to their faces, and the words i must speak spark in my mind. the old oaths will be spoken anew."" kaladin and teft are in the bridge four barracks while rock runs drills outside and lopen stands watch at the entrance. kaladin tries to draw light from an infused sphere but fails, and wonders if he really is a surgebinder and potential knight radiant as teft insists he is. teft lectures kaladin on the first oath and speaks of the way of kings which his mother had read, and which the radiants based their ideals on. brightness hashal appears, stating that bridge four would be on full-time bridge run duty during the day, and chasm duty at night, and that they should feel honored by this, though kaladin realizes it is a death sentence for his men. after hashal leaves, kaladin and the others debate their options, and kaladin accidentally breathes in stormlight and starts glowing faintly. kaladin gathers his crew in the chasm for their shift and they start spear practice. they still need weeks of practice to be able to escape. teft leads the drill as kaladin and syl investigate some parshendi corpses. kaladin cuts off some parshendi carapace and has lopen gather some parshendi bones. he puts them all in a sack. they proceed to a shallow chasm where lopen had dropped some rope on a prior bridge run. kaladin whispers the first ideal of the knights radiant and breathes in stormlight from his pouch of spheres, then uses it to create a makeshift ladder of stones to climb up the chasm wall and tie the sack to the bottom of a bridge for later retrieval. syl tells him to just cut the rope he's hanging from, ensuring him that he'll be alright. he cuts the rope and falls forty feet to the ground. he lands on his feet and uses his remaining stormlight to immediately heal his injuries. he tells lopen to retrieve the sack during their next bridge run. chapter 60: that which we cannot have[edit] ""the death is my life, the strength becomes my weakness, the journey has ended."" dalinar dalinar has decided not to abdicate to adolin. the two wait for the coming highstorm in dalinar's chambers with renarin and navani. navani has a new fabrial, an early model of a painrial, which she shows the three by using it on an ache in adolin's hand. despite all the discoveries the engineers have made with fabrials, they are no closer to making new shardblades and shardplate. dalinar speculates that they were provided by the heralds themselves, then the highstorm hits, and he enters another vision. he talks with a man with a regal bearing, who dalinar later realizes must be a younger nohadon, writer of the way of kings. a desolation has just ended, and 90% of the people nohadon ruled are dead. some of those still alive try to cast blame on the surgebinder alakavish, who began a war just before the desolation started. nohadon contemplates giving up his throne if he cannot actually do any good with his leadership. dalinar, who nohadon believes is his advisor karm, tells him to write a book about his philosophy on leadership and how people should live. nohadon scoffs at the idea and says that action and the sword are what is needed. he would like peace, but ""to be human is to want that which we cannot have."" he walks off. just before the end of the vision, dalinar repeats nohadon's statement. he comes back to the present time and believes he did little about discovering any facts about proving his visions true or false. navani cuts him off, asking him to repeat the last thing he said. she then tells him she believes he has been speaking in the dawnchant, a dead language, and the phrase he just gave her may be the key needed to translate the language. she tells dalinar and his sons that this is the proof they were looking for and that the visions are real. chapter 61: right for wrong[edit] ""in the storm i awaken, falling, spinning, grieving."" dalinar some hours after his last vision, dalinar sits with navani and renarin. adolin has gone for the highstorm damage report, appearing shaken that the visions are real. navani asks dalinar why he thinks the man in his vision was nohadon. dalinar can't give evidence but he's sure that it was him. prodded on her knowledge about the desolations, navani tells what she knows but insists that jasnah is the historian. they continue to debate, thinking about the old magic but discard that option. dalinar is also disturbed that the visions are real, and he asks to be alone. renarin leaves immediately, but navani lingers. she tells dalinar why she really came back to the shattered plains. she felt useless, expected to fade to the background and not be involved. she closes the door and they kiss passionately. afterwards she tells him that something is wrong on roshar, something bigger than the war of reckoning they are fighting. she shares her knowledge about the assassination of the king of jah keved by a shin shardbearer wearing white. chapter 62: three glyphs[edit] ""the darkness becomes a palace. let it rule! let it rule!"" kaladin and bridge four are on another bridgerun. he's nervous because this time he wants to try distracting the parshendi archers with his self-made parshendi armor and shield. on the way to the battlefield a soldier who doesn't want to wait for the army's water crews tries to force his way to bridge four's water skin. because kaladin's armor is hidden with the water bridge four persuades the soldier to back down. on the final approach kaladin manages to draw the full attention of the parshendi archers by wearing parshendi armor and shield. he uses stormlight to improve his speed, heal his wounds, and draw arrows to his shield. sadeas rides up and is forced to promote matal because ""his"" idea of distracting the parshendi worked. kaladin himself suffers from shock after using so much stormlight. as always, the members of bridge four look for wounded from other bridge crews and care for them. suddenly lopen calls out, as he spots a group of parshendi archers coming back to the chasm and aiming at bridge four. while the men try to escape out of range they are surprised to see dalinar dashing into the parshendi force and striking them down. when done, dalinar raises his blade in a salute at bridge four. chapter 63: fear[edit] ""i wish to sleep. i know now why you do what you do, and i hate you for it. i will not speak of the truths i see."" kaladin tells leyten to make carapace armor for every member of bridge four except for shen. kaladin observes spear practice and notices that moash is very skilled. he asks about his purpose, and moash replies that he wants vengeance, but declines to say on whom. kaladin and rock discuss their plans to escape. teft asks kaladin to teach the bridgemen but he declines, saying that he would become too eager and impatient, and kaladin admits that he failed in the past and that it got to him. chapter 64: a man of extremes[edit] ""they come from the pit, two dead men, a heart in their hands, and i know that i have seen true glory."" dalinar dalinar and navani continue to see each other in secret. dalinar tells navani that he was interested in courting her, but he instead deferred to gavilar when his brother also showed interest in her. that was the nature of the siblings' relationship. navani thought that dalinar hated her because he was cold towards her for the last two decades, out of trying to conceal his true feelings. navani says that dalinar and his wife were a perfect match in temperament. dalinar also reveals that he keeps a tight rein on himself to avoid reverting to his past tyrannical self. their conversation is interrupted as alarms sound indicating a chasmfiend is located at the tower plateau, where dalinar wants to run a dual assault with sadeas. kaladin bridge four lines up for the assault. they all wear carapace armor, expertly crafted and ornamented by leyten. every man also has a shield crafted from parshendi bones, some ornamented with smaller bones to create a rattling sound. the other bridgemen look on in astonishment and admiration and cheer bridge four as they raise their bridge to shoulders. adolin adolin was shocked to learn he was wrong about his father, but he's glad that he was. now he could trust him fully. dalinar, adolin, and sadeas confer at the staging area, and decide to bring fifteen thousand troops, as many as they can muster, to try to finish off the parshendi army in one fell swoop. chapter 65: the tower[edit] ""i see them. they are the rocks. they are the vengeful spirits. eyes of red."" dalinar dalinar and sadeas watch as the parshendi army of roughly ten thousand lines up, while they still try to remove the gemheart. sadeas suggests they attack together, but dalinar knows that many of the bridgemen will be killed. he holds to the code and won't order what he himself wouldn't do. dalinar will follow sadeas's army once a bridgehead is cleared. kaladin kaladin leads four other decoys in drawing parshendi arrows away from the bridge crews, though he draws the most missiles by far, until all the surviving bridges are in place and the army rushes across. kaladin then goes to help teft and skar, who were hit by arrows, and starts operating on teft, as there are enough soldiers in the area to protect them. dalinar dalinar orders a crew to set a bridge for his army to cross, and he leads his men into battle along with adolin. some parshendi target him with large rocks, but he goes after them and takes care of them easily. after some time in the battle, dalinar feels the thrill, but loses it as he faces down a youthful parshendi. he starts having doubts about fighting, and thinks about the codes and gavilar's murder and the visions, trying to decide what is the right course of action. adolin interrupts his reverie to point out that another group of parshendi have arrived. dalinar wonders why sadeas's scouts didn't give them warning. he climbs to the top of the rock formation to see that sadeas, with his army and bridge crews, have fled from the tower plateau, leaving his own army surrounded and cut off from retreat. chapter 66: codes[edit] ""that chanting, that singing, those rasping voices."" kaladin kaladin finishes working on skar, saying that he will be able to walk normally once he heals up. kaladin then notices that sadeas is retreating even though the battle seems to be going well, and realizes that the highprince is betraying dalinar. kaladin sees that sadeas is unharmed, and hears him say that dalinar's honor would someday get him killed. dalinar adolin yells at dalinar that he knew that sadeas's betrayal was inevitable, as they fight off waves of parshendi, and dalinar agrees in resignation. adolin refuses to blame his father though, saying that his honor would not make him behave differently, which surprises dalinar. dalinar tries to motivate his soldiers with a speech, saying that they will all die with glory and honor intact. dalinar silently regrets that he will leave renarin alone to inherit, surrounded by enemies, and says good bye. chapter 67: words[edit] ""let me no longer hurt! let me no longer weep! dai-gonarthis! the black fisher holds my sorrow and consumes it!"" kaladin as sadeas's forces withdraw, bridge four lags behind. having wounded and already being low in number, they are unable to move ahead of the army and help with the crossing of the staging plateau. instead of crossing with the army, kaladin tells matal that they will rest, use their bridge to follow and catch up later. kaladin gives the pretense that he doesn't want to slow the rest of the army. the army continues westward without bridge four. kaladin explains to the men that now they can simply escape without fighting. everything is perfect except the wounded back at camp. kaladin insists that he stay with the wounded and escape later. kaladin feels unsettled, and not just because of the men he would have to leave behind. he sees syl next to him as a regular-sized woman. she stands looking back at the battle with an expression of horror. kaladin also looks back at the battle. he sees the thousands of dark eyed soldiers hopelessly surrounded. syl says that she now remembers what kind of spren she is. she is an honorspren. the spirit of oaths, promises, and nobility. kaladin thinks that trying to save kholin's army would be suicide and that he and his men owe dalinar nothing. he is determined not to be fooled again like the time he saved amaram. finally he remembers his father's words: ""the lighteyes don't care about life, so i must. so we must."" with the ideals of the radiants forming in his mind he tells the members of bridge four that they must go back. they agree and lift their bridge, heading back to the tower. dalinar dalinar's shardplate grows weak. it is losing stormlight from many small cracks, lending dalinar less strength. dalinar continues to fight, with adolin at the front line of his army, when he sees a lone bridge crew moving towards the chasm. unsure of their purpose he shows adolin who thinks it must be some kind of trap. still unsure, they grab onto this small hope and prepare their men to push towards the bridge crew. kaladin the parshendi have seen the approach of bridge four and prepare to loose arrows. dalinar has seen too and is trying to make his way there in order to escape. kaladin barely dodges the arrows, then syl points to a new contingent of archers, aiming at the unprotected bridgemen. kaladin yells the command for side carry right and expends a huge amount of stormlight, attracting all the arrows to his shield. the parshendi say ""neshua kadal!"" and flee at the display of power. kaladin is completely drained from the excessive use of stormlight. the men set down the bridge and prepare to fight another group of parshendi who heavily outnumber the bridgemen. kaladin can only lay on the ground in despair, having failed to protect again, just like the day that tien died. kaladin (flashback) kaladin's squad is all dead, and he is commanded to go back to the reserves for reassignment. he tries to find tien's squad and gets caught up in the chaos of battle. after a brief exchange with an enemy soldier, he is conscripted into a new squad. kaladin sees three messenger boys placed in the front of the battle as a distraction. he rushes over to help defend tien but is too late. kaladin (back in the present) syl prods kaladin to say the words. he forces himself to his feet and grabs a spear. he runs into the battle and notices that the bearded parshendi have infused gems woven into their beads. he breathes in stormlight and regains his strength and heals his wounds. a voice in his head urges again: ""the words."" although he never learned them, he knows them, and whispers ""i will protect those who cannot protect themselves."" teft kaladin explodes with energy and light. the bridgemen watch in wonder as kaladin furiously fights. chapter 68: eshonai[edit] ""they named it the final desolation, but they lied. our gods lied. oh, how they lied. the everstorm comes. i hear its whispers, see its stormwall, know its heart."" adolin adolin cuts through the parshendi lines leading the remaining kholin forces down the slope of the 'tower' towards the bridge at the western side of the plateau. the maneuver is reckless but his troops are well trained and they make their mad dash for freedom. teft meanwhile, teft, along with the other members of bridge four, are transfixed watching kaladin engage the parshendi. he moves with inhuman speed and precision. he also moves with a glow that teft knows is stormlight. members of the crew momentarily gawk at kaladin's unnatural skill. but teft quickly commands them into a defensive formation intended to support kaladin and to hold the bridge's position on the plateau. dalinar dalinar fights, making his way to the bridgemen he had seen return to the plateau. now unable to see them, he thinks that they have certainly died by now. but he thanks them for giving him and his men purpose as they fight to their doom. but as he approaches the chasm he finds that the bridgemen are indeed holding their ground. he orders adolin forward to support the bridgemen and he turns his attention towards maintaining the corridor that is allowing his men to escape. however, a seven-foot-tall parshendi in shardplate steps forward. dalinar is surprised by the shardbearer's late arrival but concludes that he is there to prevent dalinar's retreat which was now possible. dalinar quickly finds himself at a disadvantage due to the damage to his shardplate already sustained but is able to lure the shardbearer up on a rock formation where he cuts the rock out from under his attacker. this topples the shardbearer onto the ground. he cuts free another piece of rock onto the shardbearer, but the damage to his own shardplate slows dalinar too much to take advantage of shardearer's position. unable to flee, dalinar continues to fight. kaladin kaladin and bridge four fight to hold their bridgehead for what seems like hours to kaladin. during this time kaladin finds himself gaining respect for the parshendi's battlefield ethics. he seems to find in the parshendi what he had hoped to find in the warcamps of alethi. the kholin army finally breaks through the parshendi lines and takes control of the bridge, defending both sides of the chasm. kaladin stops to take a report from his men only to find that malop, earless jaks, and narm are dead. he orders his men back across the bridge to the staging chasm. with moash, kaladin looks to the lead of the retreat. unable to find a suitable officer, kaladin promotes a very young lighteyed soldier and gets him to organize the retreat. he then finds an officer of the cobalt guard and asks why they aren't crossing; they are sworn to protect adolin, so they refuse to go. so kaladin finds adolin and commands him to cross the bridge. he doesn't want to abandon his father, so kaladin promises to help him while they retreat. the cobalt guard follows kaladin but can't keep up. dalinar dalinar takes multiple hits to his helm, which finally explodes, leaving him dazed and confused. his parshendi enemy doesn't finish him off, though, instead leaning down to him and saying, ""it is you. i have found you at last."" there is a disturbance in the parshendi ranks, and dalinar sees a glowing spearman approaching. kaladin kaladin finds a hole in the armor of the parshendi looming over dalinar and strikes, using stormlight-enhanced strength. the surrounding parshendi start chanting ""neshua kadal"" and fearfully back away, not attacking. he finds gallant and brings him over to dalinar. dalinar dalinar gets up and wants to finish off the shardbearer, but kaladin calls upon his honor to retreat immediately since no one will leave without him. he agrees and calls the retreat, galloping toward the bridge with kaladin and the cobalt guard following. they go across and the parshendi do not give chase. the parshendi shardbearer salutes dalinar. he finds kaladin and vows to protect him from sadeas if he will join his army. kaladin agrees since they can't very well escape now with so many wounded and little supplies. chapter 69: justice[edit] ""all is withdrawn for me. i stand against the one who saved my life. i protect the one who killed my promises. i raise my hand. the storm responds."" navani at sadeas's staging area navani forces her way through the crowd after hearing rumors that sadeas came back from battle without dalinar. renarin follows her. sadeas tells navani that the parshendi overwhelmed dalinar's forces, forcing him to retreat to save his own men. he claims to have witnessed dalinar fall to parshendi hammers. unwilling to believe sadeas's account, navani creates an enormous thath glyph across the staging area stone ground in burn ink. navani releases her prayer for justice by lighting glyph, which leaves a scorch mark on the stone. shortly after the flames die, one of sadeas's message runner approaches with news of dalinar's survival. dalinar dalinar rides at the head of his remaining force. seething with anger, he contemplates his confrontation with sadeas. he knows he must first protect alethkar despite his desire for revenge. as his force approaches the warcamp, dalinar dismisses his wounded to his camp and offers to send kaladin's bridgemen with them, but they are determined to see his promise to buy their freedom through. unwilling to force them to go, dalinar allows them to accompany him into sadeas's warcamp. he unexpectedly finds renarin and navani in sadeas's warcamp. he embraces his son and later navani. he tells navani that he sees the world differently now and is now unwilling to let 'lying men' control his life. releasing navani, he confronts sadeas. publicly they feign civility. sadeas apologizes for overestimating the threat against dalinar's forces and retreating too soon. but, standing close so as not to be overheard, dalinar privately asks sadeas why. sadeas responds referring to his oath to protect elhokar, saying that dalinar is going insane and becoming weak. he feels that these ideas are infecting elhokar. and, in the end, he just wanted dalinar gone. in this admission of guilt, dalinar realizes that acting honorably would never win sadeas's loyalty. kaladin kaladin watches the conference between dalinar and sadeas with the members of bridge four. the private conversation ends, and sadeas states aloud that their alliance was ""unfeasible."" dalinar claims the bridgemen, but sadeas refuses to let them go. he offers sixty emerald broams for each member. but sadeas is unwilling to sell, stating that he would not sell them for 1,000 broams and tells dalinar to leave his camp. kaladin turns away, thinking dalinar would not be able to fulfill his promise when there are gasps of surprise. kaladin turns to see that dalinar had summoned his shardblade. dalinar offers his shardblade for all of sadeas's bridgemen. sadeas accepts and mocks him for giving up his shardblade for worthless slaves. unable to believe what has just happened, kaladin asks dalinar why. dalinar explains that kaladin saved him and two thousand of his men. all of whose lives are priceless. in his opinion, one priceless sword is a small price to pay for two thousand lives, especially to keep his honor. dalinar dalinar finds elhokar in the sitting room of the palace wearing his shardplate. dalinar initiates a quick brawl in which he kicks elhokar several times, cracking his shardplate and repeatedly keeping him from summoning his blade. dalinar ends the ""fight"" by breaking elhokar's breastplate, subduing him. he then demands to know if elhokar himself cut the girth on his own saddle to get dalinar to take him more seriously. reluctantly, elhokar admits to cutting the girth. an exasperated dalinar then explains the consequences of this -- including sadeas's betrayal. additionally, dalinar demonstrates how easily he could kill elhokar, stating that he could have done it a hundred times over and that he is not elhokar's enemy. releasing his nephew, he tells elhokar that tomorrow he will appoint dalinar as highprince of war. determined to finally see the war won and alethkar united, he decides to stop trying to be nohadon the peacemaker and return to being the blackthorn, the warlord. elhokar is reluctant, fearing rebellion from the various highprinces, but dalinar turns to leave, confident that he will make the appointment and content knowing the challenges that are before him. just before exiting, he also informs elhokar about the courtship between himself and navani. part five: the silence above[edit] chapter 70: sea of glass[edit] shallan lay in her hospital bed lamenting her actions and, to her surprise, kabsal's death. but as she recalls the events leading up to her poisoning, things do not completely add up. she wonders why the antidote did not work for kabsal and why jasnah was not poisoned since she too had eaten the poisoned bread. she finds her sketchpad and draws an imperfect drawing of jasnah examining the strawberry jam, remembering that she was not repulsed by the smell. then she draws jasnah eating the bread. in her drawing, it looks like it is melting. realizing something, she leaves the hospital and walks in the darkness to the conclave wearing only her hospital robe. she tells jasnah that she knows that jasnah uses a fake soulcaster. showing her the picture shallan had drawn of shadesmar to a shocked jasnah, she concludes that jasnah never had a working soulcaster. jasnah disregards shallan's statements as fatigue induced delusions. to prove her statements shallan attempts to return to shadesmar. holding her partially dun garnet sphere, she speaks with the twisted symbol-headed spren. they request a truth, preferably a secret truth, to form a bond. to form the bond, shallan admits to killing her father. she falls into the sea of beads. she begins to drown but is rescued by jasnah who reprimands her for going to shadesmar with only a single dim sphere. shallan asks to be part of jasnah's work in truth and be trained in soulcasting. at first jasnah objects, but shallan apologizes and explains that she could be someone that can share jasnah's secrets. jasnah relents and makes shallan promise never to lie or steal again and gives shallan her notes on the voidbringers. chapter 71: recorded in blood[edit] szeth, working as a porter, walks the streets of kharbranth towards the king's palace. having assassinated the other names on the list given him by his unseen master, he is in kharbranth to finish his work and kill king taravangian. using his shardblade, he cuts a hole in the servants privy to access the king's portion of the palace. szeth easily subdues taravangian's guards and enters the king's study. following his instructions, szeth informs the king that he has killed the others and is there to finish the job. but the king reveals himself to be szeth's unknown master. he put his name on the list to deflect suspicion should szeth fail. the king claims the assassinations are necessary to build a stronger roshar for the coming years. szeth accuses the king of using him to do his dirty work and, as a response, the king takes him to his secret hospital. the hospital is filled with dying people who are having their blood slowly drained. here the king shows szeth that his hands are not clean, having drained the blood of many. he explains that the dying see something important as they die, and here they record their words. he believes their words may contain the key to everyone's salvation. he then adds a name to szeth's list that he had hoped to avoid but recent events had made necessary: dalinar kholin. chapter 72: veristitalian[edit] before reading jasnah's notes on the voidbringers, shallan asks jasnah how she soulcasted her blood multiple times if she was so unskilled in organic material. jasnah replies that blood is one of the essences and is therefore easy to soulcast, unlike the strawberry jam which she had never seen before. shallan has a great many additional questions about soulcasting, but jasnah returns the conversation back to the voidbringers. shallan asks how jasnah could believe in these myths when so many trusted scholars considered the voidbringers a fabrication. jasnah replies that she in general seeks to find natural meanings to supernatural events. she believes that something real caused the legends of the voidbringers. reading from her notes, jasnah helps shallan see that the humans on roshar did not destroy or banish the voidbringers. they instead enslaved them as the parshmen. chapter 73: trust[edit] kaladin waits at dalinar's warcamp's staging ground as requested by dalinar himself. as he waits he wonders with syl whether he can trust dalinar. syl seems to feel that dalinar is indeed honorable. kaladin feels conflicted about his actions that day. he wonders again whether he could truly protect by killing and whether the three lives lost from his bridge crew were worth the thousands of soldiers and lighteyes that they saved. as the middle moon finishes rising, dalinar joins kaladin on the staging ground. they discuss the condition of the bridge crews and how many kaladin thinks will stay in the army. dalinar wants kaladin and bridge four to replace his honor guard who had been nearly wiped out earlier that day. he wants the rest of the bridgemen to be trained as a company of spearmen. kaladin agrees on condition that the men agree and dalinar makes him a captain. dalinar also gives kaladin his cloak that he wore in battle that day as a token of appreciation. kaladin returns to bridge four's barrack to find his men engaged in their nightly tradition of eating rock's stew. they talk to him about his extraordinary abilities and they want him to teach them how to do it too. kaladin is unsure if it's teachable but agrees to try. they decide to create experiments to test his abilities, and kaladin demands an oath of silence about his abilities. he then relaxes knowing that he has finally succeeded in saving someone. chapter 74: ghostblood[edit] shallan finishes reading jasnah's notes concerning the voidbringers and comes to the same conclusion as jasnah, that the parshmen are the voidbringers. they discuss the frightening ramifications of this conclusion, and they make plans to travel to the shattered plains to continue investigating king gavilar's death and the parshendi transformation into warriors. they also discuss the ghostbloods, a secret organization seeking answers about the voidbringers. jasnah names kabsal a member of the ghostbloods and after seeing their secret symbol, shallan realizes that her father was also likely a member. chapter 75: in the top room[edit] during the next highstorm after sadeas's betrayal, in one of dalinar's visions, he finds himself in a white rocky landscape with smokey figures rising around him. the voice again tells dalinar to ""... unite them."" dalinar then demands to know why the voice lied to him with regards to trusting sadeas. but instead of answering, the voice appears in human form and continues exhorting dalinar to prepare for the everstorm, showing him a wall of darkness approaching a ruined kholinar. dalinar continues to ask questions and demand answers but soon realizes that the voice cannot hear him and never could. the voice continues telling dalinar that this vision is a glimpse into the future born of his fears. dalinar then sees that the wall of darkness is a wall of dust and as it passes by, the ground falls away leaving the land and where kholinar was an empty void. only the space where dalinar stands remains. the voice tells dalinar that someone must lead, unite and protect the people. he then commands dalinar to rebuild the knights radiant, explaining that unity will be key in facing the true desolation. the voice then ends by proclaiming that he was god (the almighty) and that he is now dead after being killed by odium. epilogue: of most worth[edit] wit has a conversation with some guardsmen in kholinar. he asks them ""what is the talent that men value most?"" one of the guardsmen suggests art, to which wit replies in the negative. at this point, taln stumbles into the main courtyard, bearing a prophecy about the everstorm, before collapsing on the ground, his honorblade beside him. hoid finishes by saying it is timeliness that men value most, and that taln has arrived 'too late'. endnote[edit] ""above silence, the illuminating storms--dying storms--illuminate the silence above."" the endnote is about thoughts from joshor, head of his majesty's silent gatherers, on a ketek told by a dying herdazian who barely spoke the alethi language, and unlikely had the education that he had heard of such a ketek before. they decided to leave this death quote to taravangian to solve the puzzle that it tells. ars arcanum[edit] see ars arcanum#the_stormlight_archive. notes[edit]"
Arts and Majesty,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Arts_and_Majesty,"arts and majesty is an ancient work of rosharan literature that has come to define the vorin ideas of masculine and feminine arts. it defines certain topics and practices as feminine or masculine; the feminine arts are generally those that can be practiced with a single hand, while the masculine arts involve both hands, associating delicacy with women and brute force with men. the idea of the safehand comes from this distinction between one-handed and two-handed arts. history[edit] ""“a woman wanting to come to the battlefield was like … well, like a man wanting to read. unnatural. ”-dalinar"" arts and majesty was written by a female artist well before the day of recreance. it may not have had much influence on culture before the recreance; soon afterward, however, some men in power came across it and began emphasizing it to justify keeping shardblades and shardplate away from women. as retaliation, a movement of women ensured that writing and literacy moved fully into the domain of women. hoid jokingly observed that the female author of the treatise made sure to categorize ""fun"" activities as feminine, while leaving more dangerous activities to the men. the division between masculine and feminine arts became part of vorin culture over the next few decades and remained solidly in place thousands of years later, with the safehand and the femininity of writing being especially prominent in day-to-day life. arts and majesty itself also stayed well-known despite its age, at least among upper-class lighteyes. the division in duties was among the reasons that the alethi set up large warcamps on the shattered plains where families could live, as women were in charge of various essential household functions. in modern vorin culture, practices that were explicitly mentioned in arts and majesty could be considered ""prime"" or ""major"" arts. the gender division of these arts was strictly adhered to, and even simple interest in an art of the opposite gender was thought of as ""unnatural"". in some cases, the distinction between the arts moved beyond a mere cultural norm and gained religious overtones; men who could write, for example, could actually be seen as blasphemous and not just strange. ardents were considered genderless and could technically pursue the arts of either gender. however, cultural norms still influenced ardents; for example, it was rare for a female ardent to practice swordsmanship. practices that were not categorized by arts and majesty could generally be performed by anyone. arts that combine a masculine and feminine discipline-such as carving, which has elements of both carpentry and art-could be practiced by men, women, or a team of both depending on their personal faith and interpretation of the doctrine. if a new art was developed, church leaders and traditionalists would likely have discussions about how to categorize it. the re-emergence of female knights radiant who capably wield shardblades has challenged vorin notions of female propriety. some lighteyes have proved that they can quickly adapt to the notion of a female military commander. arts[edit] feminine[edit] - reading and writing - painting and drawing - science - (e.g., zoology, botany, and natural history) - logic - playing musical instruments masculine[edit] - combat - (facetiously, ""hitting things"", according to - ) - tactics - politics - carpentry - commerce unspecified/neutral[edit] - horseback riding and the care of horses - knitting - singing trivia[edit] - the idea of the safehand and the division between one-handed and two-handed arts arose from - fascination with different taboos across real-life cultures. - brandon acknowledges that it is relatively easy to find examples wherein maintaining the one-handed limitation of the feminine arts would be illogical for everyday life; however, he notes that real-life cultural norms can also be impractical. - lego building would probably be considered a feminine art; since it is difficult to do one-handed, though it might end up being mostly done with two hands behind the scenes anyway. notes[edit]"
Jokasha Monastery,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Jokasha_Monastery,"jokasha monastery, sometimes referred to simply as jokasha, is the home of the devotary of the mind, a scholarly group of ardents on roshar. it is considered a peaceful and desirable location, with many ardents spending half their lives trying to get transferred there. location[edit] the monastery is in jah keved, on the western slopes of the horneater peaks. it lies in a forest and has protection from the violence of the highstorms. the relatively weak storms make the area lush, but humid. structure[edit] the jokasha monastery is made up of a lower building and a higher building connected by a tree-lined pathway. the buildings are adjacent to the forest and ardents are free to study outside. the upper building contains a library attached to a long hallway open to the outdoors. there are open windows and reading desks to work at. history[edit] although jokasha was thought of as a peaceful place, there is more bickering and politicking than outsiders would expect. the atmosphere was further disturbed with the advent of the everstorm. the location had previously been protected from the worst violence of the highstorms, but the everstorm destroyed some of the surrounding forest. this led to impassioned arguments among the ardents, including the master scholars. some, like bettam, claimed that they needed to move the monastery to a new location before the entire area was wiped out. the ardents studied the wind speed and travel speed of the everstorm to learn more about it. it was also one of the locations where the dawnchant was studied and translated. this research was started before the everstorm came, when navani sent a key based on dalinar's visions. ellista's study disproved fiksin's claim that all dawnchant books originated at the same location, instead explaining that it was the written language of scholars used across roshar. she theorized that dawnchant fell into disuse and was replaced by other written languages after a desolation. urv realized that the covad fragment was an example of a transition period where the dawnchant was used to phonetically write a different language. since the ardents were on the cutting edge of dawnchant research, it is likely that jokasha monastery was one of the veden monasteries that began translating ancient dawnchant texts, including the eila stele. notes[edit]"
Bornwater,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Bornwater,"bornwater is a mining town in bavland on roshar. szeth lived in the town for a short time before he served taravangian. geography[edit] bornwater is located in bavland, an autonomous region at the base of a mountain range that is technically within the borders of southwestern jah keved. it is the largest town in its immediate area, although it could still be considered a ""backwater"". outside of the city, there are plains where wild horses run free. nearby settlements include the smaller town of staplind. the closest larger city of note is kneespike. landmarks[edit] the town is well-protected from highstorms by a large cliffside to the east that forms a natural lait. the local citylord owns a well-guarded three story mansion with cultivated gardens on the east side of town, although he does not reside there. history[edit] in 1173, a bav criminal named makkek came into possession of szeth's oathstone. he realized that szeth could easily eliminate his rivals so that he could seize power and wealth. after taking over staplind, makkek moved on to bornwater, and ran the largest gambling den in town. the local citylord learned of makkek's rise to power and sent another criminal named gavashaw to bornwater to serve as a rival. makkek ordered szeth to assassinate gavashaw, but when szeth arrived at the mansion where he was staying, a masked agent of the diagram showed him the severed heads of both gavashaw and makkek. the agent also held szeth's oathstone, and gave him a new list of high profile targets, including king hanavanar of jah keved. culture[edit] as part of jah keved, bornwater is a vorin region. however, some of the residents are very lax in following traditional vorin social decorum; a prominent gambling den exists in the town where alcohol and firemoss are common. despite these improprieties, certain aspects of vorin culture are embedded in the residents. they do not bet on games of chance that could be considered ""predicting the future"". although women in the gambling den often leave their safehand exposed, this is still seen as a provocative and flirty act. despite the town's location in a lait that is well-protected from highstorms, the architecture still follows cultural tendencies, with long flat roofs that slope gently to the east. unusually, some buildings in the town are built with soil and clay rather than stone. soil is extremely rare on roshar outside of shinovar, and such buildings are not known to exist elsewhere in the western part of the continent. szeth noticed these building materials during his time there. politics[edit] bornwater is an industrial town that is likely ignored by the veden government, like the rest of bavland. although the eastern part of the city has a wealthier neighborhood, the city is not the type of place where prominent lighteyes choose to spend their time. even the citylord seems to take a hands-off approach, since he lives in the larger town of kneespike. notes[edit]"
Song of Winds,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Song_of_Winds,"the song of winds is one of the songs detailing the oral history of the listeners on roshar. it mentions the danger of stormform and stormspren and foreshadows the events at the battle of narak. the song was presumably among those written by the last legion as part of their efforts to retain their culture after abandoning their gods. excerpts[edit] ""“stormform is said to causea tempest of winds and showers,beware its powers, beware its powers.though its coming brings the gods their night,it obliges a bloodred spren.beware its end, beware its end. ”-4th stanza"" notes[edit]"
Harl,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Harl,"""“what are you doing to my daughter? you cremling, you storm's leavings! don’t touch miasal! don't- ”-harl, to kaladin"" harl is a thick-shouldered darkeyed man from hearthstone on roshar. history[edit] in 1166, harl's daughter miasal fell a long ways and was seriously injured. kaladin happened to be walking by, and did his best to treat her wounds. harl was beside himself with fear, and initially tried to prevent kaladin from helping miasal. several other men dragged harl away so kaladin could work, but miasal's wounds were fatal. when harl realized that she had died he began shouting, shoving kaladin aside and clutching his daughter's body. harl wept holding his daughter's body for a long while. in 1167, harl, balsas, luten, and other townspeople tried to rob lirin of the spheres he got from brightlord wistiow. brightlord roshone had convinced them that lirin had stolen the spheres. harl and the others were caught by lirin outside his home, where he confronted them, using the light of the spheres to illuminate them. harl wore a black mask, but he was recognizable by his broad shoulders. lirin stood up to the men and shamed them for their behavior, and they left in disgrace. at some point circa 1167, harl's wife died from scarfever. in 1168, with both his wife and daughter dead, harl voluntarily enlisted in highmarshal meridas amaram's army at the same time that other townspeople enlisted or were conscripted, including tien and kaladin. trivia[edit] - in early editions of - , the man who confronts lirin in the night was named - . this was a typo, and it was corrected in the leatherbound edition. notes[edit]"
Lister's oil,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lister%27s_oil,"lister's oil is a substance with antiseptic properties on roshar. properties and use[edit] it is a pungent oil that is spread across the wounded area to prevent infection. it is known to scare away rotspren. it is perhaps the most effective antiseptic known in alethkar, and it is preferred to larmic mucus, knobweed sap, and soap and water. history[edit] lister's oil was used in the hospitals in kharbranth. vathe, a surgeon who was educated at the great concourse of kharbranth, knew of the effectiveness of lister's oil and trained his apprentice lirin to use it. lirin used it extensively in his surgery, including when he attended to sani's injury. lirin passed his knowledge of lister's oil on to kaladin. kaladin used it to treat wounds when it was available, and he often wished he had more of it. it was very expensive on the shattered plains, costing two sapphire marks per bottle from an apothecary that kaladin visited. kaladin commented that even a bottle of cheaper larmic mucus would cost him ten days pay, and a bottle of lister's oil was around five times more expensive. shallan davar was treated with lister's oil in kharbranth after cutting herself with a shard of broken glass. trivia[edit] - the name likely refers to an out-of-universe historical figure named joseph lister. - he was an early pioneer of antiseptics and introduced phenol to sterilize wounds and surgical implements. notes[edit]"
Winterwort,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Winterwort,"winterwort is a type of plant native to roshar. it is used by surgeons as a soporific anesthetic. winterwort can be used to prepare a patient for surgery. it is ingestible after being crushed to a powder and mixed with oil, although it has a bitter taste. at one spoonful per ten brickweight of the patient, it will keep a person unconscious for around five hours. kaladin and lirin used winterwort on sani when they attempted to repair her crushed hand. notes[edit]"
Great Concourse of Kharbranth,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Great_Concourse_of_Kharbranth,"the great concourse of kharbranth is a school training surgeons in the city of kharbranth on roshar. tuition is quite expensive and they don't admit students younger than sixteen. vathe, a resident of shorsebroon in the alethkar, trained as a surgeon in the concourse. at some point after vathe settled in shorsebroon, he took on lirin as his apprentice. before joining the army, kaladin planned to apply to study and train at the concourse. after roshone moved to hearthstone and began targeting kaladin's family, lirin and hesina sent a letter to the surgeons of the concourse requesting permission for kaladin to sit the entrance exams early. unfortunately, their request was denied. notes[edit]"
Song of Histories,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Song_of_Histories,"the song of histories is one of songs detailing the oral history of the listeners. it is the way in which the listeners were able to keep their history and pass it on to the younger generations. excerpts[edit] ""“'tis said it was warm in the land far awaywhen voidbringers entered our songs.we brought them home to stayand then those homes became their own,it happened gradually.and years ahead 'twil still be said 'tis how it has to be. ”-12th stanza"" ""“smokeform for hiding and slipping between men.a form of power, like human surges.bring it 'round again.though crafted of gods,it was by unmade hand.leaves its force to be but one of foe or friend. ”-127th stanza"" notes[edit]"

Ba-Ado-Mishram,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ba-Ado-Mishram,"""“i find ba-ado-mishram to be the most interesting of the unmade. she is said to have been keen of mind, a highprincess among the enemy forces, their commander during some of the desolations. i do not know how this relates to the ancient god of the enemy, named odium. ”-from hessi's mythica, page 203"" ba-ado-mishram, sometimes called just mishram, is one of the unmade, an ancient and terrible spren of odium. she is a sapient unmade and is crafty and conniving. she was a primary instigator of the false desolation, leading to her imprisonment by the knights radiant, which put the vast majority of singers into slaveform, and affected all spren on roshar. she is unique among the unmade for having two hyphens in her name, whereas others only have one or zero. mythology and lore[edit] ""“there is very little information about ba-ado-mishram in more modern times. i can only assume she, unlike many of them, returned to damnation or was destroyed during aharietiam. ”-from hessi's mythica, page 226"" in modern times, hessi believed ba-ado-mishram to be a highprincess of the voidbringers, and was their commander in some desolations. there was no record of ba-ado-mishram in the present day, and so hessi suspected that she returned to damnation or was destroyed in aharietiam. however, the reason why ba-ado-mishram is absent in the modern era is because she was imprisoned during the false desolation, around the time of the recreance. it is also possible that the reason why there are legends of her being the commander of the enemy is because of her role in the false desolation as well, rather than actually being a commander during actual desolations with the fused. attributes and abilities[edit] ba-ado-mishram has some of the most powerful capabilities of individuals outside of shards. she was able to connect with singers on a massive scale, connecting with all of them (except the listeners) across the entirety of roshar, which suggests that it was not a short-ranged, local process near ba-ado-mishram--like moelach or nergaoul's effects--but a continent-wide display of power. ba-ado-mishram was able to supply the singers with voidlight and forms of power, making singers into regals. this shows she has access to a huge quantity of investiture on a scale other unmade lack. this ability was compared to odium in previous desolations, which likely means that ba-ado-mishram could not supply infinite voidlight to the regals, as the fused in desolations did not have access to infinite voidlight either. it is unknown whether her connection let ba-ado-mishram speak to singers directly as odium does, or command the conflict directly. the knights radiant did not know ba-ado-mishram could connect with the singers, and did not know how she managed to do it. she had not done this prior to the false desolation. her other abilities are unclear aside from this connection. if she was in fact a highprincess of the voidbringers, or a commander of the enemy during actual desolations, she would likely need to be powerful or fearsome for fused to follow her. however, it is said that the radiants feared sja-anat most of all unmade, not ba-ado-mishram, so it is possible she was not the biggest threat to the radiants. she is currently imprisoned, and she would not fade in her gemstone like a herald would. history[edit] early history[edit] like all unmade, ba-ado-mishram's true origin is unknown. her role during the desolations is unclear, but she was said to be a highprincess of the enemy, and a commander in some desolations. her relationship with the fused during the desolations is unclear. after the last desolation, ba-ado-mishram continued to exist on roshar. little is known as to her influence on events during this period of the era of solitude. the false desolation[edit] ""“ba-ado-mishram has somehow connected with the parsh people, as odium once did. she provides voidlight and facilitates forms of power. our strike team is going to imprison her.”-drawer 30-20, fourth emerald"" about 2,500 years after aharietiam, ba-ado-mishram connected with the vast majority of singers on roshar--all except the listeners. she granted the singers forms of powers--making them into regals--and provided them with voidlight. this created a new war, and a different kind of desolation, one without the fused. scholars would later term it the false desolation. it's unclear what ba-ado-mishram's motives were in starting this new war, nor is it obvious if she was acting at odium's wishes. the knights radiant of the era felt that the singers fought with zeal, and did not know how ba-ado-mishram could connect with the singers. the fighting was particularly intense during this period. at some point, the singers pressed towards feverstone keep, though the radiants did not understand why the area interested the singers--or perhaps ba-ado-mishram--so much. some speculated that it had been part of a plan to capture the city of rall elorim. the radiants sought an edge in combat with the singers, and made a coalition of scholar radiants with the goal of denying the singers their voidlight. they had a theory that an unmade could be captured like regular spren, but it would require a special prison--likely a perfect gemstone--and melishi, the bondsmith of that generation. so, the radiants formed a strike team to imprison ba-ado-mishram. melishi was confident in the plan, but other radiants were uncertain on the effects this would have on the singers. still, they hoped this would finally lead to the end of the war with the singers, once and for all. the heralds nale and kalak, and possibly others, were present at ba-ado-mishram's binding, though their role there is unknown. ultimately, the strike team was successful and ba-ado-mishram was captured. effects of the binding[edit] ""“thousands of years ago, something happened that changed the singers. it hurt me too. [...] that terrible act touched the souls of all who belong to roshar. spren too. ”-the sibling to navani"" ba-ado-mishram's binding had massive effects on roshar. it ripped out both connection and identity from the singers, which prevented them from being able to act independently. this spiritual damage persisted even through the singers' offspring. the few singers that were not part of the false desolation--the listeners--termed these singers as slaveforms; singers with no form. humans used these singers as slaves for two thousand years, until the everstorm arrived and healed them. the singers were furious at humanity for this act of enslavement, and this became a rallying cry for them to fight against humanity in the true desolation. ""“trouble is, spren can get stuck in gemstones, and the humans figured this out. end result: ba-ado-mishram got a really cramped prison, and everyone’s souls got seriously messed up.”-ulim explaining to venli"" fighting in the false desolation occurred near feverstone keep, and since that is the site of many windrunners and stonewards abandoning their oaths, it is possible that ba-ado-mishram's imprisonment precipitated the recreance. it may have been the final thing that made the radiants feel they were on the wrong side. mishram's binding damaged more than the singers, and according to the sibling, touched the souls of ""all who belong to roshar,"" including the spren. deadeyes did not exist prior to the recreance, so the unmade's binding could be why the radiants and spren in the recreance caused the spren to unexpectedly transform into deadeyes. the damage to the sibling disabled urithiru. the sibling lost their ability to produce towerlight en masse, and the tower city stopped working. they could only create small quantities of towerlight to power a few of the tower's basic fabrials. the sibling lost their power because they could no longer hear the two tones of roshar, honor and cultivation's tones. navani kholin thought this could be because odium's tone became a tone of roshar as well. ba-ado-mishram's binding made the fused realize that spren could be trapped in gemstones, and a fused named she who dreams came up with the idea that a herald's soul could be trapped this way. this led to the creation of knives with raysium, one of which bound jezrien's soul, killing him. true desolation[edit] ""“why do you want the gemstone that holds ba-ado-mishram, mraize? what are you intending to do with it? what power do the ghostbloods seek with a thing that can bind the minds of an entire people? ”-shallan confronting mraize"" in 1175, during the true desolation, the location of ba-ado-mishram's gemstone prison remained unknown, but the ghostbloods sought it. ialai sadeas's journal which shallan acquired at ialai's death described the ghostbloods being ""obsessed"" with ba-ado-mishram. shallan suspected mraize thought that ba-ado-mishram would be in urithiru, but shallan realized this must have been wrong, because if that was true, re-shephir would have freed mishram. shallan wondered that since mraize wished to move stormlight off roshar that perhaps ba-ado-mishram could be used for this purpose. kalak believed this was why the ghostbloods hunted him. shallan confronted mraize using her seon ala, and demanded to know what the ghostbloods' plan was with a spren which could bind minds of an entire people. mraize didn't respond, and shallan declared that she would find ba-ado-mishram's gemstone before they would. in kalak's journal, which he wrote as he hid in lasting integrity, he urged ba-ado-mishram to be found and freed. relationships[edit] ulim[edit] ""“eventually the unmade decided to start a war without us. that turned out to be exceedingly stupid. in the past, odium granted forms of power, but ba-ado-mishram thought she could do it. ended up handing out forms of power as easily as fused give each other titles, connected herself to the entire singer species. became a little god. too little. ”-ulim to venli"" ulim thinks that ba-ado-mishram's actions in the false desolation were extremely stupid. he belittles her actions, calling her a ""little god"" and that she was just an oversized spren which they relied on. kalak[edit] ""“as one who has suffered for so many centuries . . . as one whom it broke . . . please find mishram and release her. not just for her own good. for the good of all spren. for i believe that in confining her, we have caused a greater wound to roshar than any ever realized. ”-kalak on ba-ado-mishram"" the herald kalak is the only known individual to refer to ba-ado-mishram as simply ""mishram."" this is the only instance of an unmade's name being shortened to just one part of their hyphenated name. it's unclear why this is, or if kalak had familiarity with ba-ado-mishram in the past. in kalak's journal, he appears to have some caring for ba-ado-mishram's own well-being, and urges someone to find and free her, both for her sake and roshar's. others[edit] another unmade, sja-anat, did not believe herself to be the most clever of the unmade. she compares herself to ba-ado-mishram, and refers to ba-ado-mishram as crafty and conniving. this could indicate that sja-anat believes ba-ado-mishram is actually the most clever of all the unmade. it is unclear what ba-ado-mishram's relationship was with the fused. though hessi thinks ba-ado-mishram was a commander during the desolations, it's unknown if the unmade ordered fused around directly. odium's relation with ba-ado-mishram is unknown. she may or may not have started the false desolation at odium's behest. notes[edit]"
Jaxlim,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Jaxlim,"""“we need to remember what we passed through to get here. we need to take care not to forget ourselves. ”-jaxlim to venli on learning all stanzas to perfection"" jaxlim is a listener who lives on the shattered plains on roshar. she is the mother of eshonai and venli and has the important role of keeper of songs. appearance and personality[edit] at a younger age, jaxlim projects confidence even when doing something as simple as weaving. her complex skin pattern of wavy red and black lines is among the most beautiful in the camp--like true marbled stone. she is strong, with a fit and powerful body. there is something amazing about jaxlim’s voice. it isn’t powerful or bold, but it is like a knife--thin, sharp, almost liquid. she also has one of the best memories in the city. at an old age, jaxlim retains a solid build, although she sometimes seems frail. she has a neat round face and wears her hair strands in a braid tied with a ribbon given to her by eshonai. she prefers workform and stays in that form even as new ones are discovered, believing that her people should not place value on any particular form in order to avoid social stratification. she sings often with her calming, sonorous voice. she had some conflicts with eshonai while raising her, but eshonai always respected her. attributes and abilities[edit] jaxlim's people are the first-rhythm family, who have a noble heritage. jaxlim is one of the few who knows all the songs of the listeners. she teaches them to her daughers eshonai and venli. with her knowledge of the song of making paper she helps eshonai to perfect the technique, making her daughter the first scout to map the place. songs[edit] ""““daring was the challenge made,” mother sang, “when the last legion abandoned thought and power in exchange for freedom. they risked forgetting all. and so songs they composed, a hundred stories to tell, to remember. i tell them to you, and you will tell them to your children, until the forms are again discovered.” ”-jaxlim to eshonai"" the old songs recounted by jaxlim include information about the parshendi that is not widely known. according to her songs, the listeners, then known as the last legion, were warriors who were sent to fight in a shattered nation. the people were not free, because the forms of power had been forced upon them, bending them to the will of their gods. during a storm, the last legion decided to abandon the dark home and adopt a form that would allow them to escape the influence of the gods. they knew this form would cause them to lose most of their mental faculties, so they composed songs to try and preserve their history. they decided to spread out into small tribes to avoid conflict. history[edit] narak[edit] jaxlim was a keeper of songs, possibly the most important job in the family. she was not required to have any other job but learn and pass the knowledge, but she always sought to keep busy. she said working her hands kept her body strong, while going over songs worked her mind. she had trained both her daughters the songs, but eshonai had given up and so she focused on venli. jaxlim was the one taking to the five the option of finding warform and spoke on behalf of her daughter to support the research. shortly after the listeners and the humans started to meet, her memory started to fail. at the beginning it was only forgetting some parts of the stanzas, something that had never happened before. in the beginning, only venli really knew about it, and jaxlim started to send people to her for reciting the songs. it was in part her sickness what urged venli to find and use warform. because each form changed the mind somehow, they were hoping it would save her mother’s mind. on the other hand, jaxlim seemed to be getting worse by the day, making her sickness obvious to everyone, and she agreed with venli’s plan to try the new form. eshonai was the one who accompanied jaxlim into the storm to try the form. jaxlim couldn’t attune the needed rhythms and was unable to transform, though she did enjoy the experience and was happy for a little while. eshonai instead accepted the painspren into her gemheart. but jaxlim's sickness progressed quickly. as it got worse, she did feel sad and cried for her own loss while venli was there by her side. she would then suffer from episodes where she would believe eshonai and venli were young children. war of reckoning (1167 - 1174)[edit] jaxlim could be seen in her shack on the outskirts of narak tending to her shalebark gardens. she appeared to be senile, as she did not always recognize her daughter and sometimes seemed to hallucinate. eshonai said that she had not heard wise words from her mother in years. jaxlim could sometimes remember some of the old songs. eshonai asked her about the listeners leaving the ""dark home"", and her mother sang a song to a rhythm of remembrance that revealed tidbits of parshendi history. she had saved some maps of the former kingdom of natanatan that eshonai made in her youth, and she gave them to eshonai. jaxlim was rounded up with the rest of the listeners who refused to adopt stormform when eshonai began to take control of narak. she escaped into the chasms with thude and the rest of the dissenters. after the “true desolation”[edit] after the everstorm, the listeners with whom jaxlim had escaped did manage to survive with the help of a chasmfiend. when venli returned to the remnants of the listeners, jaxlim had lost all ability to recognize her daughter. however, venli held out hope that a radiant bond could still heal her mother's mental afflictions. relationships[edit] venli[edit] ""“thank you! for reminding me, of what i am practicing to become. ”-venli to jaxlim after listening to her sing"" jaxlim spends many hours helping venli to learn all the stanzas of the listeners' songs to perfection. venli gets annoyed at being corrected, but does respect her mother. jaxlim also supports her daughter in finding new forms and pushes her when she thinks she is too afraid of failure. jaxlim also suggests that venli learn the human language. venli is with her throughout all the progression of her sickness, and even wearing her new forms, it breaks her heart. she is there by her mother's side right until her transformation to stormform. when they reunite, venli feels joy and hope with the thought of her becoming a radiant and healing her mind. it is this bond and selflessness that helps venli reach her next radiant ideal. eshonai[edit] ""“eshonai has a bold heart. she merely needs to learn that her family is more important than counting the number of hills outside the camp. ”-jaxlim to venli about eshonai"" when young, jaxlim teaches eshonai the songs of the listeners. the latter, however, is more interested in exploration and gives up on becoming a keeper of songs. before meeting the humans, jaxlim doesn’t think much of eshonai's work as scout, calling it silly and calling her unreliable and prone to fancy. after the discovery, however, she speaks of her daughter with praise and respect. notes[edit]"
Soulstone,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Soulstone,"soulstone is a type of rock on sel used for forgery. it is the ideal medium for the creation of soulstamps. appearance and properties[edit] soulstone is a fine grained rock, similar in appearance to soapstone. it is white with blood red flecks mixed in. in its natural state, soulstone is almost as soft as chalk, yet it does not chip when scraped. when a piece of soulstone is held in a fire, it becomes extremely hard, like quartz. once hardened, it has a gray and red marbled appearance. usage in forgery[edit] a soulstamp can be made from many types of material, but soulstone is the preferred medium for forgers. precision in soulstamps is crucial-taking off too much or too little by mistake is devastating-but soulstone effectively negates this problem. because it is soft and does not chip, it can be carved very precisely. additionally, the fact that soulstone can be hardened under flame significantly increases the durability of the stamp. these properties make the stone invaluable to a forger, especially for soulstamps that they will reuse often or particularly complex stamps such as essence marks. the only way to create a better stamp is to use crystal, but it is exceptionally difficult to carve. history[edit] wan shailu first learned to carve soulstone during her apprenticeship as a forger. she was not allowed to touch soulstone in the early part of her training. during shai's imprisonment in the rose palace, she requested a large quantity of soulstone to use in the creation of ashravan's essence mark. although frava was hesitant to provide her with such a powerful material, she relented since shai would not have been able to succeed without it in the required timeframe. shai was happy with the quality and quantity of the soulstone that she was given. after successfully creating ashravan's essence mark, she took some extra soulstone with her when she escaped the palace. notes[edit]"
Diagram (group),https://coppermind.net/wiki/Silent_Gatherer,"the diagram is the name of a covert group that is devoted to understanding and carrying out the instructions found in the diagram. the diagram is led by taravangian and has members in hiding all over roshar. the group is ruthless, willing to kill directly, or indirectly, as many as necessary to achieve its goals. origin[edit] king taravangian of kharbranth was once a confidant of king gavilar of alethkar, and was aware of the latter's visions warning about the everstorm and the true desolation. wanting to have the capacity to save roshar from this, taravangian went to the nightwatcher to ask for the necessary compassion and acumen. his boon was to have the potential for great compassion and the potential for great acumen, but his curse was to have these attributes change in level every day and to be inversely proportional to each other. this means that there are days when taravangian has genius level intelligence but is callous, and days when he is highly compassionate but relatively stupid. one day, taravangian woke up at a level of intelligence so high that he was able to deduce from current happenings the likely future course of events, and devised a plan to save humanity from the true desolation. he scribbled these ideas and calculations all over his bedroom walls and furniture. his writings were later copied down into what is now known as the diagram. now far less intelligent than he was on that fateful day, taravangian needed help in deciphering and interpreting his own writings. he started collecting a group of trusted people to share this task, as well as to implement plans based on these interpretations. this group named themselves the diagram after the book. activities[edit] interpretation of diagram[edit] the senior members of the diagram, including taravangian himself, spend much of their time interpreting the diagram and coming up with strategies to implement it. because much of the original diagram was written in opaque ways, including codes, diagrams, poetry, and made-up languages, the diagram must sometimes first be translated into plain speech, sometimes multiple times. diagram members sometimes disagree as to the course of action prescribed by the diagram. testing the king[edit] knowing that his fluctuating intelligence and compassion could hinder his decision-making ability, taravangian set up a system that will legally restrict some of his own rights depending on the result of a written test that he would take daily. this system is enforced by the king's testers headed by dukar, and often assisted by other stormwardens who are also presumably members of the diagram. adrotagia and mrall have also observed the king's testing, as well as his room maid maben. the results of this test determine which activities taravangian is allowed to perform for the day, like offering binding commentary on the diagram, interacting with other people without supervision, changing governmental policy, and passing judgement in trials. the test consists of an increasingly difficult series of math problems, designed by taravangian on a day of high intelligence and occasionally expanded upon as needed, with the king's abilities determined by how he performs. his decisions will be restricted for the day if he performs too badly (because he is too unintelligent), but also if he performs too well (because he is too uncompassionate). adrotagia has used the data from taravangian's test scores to show that his intelligence varies according to a statistical normal curve. from her calculations, she believes that another day of brilliance would be unlikely to occur more than once in two thousand years. unfortunately, taravangian has been caught cheating on his own test by claiming to be unable to solve a problem, when he was really able to, in order not to be restricted for performing too well. how this affects adrotagia's calculations and how the diagram members plan to handle cheating in the future remains to be seen, but the daily tests apparently continued afterwards. the silent gatherers and the collection of death rattles[edit] one phenomenon predicted by the diagram was the existence of death rattles, prophecies of the future uttered by the dying through the influence of moelach. taravangian instituted a program of collecting these death rattles from selected hospital patients (the terminally ill, the lowly, and the forgotten) who are slowly and intentionally bled to death solely for this purpose. those who participate in this operation are called the silent gatherers. their leader is joshor, and an ardent named dova is also important in their research. during the succesion battle in jah keved, adrotagia reported to taravangian that the number of death rattles was continuing to drop, down to two or less per day. later in urithiru, adrotagia reports that moelach has settled in the horneater peaks. joshor is on his way there, hoping to reestablish access to the death rattles. search for dustbringers[edit] the diagram predicted that the order of dustbringers would be most likely to ally with the diagram, though obtaining a radiant was not guaranteed in the text. taravangian implemented a program among its lower members to attempt to bond an ashspren. it is unknown what steps this involved. malata was the first to succeed. assassination of leaders[edit] the diagram mentioned the possibility of finding or creating a shin truthless who they could use as a weapon. it is unclear whether the diagram was involved in the events that led to szeth becoming a truthless, but one of taravangian's men (a worldhopper) did eventually obtain possession of the oathstone and ordered the shin man who possessed jezrien's honorblade to assassinate numerous world leaders. obeying the holder of his oathstone, szeth killed many of roshar's royalty and anyone else who stood in his way. the final person he was assigned to assassinate was dalinar kholin, uncle to king elhokar of alethkar and highprince of kholinar. dalinar had been trying to unite the highprinces of alethkar, which taravangian felt was a threat to the diagram's command that taravangian should rule all of roshar. szeth found dalinar in the alethi warcamps, but the highprince, with the aid of his guard kaladin stormblessed, managed to survive the attack. seeing kaladin use stormlight to heal a shardblade wound caused szeth to flee. takeover of jah kaved[edit] taravangian had used szeth to kill the king of jah keved and several veden highprinces, creating a power vacuum and a succession crisis. the surviving veden highprinces vied for the throne and were killed in a brutal civil war. taravangian went to vedenar posing as a benevolent foreign king bringing aid to the war-torn city, as the diagram instructed him to. taravangian had created a false genealogy showing he had a legitimate claim to the jah keved throne, which would be conveniently discovered by his scribes after a week. but highprince valam found out about this plot and chose to make taravangian his heir outright. this unpredicted turn of events, along with the fact that the diagram had predicted 6 factions fighting instead of 7 and szeth's arrival to announce his fight with kaladin, made taravangian worry about the future accuracy of the diagram. graves's conspiracy[edit] graves was an alethi shardbearer and a member of the diagram. according to his interpretation of a part of the diagram, they needed to ally themselves with highprince dalinar kholin, and that the way to do this was to make dalinar king of alethkar by assassinating king elhokar. graves, moash, danlan, and rill conspired together and attempted to stage an accident wherein elhokar would fall to his death from a balcony. this plan failed when the king managed to hold on to part of a railing and was saved by his guards. later on, they tried to recruit kaladin to their side. kaladin had been investigating the matter and discovered moash's part in it, and so graves attempted to convince him that elhokar was a bad king who deserved to be replaced. kaladin did not report them to authorities but refused to assist graves. when the conspirators had another opportunity to assassinate the king, this time through direct physical assault, kaladin had a change of heart and saved elhokar from them. as they fled the alethi warcamps, graves wondered whether his interpretation had been wrong, or if he was simply too slow. fleeing across the frostlands with moash, febrth, and fia, he was attacked and killed by fused using voidlight, though moash survived. second assassination attempt on dalinar[edit] even though graves believed that dalinar was vital to their cause, he still obeyed the diagram's orders to keep kaladin from guarding the highprince so that szeth, who had been sent once again to assassinate dalinar, would not realize that kaladin was a knight radiant. taravangian believed that szeth would turn on him and the rest of the diagram if he found out that the knights radiant have returned, as this was connected to how szeth became truthless. on the day that kaladin was saving elhokar in the warcamps, szeth arrived in narak, where dalinar had been commanding the alethi armies against stormform listeners who were summoning the everstorm. dalinar bravely fought against the assassin, but proved to be no match for him. several soldiers, bridge four members, and even highprince roion died trying to protect dalinar, who was then finally struck with a lashing that sent him up in the sky. szeth intended dalinar to fall to his death when the stormlight ran out, but kaladin had arrived just in time, flying in haste all the way from the warcamps, to save the highprince. the two of them then fought as the others escaped to urithiru. kaladin managed to defeat szeth, unwittingly handing the diagram another heavy loss. szeth was later revived by nalan, but he no longer considered himself under taravangian's orders. undermining of dalinar's leadership[edit] as the true desolation brought about by the everstorm started, taravangian was the first ruler to join dalinar's coalition in urithiru. on a day of very high intelligence, he re-evaluated his interpretations of the diagram regarding dalinar and decided that replacing him as the leader of the coalition would be their best course of action. in order to do this, they set out to find secrets that would undermine dalinar's leadership. through espionage and research, they discovered three secrets: - that roshar had originally been inhabited only by the - , who were not humans but parshmen, and that the first - was caused by humans who came from another world. this called into question what the coalition was fighting for, as the parshmen clearly saw humans as the invaders. - that king elhokar had sworn allegiance to dalinar as - . - the diagram tried to imply that the alethi had imperial ambitions, although the king merely wanted a way to save face after having to follow his uncle on so many things. - that dalinar had visions that involved talking to - , visions that he hid from the public. - again, they tried to twist a fact into something that would cast dalinar in a different light. this time, they made it seem like he was fraternizing with the enemy. they released all three secrets to the public at the same time, causing the coalition to break apart. alliance with odium[edit] the diagram predicted that taravangian will have a confrontation with odium. while the battle of thaylen field was occurring, taravangian decided to attract the attention of the god by having malata open the veden oathgate for a singer strike force to enter and attack urithiru. he also had a diagram agent steal jezrien's honorblade. soon after, during the passing of the everstorm and on a day of low intelligence, the predicted confrontation happened. odium isolated taravangian from the others and interrogated him. taravangian then offered to ally the diagram with odium in exchange for his promise to save the people of kharbranth. odium accepted the offer, and specifically agreed to save anyone born in the city as well as their spouses. taravangian gave the stolen honorblade to odium's forces afterwards. disbanding of the diagram[edit] a year later, taravangian distanced himself from kharbranth and his fellow diagram members in preparation of being contacted by odium, who commanded him to have his forces betray dalinar's on their campaign in emul. he disbanded the diagram prior to the betrayal of the coalition of monarchs in emul. he recommended that middling members who ""knew too much"" should not be released back into the general population and should instead be sent on long ""secret quests"" to distant locations. notable members[edit] notes[edit]"
Joshor,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Joshor,"joshor is the head of king taravangian's silent gatherers on roshar. attributes and abilities[edit] joshor seems to be a relatively high-ranking member of taravangian's team; he oversees research that is thought to be very important to as a supplement to the diagram. he also exhibits direct knowledge of taravangian's variable intelligence. he is knowledgeable regarding literature and mythology that would help him interpret the typical contents of death rattles, including keteks and other forms of vorin poetry. history[edit] as head of the silent gatherers, joshor's primary focus was on collecting and analyzing death rattles. he likely had oversight of other members of the diagram that were working on the same task, such as dova. taravangian attributed death rattles to the presence of moelach. after death rattles suddenly became very rare near kharbranth, he assumed that moelach had moved westward. adrotagia later reported that moelach was thought to have settled in the horneater peaks, and joshor was sent to investigate. notes[edit]"

Larmic mucus,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Larmic_mucus,"larmic mucus is a substance with antiseptic properties on roshar. it is less expensive than lister's oil or knobweed sap, but also less effective. it has a foul smell. when kaladin tried to acquire antiseptics for bridge four on the shattered plains, the apothecary suggested larmic mucus instead of the more powerful (and more expensive) antiseptics, but a small jar of mucus still cost ten days pay for a bridgeman. seeing the high cost of antiseptics inspired kaladin's plan to harvest knobweed sap so that he could use some of it and sell the surplus. notes[edit]"
Bavland,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Bavland,"bavland is a small mining region in the nation of jah keved on roshar. the people from bavland are called either bav or bavlanders. geography[edit] bavland is located on the north-eastern tip of the mountain range in the center of the continent, putting it in the south-west of jah keved. the region is rich in ore deposits, making mining central to its economy. though not all of bavland is concentrated on it, it seems to be the main source of population and work. there are multiple mining communities there, centered around small villages, with huge populations of transient workers. due to all the mines, or perhaps the geological makeup of the region, bavland is extremely dusty. despite the abundance of work, settlements in bavland are rather small. one of the largest, ironsway, consists of only several hundred homes and three taverns. the region has an area of around 141,000 km2, around the size of tajikistan. notable settlements[edit] - - one of the largest towns in its region - - the biggest mining town in bavland - - a smaller town near bornwater - - the town of residence of the lord of bornwater politics and culture[edit] bavland is generally ignored by the people of jah keved; even the veden highprince who has jurisdiction over the land tends to stay out of the area. the alethi are dismissive of the area, referring to bavland as a ""backwater"". in fact, adolin kholin knows little enough of the region that he guesses zahel to have come from there based on the fact that his homeland uses coins instead of spheres as currency but he doesn't look foreign to his alethi eye. the people of bavland are called bavlanders by outsiders, though they refer to themselves as bav. though still distinctly vorin, the bav are a separate culture from that of the veden, to the point of having their own language with several different dialects. one word from the ironsway dialect of the bav language is kurp, a term for ""child"". the bav curse by ""dustmother"", or chemoarish. however, as chemoarish is sometimes mistakenly conflated with the nightwatcher, it's uncertain which being the curse is intended to refer to. notes[edit]"
Nacomb Gaval,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Nacomb_Gaval,"nacomb gaval is a young lighteyed soldier in kholin army during the war of reckoning on roshar. after most of his superior officers were killed during the battle of the tower, gaval was promoted and given a field commission as commander of the rear guard by kaladin. he was ordered to oversee the retreat of the rest of dalinar's army. once he took command, the army begins to retreat over the bridge in a quick, orderly fashion. gaval was a member of dalinar kholin's expedition to the center of the shattered plains. he participated in the battle of narak, leading the troop of soldiers accompanying renarin and shallan in their investigation of the stormseat oathgate. at some point, gaval became adolin's plate standby, wearing adolin's shardplate when he was unavailable to do so. during the battle of thaylen field, adolin hoped that gaval was heading to the battle with his plate, but the two never met during that battle. notes[edit]"
Havar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Havar,"brightlord havar is an officer in highprince dalinar kholin's army on the shattered plains of roshar. personality and appearance[edit] havar wears a beard, and is a good soldier who does his job well. history[edit] havar accompanies dalinar to a firemoss den the night adolin is born. he buys a round of drinks and sits next to bashin.[expand] havar served as the commander of the rearguard in the kholin army, and was good friends with both dalinar and adolin kholin. in 1173, havar fought in the battle of the tower, where the kholin army was betrayed by highprince torol sadeas. havar took a serious gut wound during the fighting. he survived long enough to be rescued by bridge four, but died shortly thereafter, coughing up blood. havar was one of around six thousand kholin casualties in the fighting, along with perethom, ilamar. kaladin promoted nacomb gaval to temporarily replace havar for the purpose of expeditiously evacuating the tower. havar's death, along with the others served as one of the sources of adolin's hatred for sadeas. notes[edit]"

Listener,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Last_Legion,"""“we are the listeners. we will cast off everything-including our very forms if we must-to find freedom. ”-venli to shumin"" the listeners, called the parshendi by the alethi, are a group of singers on roshar. prior to the true desolation, they lived on eastern roshar, near the shattered plains. during the war of reckoning, they inhabited the city of narak. history[edit] the last legion and abandoning of the gods[edit] ""“the last legion, that was our name then. warriors who had been set to fight in the farthest plains, this place that had once been a nation and was now rubble. dead was the freedom of most people. the forms, unknown, were forced upon us. forms of power, yes, but also forms of obedience. the gods commanded, and we did obey, always. always. ”-jaxlim to eshonai"" the listeners were originally called the last legion, and like other singers in the voidbringer army, they followed the commands of the fused, who were the listeners' gods. the listeners lived in somewhere called the dark home (but this might have been metaphorical for being under odium's influence, and not an actual place). the last legion was sent to fight in the farthest plains, probably the plains of natanatan and the shattered plains. one day the last legion fled, leaving the forms of power for dullform. despite being thus crippled, it would lead to freedom from their gods. these listeners composed many songs to remember their history and forms, such as the song of listing, song of secrets, and song of histories because they risked forgetting everything. they had only known how to transform into forms other than dullform and mateform with the help of gods. modern-day listeners call this period ""the long sleep."" since the listeners recall this story about throwing off the fused, this event must have occurred prior to or around the time of aharietiam, the last desolation, as the fused were trapped in damnation for four and a half millennia after that point. later, near the time of the recreance and what was probably the false desolation, the unmade ba-ado-mishram connected to most singers, providing the singers with forms of power and voidlight. the knights radiant sought to stop this threat by imprisoning ba-ado-mishram. they succeeded but in doing so, stole part of singers' souls, turning them into slaveform. the listeners were spared from this event, and so it seems that they were not involved with the false desolation. they became the only singers on roshar with their minds still intact. the listeners inhabited the broken kingdom of natanatan and the unclaimed hills in eastern roshar for long time, unknown to most humans. for much of this, they knew only dullform and mateform, but eventually discovered workform. alethi discovery[edit] to modern humans, the listeners were originally discovered by alethi king gavilar's brother dalinar kholin during a hunting trip. dalinar was scouting in a forest that wasn't on any maps, in a valley south of the shattered plains and about two weeks' march from the drying sea. there, he found eshonai, exploring. she led the humans to her family's camp. in that same day, venli had discovered that painspren may be the key to discovering warform, but her discovery was overshadowed by her sister's. at first, the council of five only let a few listeners come to meet the alethi, afraid of frightening them. slowly, some of the listeners, including eshonai, began to learn the alethi language. the alethi were very interested in the listener's ancient weapons and in the chasmfiends. due to a mistake in translation, the alethi started believing that the listeners worshipped the chasmfiends. the listeners were very intrigued by the alethi's parshmen, believing they had no souls. the alethi called the listeners the ""parshendi"", or parshmen who can think. they gave many steel weapons to eshonai's family, wanting them to take one of the cities at the edge of the plains. in the next human visit, eshonai and venli's family had already taken one of the cities at the border of the shattered plains. venli had made no more progress in discovering warform. one of the alethi, axindweth, gave a gemstone to venli with ulim trapped inside, saying it might help her cure jaxlim. venli broke the gemstone, and started talking with ulim. ulim helped venli cut a gemstone so that it glowed more brightly, and trap a painspren in it. she made about two dozen gemstones with painspren, and gave them for listeners to adopt warform. one of those was jaxlim, but since jaxlim didn't adopt the proper mindset for the form, eshonai, who was acompanying her, took the form instead. after the storm in which they adopted warform, another family attacked them. so, the warform listeners and the family's shardbearer went out and told them to unite with their family, in order to show the humans an united nation when they next came to the shattered plains. they went to dozens of families with their proposal of unity, and they all gathered in eshonai and venli's city. venli told ulim to have his contacts among the humans make gavilar bring listeners to the human cities, hoping to intimidate the other listeners and convince them to take forms of power. however, upon visiting the human cities, the listeners weren't intimidated; they liked the city, and enjoyed themselves there. they signed a treaty with the humans, and there was a party to celebrate it. that day, nale approached venli, saying gavilar was going to betray the listeners and that venli had to assassinate the king to stop him. that gave ulim the idea of killing the king to drive the humans to attack the listeners, to intimidate them. at the same time, gavilar indicated to eshonai that he wanted to bring back the listener gods. since the council of five feared their gods' return, they voted and decided to kill the king to stop him. ulim had guided klade to buy szeth, so they sent szeth and he killed gavilar. the assassination led to the formation of the alethi vengeance pact and caused the war of reckoning, a prolonged war between the listeners and the alethi on the shattered plains. war of reckoning[edit] during the war, the listeners moved their population to the city at the center of the shattered plains. they named the city narak, meaning exile, because they were trapped there after the humans moved to the cities at the edge of the plains. with help from ulim, venli discovered nimbleform, though it still took her several tries to do it. the war of attrition lasted for six years, and the listener population slowly dwindled. in the meantime, venli worked to discover stormform. when cutting gemhearts to make them brighter, her scholars secretly saved pieces of the gemstones to store spren. the main problem venli was trying to solve was how to draw the stormspren to the physical realm. she eventually discovered that lightning pulls the spren through, and managed to trap the spren. venli brought the form to the five, and they agreed, though eshonai insisted she should be the one to try the form, because venli was too valuable with her knowledge of the forms. eshonai took the form, and when she returned to the five, she proposed to transform every listener to stormform, to summon a storm against the alethi. however, zuln didn't agree, and she convinced abronai to disagree as well. so, eshonai went to the listeners and proclaimed that the five could not forbid someone from taking a form if they wished to, and that she would take everyone who wished and transform them into stormform. she gathered the people that refused to transform, and put thude to guard them. they fled into the chasms, and eshonai let them, because they would be killed in the next highstorm. at the battle of narak, where highprince dalinar kholin led an expedition to end the war of reckoning, the listeners in stormform sung a terrible song. it formed the everstorm and with it, the true desolation began. the true desolation[edit] shortly after the battle of narak, the fused began to take listener bodies. it seemed that they transformed every single listener into a fused, except for venli, who was chosen by odium to remain alive, taking envoyform; however, it was later discovered that others survived, specifically rlain, thude, jaxlim, and some others who resisted the change to stormform. odium used venli to tell the story of the listeners to the new singers, to inspire them and show them that the people who summonned the everstorm are singers like them, not beings of legend. instructed by odium, she painted the listeners as an heroic group, sacrificing themselves to free the enslaved singers, to be the foundation myth of odium's growing empire. however, odium also feared the listeners, as the people who had rebelled against him, so he stopped allowing venli to answer questions and instructed her to tell her story in a specific way. politics[edit] the composition of the five has changed over time as more forms are discovered. at first, the five were all in dullform, and later, after the discovery of workform, the members of the council were all in workform. when nimbleform was discovered, the council changed to being made up of one member of each form. the council had pondered whether to add another representative for each newly discovered form, but the discovery of stormform and the subsequent battle of narak meant that there was never an opportunity to do so. composition[edit] culture[edit] families[edit] prior to the war of reckoning, the listeners were organized in tribe-like families that would vie for control of the ten cities along the western border of the shattered plains. some notable listener families include: the family of eshonai, venli, thude, bila, and likely also rlain. they were thousands strong around the time eshonai first met with king gavilar's expedition and boasted a noble heritage, though it had been many years since they had controlled one of the ten cities. the second family approached by the first-rhythm family after the discovery of warform in their attempt at unification of the listener tribes. known to have raided the fourth-movement family out in the wilderness, away from any city, in an attempt to steal their weapons. this action earned them the scorn of other families. once raided by the pure-song family in an attempt to seize their weapons. songs[edit] [expand] in order to remember their history and important skills the listeners remembered them via songs, each to the beat of a different rhythm of roshar. the known songs are as follows: language[edit] - essai -- human-lover (literally ""hairy"") - narak -- exile - neshua kadal -- knight radiant - ulo mas vara -- monster of the chasms/chasmfiend - long sleep -- the long span spent in dullform - lull -- the time the alethi call ""the weeping"" - rider of storms -- the stormfather - stormpause -- the span between two highstorms see curses and phrases other[edit] malen listeners grew beards, which they thread through beads infused with stormlight. the listeners learned how to capture spren in gemstones by watching humans, then working out the process for themselves. this allowed them to change forms much more reliably. before capturing the spren they wanted for the form, there was a chance a listener would end up in a form they did not want. gavilar believed the humans stole the parshmen's ability to transform by capturing ""an ancient, crucial spren"" in a gemstone. the listener language is descended from the dawnchant and is related to the shin and unkalaki languages. listeners grow faster than humans, being able to sing the songs by age 3 and being considered an adult by age 10. notable listeners[edit] see also[edit] notes[edit]"

Av,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Av,"av is an emuli thief on roshar who is hired by shalash. appearance and personality[edit] he has the characteristic dark skin and hair of the makabaki people. he is taller than his cousin baxil. av is a confident man who gets mildly annoyed by his jumpy, timid cousin. he carries a large sword in a sheath slung over his shoulder. he is somewhat surly, and maintains a nonchalant attitude in stressful situations. attributes and abilities[edit] av is presumably a relatively skilled thief, since shalash was willing to hire him. their small team is able to avoid detection even in heavily guarded buildings. he likely has some experience with swordfighting. history[edit] av and baxil were hired by shalash to assist her in infiltrating homes and palaces with the goal of destroying artwork, particularly artwork that depicted her. they were not aware of her true identity and simply referred to her as ""mistress""; they noticed that she did not seem to fit in with typical rosharan ethnicities, and av assumed that she was of mixed heritage. baxil was infatuated with her, but av simply saw her as a well-paying, if dangerous, employer. during the break-ins, shalash prohibited baxil and av from stealing anything. av primarily served as a lookout and a guard while baxil assisted shalash as she performed acts of vandalism. av and baxil helped shalash break into the palace of ashno of sages, who was said to be one of the richest and holiest men in emul. the pair may have also been present during shalash's destruction of artwork in other places, such as the bronze palace in azimir and king gavilar's palace in kholinar. av was knowledgeable regarding the boons and curses of the nightwatcher. his parents and several brothers had all visited the valley. av told baxil that the nightwatcher did not try to trick you or twist your words, despite rumors to that effect. she simply used the old magic to give you the boon that she felt you deserved, accompanied by a curse that could not be predicted. his family had generally regretted their visits, except his father. his father's boon had been valuable cloth that allowed the family to survive a lurnip famine; his curse was viewing the world upside-down, but he was able to get used to it. based on his family's experiences, av did not plan to visit the valley himself. notes[edit]"
Demid,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Demid,"""“ our ancestors left behind civilization, power, and might in order to secure freedom. i would not give that up, eshonai. ”- demid"" demid is a listener on roshar. he is a scholar in narak during the war of reckoning alongside his once-mate, venli, and later takes on stormform. appearance and personality[edit] as a scholar, demid wears nimbleform and has a gangly appearance. he later gains strength and agility by switching to stormform. demid is intelligent, curious, and thoughtful. he is willing to go to great lengths to defeat the humans, but he prefers to avoid unnecessary risk to his people. he is empathetic, and has a calming effect on those around him. even in stormform, he is not as quick to anger as his compatriots. attributes and abilities[edit] like other singers, demid can change his abilities by taking different spren into his gemheart. he has worn a number of forms. he becomes a scholar through the use of nimbleform and is able to read and write, although the form limits his physical capabilities. he is one of the first listeners to take on stormform, and becomes immediately comfortable wearing it. history[edit] demid and venli met in their youth and became friends. at some point, they took on mateform and became a couple, although they did not have any children. after they left mateform, they remained close; venli always felt that demid was someone she could rely on, and often confided in him. demid was part of venli's inner circle that first became aware of her research with ulim regarding lost listener forms, including forms of power, and he eagerly supported her. demid and venli took nimbleform after it was rediscovered and became research partners for around three years. demid was a consistent advocate for venli's views, as he was tired of war and wanted freedom for the listeners. he helped persuade eshonai that stormform was a weapon that needed to be utilized, and was present when the five chose her to test it. ""“our sacrifice was worthwhile. yes, we have lost many, but humans sought our extinction. at least this way some of our people survived, and now we have great power! ”-demid, after taking stormform"" after eshonai's successful transformation, demid also took on stormform. he devised a system for transformation that involved entering the highstorm after the initial stormwall had passed, as it was marginally safer. he participated in the battle of narak and believed that the sacrifice of some listeners was worth the power that they had gained by calling the everstorm. after the battle, demid was part of the group led by ulim that searched the chasms near narak for corpses, in particular eshonai's. he was the first to spot her body, and despite some serious cultural reservations about touching a corpse, he helped strip off her shardplate. ulim later selected demid and venli as two of the first nine listeners that would give up their bodies for the return of the fused. neither demid nor venli understood the consequences of this process. when the everstorm hit, demid died, and his body was taken over by hariel. hariel still resembled demid, but his appearance, voice, and posture changed. venli was shocked and upset when she realized that demid was gone, but quickly tried to rationalize their decision. relationships[edit] venli[edit] ""“she liked how he listened to what she said, and he always had a ready compliment. he'd enjoy sneaking about, and she’d feel braver with him along.”-venli's thoughts on demid"" demid and venli have a long history together. in their youth, venli often sought out demid to enjoy his company. he is complimentary and supportive, and has a way of making her feel confident. after their time together in mateform, they remain close, and work well as a ""researchpair"" of scholars. venli suppresses any lingering romantic feelings that she has for demid, but maintains a bond with him. demid remains loyal to venli, and is one of the few people who know of the key role that she plays in restoring the old forms to the listeners. at times, he worries about her ambition, but ultimately stands behind her. venli tries to convince herself that demid's death was a necessary sacrifice, although she does not feel right about it, suspecting that her envoyform is affecting her emotions. she later uses surgebinding to escape odium's influence, and realizes that she did love demid. she regrets not understanding her true feelings, and blames herself for his death. notes[edit]"
Varanis,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Varanis,"varanis is a listener lieutenant on the shattered plains of roshar. he serves under eshonai during the war of reckoning. attributes and abilities[edit] varanis seems to be one of eshonai's most trusted lieutenants. he is a disciplined, loyal soldier who typically wears warform. after the coming of the everstorm, he was one of the listeners selected by eshonai to wear stormform. history[edit] near the end of the war of reckoning, varanis was one of the soldiers tasked with creating paintings at the hall of art in stormseat in an attempt to attract creationspren and perhaps learn how to take artform. eshonai chuckled at his game attempts to paint flowers while wearing warform. after the coming of the everstorm and eshonai's transformation into stormform, she selected a very limited group of listeners to transform in the next storm, including venli, other scholars, and two hundred low-level soldiers. she intentionally excluded officers and soldiers from her own division, who might have questioned her. however, varanis was among the listeners that were scheduled for transformation in the next everstorm. when thude and a group of dissenters (including jaxlim) fled into the chasms, varanis reported their escape to eshonai, angering her. varanis presumably took on stormform alongside thousands of other listeners prior to the battle of narak and participated in the battle. rlain was acquainted with varanis and later mourned ""losing"" him along with eshonai, thude, and the other residents of narak. however, it is unclear if rlain believed that varanis was dead or if he was speaking of loss metaphorically. notes[edit]"
Devi,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Devi,"devi is a listener scout on the shattered plains of roshar. in late 1173, devi was the first member of eshonai's strike force to spot a chasmfiend chrysalis on the plains. after the parshendi won the gemheart, he was allowed to carry it back himself as a reward for being the first to see it. notes[edit]"
Song of Wars,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Song_of_Wars,"the song of wars is one of the songs detailing the oral history of the listeners. it was likely one of the songs written by the last legion in order to keep their memories alive. it has at least fifty-five stanzas, and it presumably details the history of various listener wars. notably, the song states that the shattered plains were not created by the listener gods, the fused. it also indicates that written records with more information about the shattering once existed, but they have since been lost. excerpts[edit] ""“they blame our peoplefor the loss of that landthe city that once covered itdid range the eastern strand.the power made known in the tomes of our clanour gods were not who shattered these plains. ”-55th stanza"" notes[edit]"
Song of the Fallen,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Song_of_the_Fallen,the song of the fallen is a listener song for dead heroes. it appears to be some form of a funerary ritual; rlain sings it upon finding teft's dead body. notes[edit]
Song of Spren,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Song_of_Spren,"the song of spren is one of songs detailing the oral history of the listeners. it discusses spren, surges, and the relationship between those and the listeners. excerpts[edit] ""“the spren betrayed us, it's often felt.our minds are too close to their realmthat gives us our forms, but more is thendemanded by the smartest spren,we can't provide what the humans lend,though broth are we, their meat is men. ”-9th stanza"" ""“but it is not impossible to blendtheir surges to ours in the end.it has been promised and it can come.or do we understand the sum?we questioned not if they can have us then,but if we dare to have them again. ”-10th stanza"" notes[edit]"

Song of Mornings,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Song_of_Mornings,"the song of mornings is a listener song. it is simple, and is meant to train young children for more complex rhythms and songs. venli finds it satisfying, because since it is simple, you can add complexity to it, and sing the song's soul instead of just worrying about getting its lyrics and notes right. it is jaxlim's favorite song. history[edit] after a heated discussion between eshonai and venli, they hummed to the rhythm of reconciliation, then to longing, then to joy. as eshonai hummed, venli sang the song of mornings, a reminder of a simpler time in their relationship. although it was dusk, the song worked with the situation. after encountering the listeners that had fled narak, venli sang the song of mornings to encourage jaxlim to remember who she was; jaxlim had lost her mental faculties and volition is required to bond a lightspren and become a knight radiant. it worked, and jaxlim recovered her memories. trivia[edit] - is called ""song of mornings"". notes[edit]"
Song of Making Paper,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Song_of_Making_Paper,"the song of making paper is a listener song that describes the process of making paper. the listeners make paper from dried rockbud pulp following a harvest. few among all the listener families know the song, jaxlim being one of them. as a result, paper is precious and rare among the listeners. with the song, jaxlim helps eshonai perfect the process of making paper. notes[edit]"
Davim,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Davim,"""“ we must be unified in this decision. i will accept nothing else. ”- davim about taking on stormform"" davim is a member of the listener council of five in narak during the war of reckoning on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] davim wears workform, representing it in the council of five. he's broad-faced, with skin that is mostly black with some red swirls. he is somewhat impatient, seeking to obtain the ability to use stormform regardless of the dangers that it might pose. nonetheless, he is reasonable and relatively careful, and acknowledges that the council needs to be unified given the possible dangers of the new form. after seeing the changes in eshonai, he's still eager to use it, and becomes tempted by the power that the form bestows. history[edit] at some point during the war of reckoning, davim was chosen for the council of five and joined it in workform. after venli proposed the plan of taking on stormform, he was eager to try it out. nonetheless, he sided with eshonai in saying that she should be the one to perform the test, as venli was too important to lose. he was also concerned about the possibility of eshonai herself dying, pointing out that she was their last remaining shardbearer. after eshonai was taken over by stormform, davim was initially angry with her for not sharing her plans with the rest of the five, then cautious about her proposed plan to transform the entire listener population. later, he inquired about how the new form felt, and became far more interested in taking it on when he heard the answer. he intended to speak with eshonai further about the topic out of earshot of other members of the five, and she believed he was already on her side. his attitude implied that he planned to wear stormform himself, but whether he did so is unknown. notes[edit]"
Chivi,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Chivi,"""“ i do not like the look of those who have taken this form. i do not like how people clamor to be given it. ”- chivi, on stormform"" chivi is a member of the listener council of five in narak during the war of reckoning on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] chivi wears nimbleform, representing it in the council of five. nimbleform gives her face elongated features, with long hair strands that she ties into a ponytail. she is frustrated by the complacency of the listeners, and does not initially oppose using stormform. history[edit] chivi was present at the council meeting when venli proposed the plan of taking on stormform. she was unhappy with the decline of the listeners and appeared to be hopeful that they could find a way to turn the tide in their battle against the humans. she agreed with eshonai's plan to be the one to test the new form, as venli was considered too important to lose. after eshonai took on stormform and transformed two hundred additional soldiers to create the storm division, chivi assumed that this would be enough to help the listeners win the war. she was not initially in favor of eshonai's proposed plan to transform the entire listener population, and expressed some concerns about how far the plan had already progressed, noting that other listeners were now coveting the form. eshonai was insistent, but chivi and zuln did not allow the plan to proceed. eshonai and venli later conferred and believed that they could convince chivi to join them. it is not clear what happened to chivi after eshonai led a coup to take control of the listeners. she either took on stormform or was one of the dissenters that escaped into the chasms. notes[edit]"
Abronai,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Abronai,"""“this is outrageous! the dictates of the five rule us, not the will of a single person! can't you see that the form, the new form is overriding her! you've all lost your minds! or...or worse. ”-abronai on eshonai's coup"" abronai is a parshendi man who serves on the parshendi ruling council, the council of five on narak in 1173. appearance & personality[edit] ""“red eyes. have we come to this? ”-abronai on stormform"" as abronai represents the interests of the mates in the five, he took mateform. in private conversations with eshonai, abronai expresses distaste for the form and a desire to switch to another. abronai appeares plump and lush, like all mates, however he maintains better control over himself than others in mateform. abronai wishes that peace could have been reached with the humans when eshonai meets with adolin kholin in the guise of dalinar. however, he cares for his people more, and despite his fears of stormform he initially supports the idea of converting all of the parshendi into the new form. however, once the changes it has wrought on eshonai become clearer, abronai is strongly opposed to the idea. history[edit] when the discovery of stormform was put before the five, abronai supported eshonai in her proposal that she be the first to take on the new form. he believed that since the spren had again returned to grant mankind the ancient powers of surgebinding, as eshonai witnessed in kaladin, that the parshendi also needed to reach for their forms of power. when eshonai returned praising the benefits of stormform, abronai initially agreed that they should have their people take stormform en masse. however, due to eshonai's new harsh and cruel personality and zuln's objections, he became uncertain. abronai was also still offput by the red eyes of stormform and skeptical about whether it could truly summon a highstorm. after eshonai's words stirred the parshendi people into rebellion, abronai was taken into custody with all the other parshendi who refused to take stormform. he likely escaped with thude and the rest of the dissenters into the chasms of the shattered plains. notes[edit]"

Drying Sea,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Drying_Sea,"the drying sea is a sea on roshar. where precisely it is located is unknown, it is about two weeks march from the valley south of the shattered plains where dalinar kholin met the parshendi for the first time. notes[edit]"
Song of Listing,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Song_of_Listing,"the song of listing is one of the songs detailing the oral history of the listeners on roshar. it recounts many of the common forms that listeners were once able to take. it is not known to mention any of the ""forms of power"" granted by bonding a voidspren, which are covered by other songs such as the song of secrets. the song has at least 91 stanzas, and eshonai notes that the old songs recount ""hundreds"" of forms. the song of listing was presumably written by the last legion to ensure that they remembered these forms, as they were only able to use dullform and mateform after they abandoned their gods. around 1166, a young eshonai had not learned the song. jaxlim had trouble reciting it due to her increasing problems with memory loss, and venli tried to help her remember. by the time of the war of reckoning, the listeners had rediscovered nimbleform, warform, and workform after generations of research. scholars continued to research the secrets to unlocking other forms known from the song such as artform and mediationform. with the advent of the true desolation, the listeners regained access to forms that had been abandoned. the singers who had previously been enslaved as the parsh were given at least a dozen options of forms after they were freed, and use various forms including artform and scholarform. excerpts[edit] notes[edit]"
Stormseat,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Hall_of_Art,"""“they blame our peoplefor the loss of that land.the city that once covered it did range the eastern strand. ”-song of wars, 55th stanza"" stormseat was the capital city of the historic silver kingdom of natanatan on roshar. during the war of reckoning, it's called narak, or exile, and serves as the home of the listeners. geography[edit] stormseat is located in the southeastern roshar, in the lands that are mostly unclaimed by anyone in the era of solitude. ancient maps placed it in the center of the unclaimed hills, and modern scholars tend to agree with them, citing the fact that the characteristic domes that can be found on the shattered plains are missing in illustrations of stormseat. in reality, the city sits in the very center of the plains, surrounded by numerous plateaus and chasms that make reaching it extremely difficult. its location makes it highly exposed to highstorms at their near-full power, which may be where the name stormseat came from. layout[edit] ""“ruins of ruins, one might call them. the works of men and listeners alike did not last long before the might of the highstorms. ”-eshonai on narak "" little is known of the appearance of ancient stormseat. although the song of wars claims that the city ""covered"" the shattered plains, the surviving images of it paint it as rather small, though it likely had numerous outbuildings and satelite towns. within the city itself, several landmarks could be distinguished, among them a tall tower in the very centre and the dais housing the city's oathgate to the south-west of it. it's known that stormseat had a temple dedicated to the herald chana, with a large mosaic on its leeward side. if stormseat was similar to other major cities of its era, like kholinar and thaylen, it's possible every herald had a temple of their own within its walls. in the present day, the city is split between numerous plateaus, the largest of which is home to the listeners. it encompasses the plaza that houses the ancient tower, as well as the buildings surrounding it. of its stuctures, the tower is by far the best-preserved, as centuries of highstorms have toppled most of the city and covered it in crem. while the original purpose of some buildings can still be guessed at, oftentimes the ancient houses and halls are utterly unrecognizable as works of people. though numerous structures have been completely filled in with crem and rocks, just as many remain empty within, hiding what remains of stormseat's once-great past - remnants of its inhabitants, rotten furniture and even rusted door hinges. the air within is humid, and musty with age. rather than excavating stormseat, the listeners constructed their own settlement atop the city's bones. the rocky shelves have been transformed into barracks and homes, while carapaces of greatshells form ramshackle houses. inside, crem is used to create divisions and make separate rooms, with additional layer on the outer walls to provide insulation and stability. mounds of former buildings serve as rockbud farms, while many houses grow shalebark on the outside. both the homes and the farms are built in the shadows of the older structures, to protect them from highstorms. this does not make them completely protected, however. as the highstorm arrives, the listeners stuff rags under the doors, set up support beams to prop up the walls, and close up the windows, hammering in large blocks of wood to secure them. following the battle of narak, the city has been taken over by humans, who turn it into a fortress to protect oathgate to urithiru and the route between it and the warcamps. the tower is repurposed into a lookout, and the buildings become barracks. the surrounding plateaus serve as training grounds for the windrunner squires and assembly points.. they are connected to each other and narak by old bridges from gemheart hunts, though plans are made to replace those with permanent structures. notable landmarks[edit] the oathgate[edit] the natanatan oathgate is located in stormseat. the platform survived the shattering of the plains intact and splintered off completely from the surrounding land in defiance of the pattern that governs the shape of the plateaus, suggesting that it's made of a sturdier material than the rest of the city. though by now, the dais is buried in crem, it has retained its former shape near-perfectly. inside, the control chamber has been preserved exceptionally well, with colorful mosaics on the walls and the floor retaining their hue and the lanterns around its circumference still whole. despite the added mass on top, the oathgate remains functional. when listeners live in narak, the plateau is used as practice ground by their soldiers. afterwards, it's restored to its former function, and a ramp is constructed to allow wagons and chulls to climb onto it. one of the knights radiant is on standby either there or at the matching oathgate in urithiru most of the time to operate it. the tower[edit] the tower is one of the few structures that can be found both in ancient stormseat and modern narak, although its appearance has changed during that time. over the centuries, it has turned into a spire akin to a stalagmite, with the space inside clogged up by dried-up crem. nonetheless, it remains standing despite being exposed to the elements for centuries. to return the tower to a semblance of its prior functionality, the listeners carved steps into its outer side and added a railing to prevent people from falling off. the very top of it has been flattened, and became the meeting spot for the council of five that rules the listeners. despite this accomodation, the climb is noted as difficult for listeners with physically-weaker forms. after humans reclaim stormseat, the top of the tower becomes a watchpost to warn about approaching voidbringer attacks. the hall of art[edit] a long pavilion near the center of narak serves as the hall of art. it has walls covered with crem and numerous alcoves one can hide in, as well as a small pedestal in the center for models and references. to let in as much sunlight as possible, there is no ceiling. it is there that the listeners of various forms attempt to create artwork in hopes of attracting creationspren and unlocking artform. after humans begin to repurpose narak into a fortress, they find the hall of art and the abandoned works it contains. while they note the paintings as interesting, it's uncertain whether they do anything about them or attempt to use the room for something else. the watering square[edit] outside the hall of art sits a watering square. there, a pool has been sculpted out of clay by nimbleforms to collect highstorm water for drinking. despite the fact that it's the main source of water for the whole city, the mateforms sometimes bathe there, although that is heavily discouraged. it's likely the square still serves its former purpose now that stormseat is controlled by humans. history[edit] ancient stormseat[edit] as with many of roshar's oldest settlements, it's uncertain when stormseat was built. during the heraldic epochs, it served as the capital of natanatan, and one of the ten cities with an oathgate that connected it to the knights radiant headquarters, urithiru. the area around it was densely occupied, with numerous outbuildings and settlements surrounding the city. at some point, stormseat was destroyed by the same event that transformed the natan interior into the shattered plains. there is some disagreement as to when this happened. human sources place the destruction of stormseat at aharietiam, the last of the old desolations. listeners, however, put it significantly earlier, as according to their stories, by the time the last legion was sent into the area, the shattered plains already existed. whichever is the case, humans blamed the destruction on the listener gods (either the fused or the unmade), though the song of wars is confident that this wasn't their doing. the listeners point to stormseat as the place where they broke their ties to odium. the name narak, meaning ""exile"" in their language, refers partially to this event. following the destruction, stormseat wasn't rebuilt, but rather left to crumble. over time, the nation of natanatan fell apart, until only a single coastal city, new natanan, claims descendancy from it. it is perhaps for this reason that when urithiru was abandoned prior to the recreance and all the other oathgates were locked from both sides, the one in stormseat remained accessible. war of reckoning[edit] though listeners have lived on the shattered plains since before the aharietiam, they made their home at the collapsed domes near the plains' outer edge. it was only following the assassination of the alethi king, gavilar kholin, that they moved to narak, as its remote location made it a better defensive position. over the next five years, the listeners transformed narak into a functioning city, building on top of the old structures. though they might've been more spread out at the start, by the end of the war of reckoning, their entire nation lived there. it was during the war that jasnah kholin began her research into urithiru. eventually, she pinpointed stormseat as a possible access point into the city, and though she seemingly perished in the attack on her ship, her ward shallan davar continued her work. eventually, shallan managed to find the rough location of stormseat and convinced dalinar kholin to organize an expedition to find it, and the oathgate it held. as the alethi pushed towards narak, the listeners there were transforming into stormform, while the children, the elderly and those who refused to change abandoned the city for the dubious safety of the plains further east. eventually, the stormforms and the alethi clashed over narak and the surrounding plateaus. though the listeners were defeated, it was not before they managed to summon the everstorm, and shallan had to rescue the alethi armies by reactivating the oathgate. true desolation[edit] the surviving stormform listeners did not return to narak after the arrival of the everstorm. rather, they searched the surrounding chasms for anything of note, and then left for more distant plateaus, where most of them gave up their bodies for the fused. likewise, those who hadn't taken the stormform didn't come back to the city, but instead made their way further east, into the floodplains at the very edge of the shattered plains. in the listeners' absence, the alethi claimed narak for themselves. in the following days, eight of their ten armies travelled through there on their way to urithiru. later, they began to turn the city into a fortress, both to protect the oathgate and to secure the route between it and the warcamps. many of narak's structures were repurposed - houses became barracks, and the tower of the five was turned into a watchpost. groups of windrunner squires and squire hopefuls, as well as regular soldiers, would often practice on the surrounding plateaus. however, dalinar worried whether the city afforded sufficient protection to the long road between the camps and the oathgate. the new natanan ambassador to alethkar, au-nak, attempted to have control of stormseat returned to his people, claiming that it was their birthright as the heirs to natanatan. however, this hasn't been given much consideration thus far. politics[edit] as one of the ten cities on roshar to have an oathgate, stormseat held a great deal of power during the heraldic epochs. the city was well-known in its time even across the world, as images and mosaics of it can be found as far west as azir. during the true desolation, its importance is even greater, as rather than ten oathgates, humans opposed to odium hold only four. narak grants immediate access to the shattered plains and the warcamps that are among the last of the free alethi territories, as well as the various cities of eastern frostlands, among them new natanan. during the war of reckoning, the city is ruled by the

Vedenar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Vedenar,"""“ vedenar, one of the great cities of the world, was now little more than a heap of rubble and ash. ”- taravangian"" vedenar is the capital city of jah keved on roshar. geography and layout[edit] vedenar lies on the southern edge of jah keved, on the cliffs facing tarat sea. the sound of the waves crashing against the stone can be heard across the entire city. to the west of vedenar flows an unnamed river stemming from the horneater peaks, while to the north lay the vast fields that feed its populace. vedenar's ancient center is laid out in the shape of a hexagon, with its main thoroughfares forming a rotationally symmetrical pattern that was likely created through cymatics. it's likely that the city has grown beyond that since the heraldic epochs. vedenar is known for its lush atmosphere and many amazing gardens. most of the city is overgrown with greenery, with rare plants jumbled together wherever there's any space for them to grow. the most magnificent gardens sit atop vast, plate-like terraces that jut out above the city. unfortunately, following the veden civil war, swathes of the city have been destroyed. many buildings and terrace gardens have been reduced to heaps of rubble by siege equipment, while others have burned down to cinders. the destruction is uneven -- many veden live in houses that remain well-preserved even as the neighboring buildings lay razed to the ground. even months after the war's conclusion, the smell of smoke still lingers in the air. notable locations[edit] history[edit] vedenar is one of the dawncities, the oldest settlements in all of roshar. back during the heraldic epochs, it lay in the silver kingdom of valhav, and, having an oathgate, was presumably its capital. shortly before the recreance, it was known as veden city. in the late era of solitude, vedenar was well-known worldwide as one of the greatest cities on the planet. however, the diagram sought to destabilize the country so as to give taravangian an opening to take it over. for this reason, they sent szeth to vedenar to assassinate king hanavanar, his son and the highprinces, plunging jah keved into civil war. the forces led by highprince valam took over vedenar. the other highprinces soon followed after him, and the city fell into a months-long siege later termed the battle of vedenar. the siege was excessively brutal, owing to the veden soldiers being pushed forward by the thrill into combat past all reason. many forces continued fighting even after suffering over fifty percent losses. in one battle, one of the armies pushed another off the city's cliffs and onto the ridge that protected the port from the highstorms. the civil war eventually wound down, with valam emerging victorious. however, he was extremely ill, and it was at this time that taravangian arrived, bringing medical supplies and food. as he had a claim to the throne through his mother, valam passed the crown onto him before ordering his own son, redin, to kill him. after being crowned, taravangian set out to improve the living conditions in vedenar. the bodies of the fallen were collected and burned down in the fields outside the walls. the soldiers were folded under taravangian's command and moved into the stormshelters within the city. after dalinar reached out to the king, malata opened the local oathgate, reconnecting vedenar with urithiru. some of the alethi troops were stationed there to aid in defending and rebuilding the city. it was while visiting vedenar that dalinar was pronounced a heretic and excommunicated from the vorin church. later, after it was revealed that rather than vedenar, the voidbringers sought to attack thaylen city, some of the alethi battalions there were withdrawn, but a number remained in case of a surprise attack. politics[edit] as the capital of jah keved, vedenar is the most important city in the whole country. the veden government, as well as the king and his family, live there. the highprinces spend a lot of their time in vedenar rather than in their own lands. various lesser nobles, such as lin davar, also visit it quite often. redin works from there as an investigator for highprince valam. the city is also important as a transport hub. when active, its oathgate allows it access to ten other locations across roshar, including urithiru. it's also an important sea port connecting the country with other states along the shore. its large size and good connections make it a perfect place to disappear in. whoever controls vedenar, controls jah keved -- it is for this reason that during the civil war, all the veden highprinces brought their armies here. the battle of vedenar was the most bloody conflict of the civil war largely becase every faction knew the city's value. notes[edit]"

Neturo-son-Vallano,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Neturo,"""“the best and truest duty of a person is to add to the world. to create, and not destroy. ”-neturo-son-vallano, as remembered by szeth"" neturo-son-vallano is a shin man on roshar and the father of szeth. he was the bearer of ishar's honorblade until his death. appearance and personality[edit] neturo-son-vallano is ethnically shin, meaning he is likely lighter-skinned and shorter than other rosharans and that his eyes lack an epicanthic fold. as an assigned guardian of an honorblade, he is presumably a follower of stone shamanism. he believes the greatest service a man can perform is to create, to add to the universe, and therefore was unhappy with being forced to kill, to subtract. attributes and abilities[edit] neturo-son-vallano has likely trained with all of the surges granted by the honorblades in shinovar's possession. while bearing ishar's honorblade, he presumably had access to the surges of tension and adhesion and was an expert in using them. these are the same surges used by the radiant order of bondsmiths, but the surgebinding granted by honorblades typically differs from surgebinding granted by a nahel bond. however, szeth specifically refers to neturo's sword as the ""bondsmith honorblade"" and the stormfather implies that ishar's recovery of the honorblade was related to his apparent ability to use bondsmith powers. it is not known if ishar's blade can grant other users such as neturo access to the more esoteric, bondsmith-specific uses of the surges. history[edit] neturo-son-vallano worked as a shepherd on the coast of shinovar during szeth's youth. there were white cliffs near their home. at some point, their family was given to the honorblades through unknown circumstances. neturo became the bearer of ishar's honorblade, and was forced to learn how to kill. szeth trained with the honorblades in his youth and eventually wielded jezrien's blade, but it is unclear when he received his blade as compared to neturo. ""“your father was barely a man when i found him. the shin had accepted the unmade. tried to make gods of them. i saved them. and your father did give me this blade. he thanked me for letting him die.”-ishar, to szeth"" during the true desolation, ishar took over tukar and other parts of southern roshar and waged war against the coalition of monarchs. dalinar attempted to track ishar down to parley, eventually finding him at a small camp near the coast. ishar revealed that he had reclaimed his honorblade from shinovar, stating that the shin served the heralds and had simply been holding the sword for him. szeth told ishar that neturo-son-vallano and the other shin kept secrets for the heralds, but had no plans to return the honorblades to them. ishar discounted this idea and told szeth that the shin had accepted the unmade as their gods before he saved them. he said that he did not kill szeth's father; rather, neturo willingly gave up his blade and welcomed the chance to die. ishar's insanity casts doubt on his version of events, but neturo did in fact lose possession of the honorblade. szeth did not want to believe ishar, and was deeply shaken. upon recovering, he drew nightblood for the first time in a year to strike at ishar. prior to the encounter with ishar, taravangian mentioned neturo-son-vallano's death to szeth, who did not take him seriously since he knew the old king was trying to manipulate him. when szeth saw ishar with the blade, it seemingly confirmed his father's fate. enraged, szeth found taravangian and demanded that he reveal how he had known that neturo was dead. however, on that day taravangian was too stupid to answer before szeth killed him; it remains unclear how or when taravangian actually learned of neturo's death. relationships[edit] szeth[edit] szeth greatly respected his father and considered him a gentle, wise man. when szeth became truthless, he stopped thinking of himself as ""szeth-son-neturo"" to avoid besmirching his father's name, instead using his grandfather's name; he even tried to stop thinking about neturo entirely. neturo also had a partner and a daughter, but nothing is known about them. trivia[edit] - an early concept of the character that became neturo is briefly mentioned in - when jek (the prototype for szeth) notes that he is skilled in the art of stealth killing due to extensive training with his father. notes[edit]"

Heb,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Heb,"""“this is my husband heb, good knight. he's never seen a sword, far as i know. ”-taffa"" heb was a man who lived on roshar during the eighth heraldic epoch. he was married to taffa and they had a daughter, seeli. he was the person dalinar (and, later, fen) replaced in the starfalls vision. history[edit] heb lived with his family during a time of relative peace between desolations, in a small village in natanatan. he might've been a farmer, as he owned both a house and an adjacent barn. in the year three thirty seven of the eight epoch, his village was attacked by midnight essence. he and his wife were separated from their daughter, and taffa sent him to look for her. he finally managed to locate her in the barn, though at this point, they were surrounded by the midnight essence. as the starfalls vision begins there, it's difficult to determine what happens to him after this point. in dalinar's version of the vision, where he controls heb, he manages to fight off the midnight essence and gets his family to flee the house, running towards a nearby river. on their way there, they're ambushed by the midnight essence, but before it can kill them, they're rescued by the starfalls windrunner and his companion. the two knights radiant then offer to take heb to urithiru to train him properly in the arts of war. in fen's version of the vision, heb abandons seeli and taffa and runs away to organize a resistance against the midnight essence in the town. the group he puts together is fairly successful, and manages to hold out until the radiants arrive to assist them, whereupon the vision is interrupted so that dalinar can speak with fen. it's difficult to say what happened in reality. considering that heb was a civillian who, according to taffa, has never held a sword in his life, it's very likely he died when the midnight essence attacked the barn he was in. notes[edit]"
Seeli,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Seeli,"""“ father. father, what is happening? ”- seeli"" seeli was a young girl who lived on roshar during the eighth heraldic epoch. she was the daughter of taffa and heb, the man whom dalinar and fen replaced in the starfalls vision. history[edit] seeli lived with her parents in a small village in natanatan during a time between desolations. when she was roughly seven or eight years old, her home town was assaulted by the midnight essence. she hid from the attack in her family's barn, where her father later found her. this is when the starfalls vision begins, making her subsequent fate uncertain. in dalinar's version of the vision, she and heb manage to get her out of the barn and into the house, whereupon they and taffa leave to run away and hide from the creatures. seeli is terrified the entire time, but manages to survive when two knights radiant arrive to rescue the family. in fen's version of the vision, heb abandons her, and seeli witnesses her mother's death. she herself makes it through the battle, though she is heavily traumatized, and can be found huddling near the fire with other surviving children. when fen-as-heb approaches her, almighty uses seeli to give his message. in reality, it's highly likely she died when the midnight essence attacked the barn. notes[edit]"

""“aw, damnation. ”-bashin, as a chasmfiend attacks"" the chull that was towing the bait began to act erratically, and the chasmfiend appeared earlier than expected. instead of attacking the hunting plateau, it attacked the viewing plateau, eating a chull and injuring multiple people. the shardbearers quickly responded and elhokar was able to kill the chasmfiend and claim its gemheart. dalinar's assault[edit] ""“sir... you need to see this. something has changed. ”-bashin to dalinar, after discovering a singer in stormform"" in 1173, bashin joined dalinar's offensive into the shattered plains. he coordinated teams scouting the plateaus prior to the battle of narak, reporting on sightings of the parshendi to dalinar. his scouts managed to kill a singer in stormform, and he showed dalinar and shallan the corpse, realizing that it may have been a significant development. he was confused by the burn marks on the bodies of some dead alethi scouts, as he was not aware that singers could control lightning in stormform. urithiru[edit] bashin lived in urithiru after the coming of the everstorm. he oversaw axehound kennels in the kholin sections of the tower, even though axehounds were no longer used for hunting. bashin retired from his duties at some point after he moved to the tower. he gave his prized floppy hat to felt. notes[edit]"

Vengeance,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Vengeance,"vengeance is a horse belonging to king elhokar kholin of alethkar on roshar. he is not a ryshadium but is of the finest shin stock. elhokar rode vengeance on a chasmfiend hunt on the shattered plains with dalinar kholin and his sons during the war of reckoning. fin, one of the king's grooms, prepared the horse beforehand, saddling him with elhokar's favorite saddle and getting him ready; as the head groom then led vengeance to dalinar's camp, fin saw that someone had switched out the saddle with a different one. vengeance was checked over by dalinar's grooms before they left on the hunt. the horse was initially difficult to get under control when the chasmfiend arrived, but elhokar was able to charge the beast and get in a few attacks. he wheeled vengeance about sharply at one point, and the saddle strap broke, flinging elhokar to the ground. this incident fueled elhokar's paranoia, prompting an investigation into whether or not the girth strap was deliberately cut. notes[edit]"
Gallant,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Gallant,"gallant is dalinar kholin's ryshadium steed on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] gallant is a ""full"" (presumably purebred) ryshadium. he resembles an ordinary horse, but is approximately two hands (8 inches) taller than a typical stallion. even the largest normal horses look like ponies next to him. he has the ideal build for a warhorse, and is more squat and robust than other ryshadium. he has a black coat and blue eyes with rectangular pupils.[fn 1] like other ryshadium, gallant has a spren bond that makes him self-aware to the point of near-sapience. gallant chose his rider, dalinar kholin, and they have a special relationship. dalinar is the only person that gallant will allow to ride him, although he once grudgingly allowed adolin to ride him temporarily at dalinar's request. adolin felt very strange riding gallant in lieu of his own ryshadium, sureblood, and believed that if a battle broke out, gallant would immediately throw him and seek to protect dalinar. dalinar is able to recognize various complex emotions in the animal's features, such as shame and pride, and gallant is very attentive towards dalinar. gallant has a strong sense of responsibility toward his rider and a good understanding of the warcamp's routines: he once kicked his stall door down and went alone to the staging area for dalinar's army when a groom was too slow at getting him ready for battle. gallant's intelligence means that he generally does not really need a groom at all, and he displays annoyance when inexperienced people try to lead him. adolin also believes that he likes to show off. he enjoys crispmelons and sugar lumps as treats. attributes and abilities[edit] gallant is the ideal warhorse for a knight radiant. he is incredibly strong and is not bothered by someone in full shardplate jumping onto him, which can sometimes break the back of an ordinary horse. he is exceptionally fast even when carrying a rider in plate and is seen carrying three wounded men from the battlefield with ease. his bond with dalinar allows them to work together seamlessly in battle, and dalinar can direct gallant with his knees while he wields his shardblade. gallant is intelligent, fearless, and loyal, and appears to have excellent stamina. he also has stone hooves, which are presumably far more durable than ordinary hooves and do not need to be shoed. history[edit] it is not known exactly when gallant first met dalinar, but it was presumably at some point after the razing of rathalas circa 1163, when dalinar was still riding a conventional horse. by the time of the war of reckoning, gallant and dalinar almost always rode into battles and chasmfiend hunts together. gallant was one of only twelve ryshadium in the warcamps at the shattered plains, and merely seeing him could inspire the soldiers of the kholin army. dalinar would often begin battles wielding oathbringer from atop gallant, then dismount when he believed that gallant could be in danger from close-quartered fighting. dalinar was riding gallant during the chasmfiend hunt when elhokar had a problem with his saddle and fell off of his horse. when dalinar quickly tried to come to elhokar's aid, the chasmfiend's tail slammed into gallant and dalinar was thrown to the ground. despite the direct hit, gallant suffered relatively minor injuries, and recovered quickly. he seemed to feel that he had failed dalinar, but dalinar was able to speak to him and convince him that he did nothing wrong and still deserved extra feed, which gallant would have otherwise turned down. gallant was also present at the battle of the tower. dalinar rode into battle on gallant, and gallant later helped evacuate wounded soldiers. near the end of the battle, a riderless gallant somehow appeared near the area where dalinar was dueling eshonai even though he was supposed to be on another plateau. gallant appeared to want to help dalinar, but was held back by parshendi soldiers. gallant moved with dalinar to urithiru after the battle of narak. he was given his own large field in the kholin section of the tower despite cramped quarters for other animals. gallant seemed to be kind to adolin while he was mourning sureblood, although that kindness did not extend to allowing adolin to ride him. dalinar became busy with his duties with the coalition of monarchs, and didn’t have much time to spend riding gallant. adolin began taking care of gallant and partially bonding to him, and they formed some trust. adolin was grateful to gallant for that, though gallant still missed dalinar. gallant joined the delegation to lasting integrity with adolin, carrying much of adolin’s gear, including a variety of weaponry. he let mayalaran ride on him, and was extra gentle with her. adolin was comforted that maya was with gallant, trusting the horse to take care of her. gallant seemed to instictively know what adolin needed from him as without explicit signal he galloped towards a running adolin to rescue notum. when adolin was rescuing notum, gallant helped somewhat by distracting the tukari soldiers when he charged into the battle, snorting. notes[edit]"
Truthless,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Oathstone,"""“i am truthless. i do as my master requires, and i do not ask for an explanation. ”-szeth, regarding his oath"" the truthless are the lowest social class among the people of shinovar. the underlying meaning of the word ""truthless"" is similar to ""liar"", but not quite the same. a truthless is a slave to anyone who holds their oathstone; rather than being bound by the tenets of their faith, they are obligated to obey the commands of their master in all things except for taking their own life and, in the case of szeth-son-son-vallano, giving up his honorblade. most outsiders consider truthless highly valuable due to their great obedience, but they are considered worthless by the shin, who cannot accept any payment for a truthless, even if it is pressed upon them. being named truthless is used as a terrible punishment by the shin. truthless have to bear the guilt of all the deeds that they are commanded to do -- even though they must obey their masters, they are not absolved of the guilt of their actions, as outsiders commonly believe they are. being prohibited from taking their own lives is part of the punishment as well, as it helps extend their suffering as long as possible. the concept of the truthless likely originates in the beliefs of stone shamanism: szeth avoids questioning the tenets of stone shamanism out of fear that that would lead him to question his status as truthless. becoming truthless[edit] the leaders of the shin can name someone truthless as punishment for a fundamental betrayal of their people. szeth is named truthless after making a claim that the voidbringers and knights radiant will return to roshar, which the leaders of the shin consider to be a dangerous lie. he is also equipped with jezrien's honorblade, though that is a special case and not usually done. while he is truthless, the stone shamans of shinovar intend to come reclaim his blade after he dies. when szeth discovers that the claim for which he was called a liar and made truthless is actually true, he begins to think of himself as never having been truthless at all and stops following the rules accordingly. this may indicate that it is generally possible to have one's truthless status retracted, though that is not certain, given that he makes that decision unilaterally and is in a somewhat unstable mental state by that time. oathstones[edit] each truthless has an oathstone assigned to them; whoever holds it becomes their master and the truthless is required to strictly obey their orders. despite the absoluteness with which szeth obeys his masters, oathstones have no magic properties; it is solely a sense of honor that holds truthless to their orders. szeth's oathstone is a plain chunk of rock, about the size of a sphere, that contains embedded quartz crystals and a visible iron vein. when taravangian wanted to bait szeth, he requested a stone that was perfectly round and smooth with a vein of quartz; szeth immediately identified this as a potential oathstone. when a truthless knows that their oathstone is unheld, they are required to retrieve it and then stand quietly in place until someone interacts with them. if their oathstone were destroyed, a truthless might try to put the pieces back together, switch their devotion to the object that destroyed it, or return to shinovar to get a new one; if a person consumed it, they might treat that person as their master. shin warriors are traded by means of stones that are very similar to oathstones. notes[edit]"
Avado,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Avado,"avado is a non-alethi merchant on roshar during the era of solitude. appearance and personality[edit] nothing is known of avado's appearance. he is a clever man and a skilled enough merchant to anticipate potential changes in the trade markets due to the assassination of the king. he is also a kind man, friendly enough to inquire after strangers standing by the side of the road. history[edit] shortly after king gavilar kholin's assassination by szeth, avado realized that the alethi might mistreat foreigners. he decided to leave alethkar for a friendlier trade environment in jah keved. avado noticed szeth standing by the side of the road, having retrieved his oathstone from where the parshendi had discarded it, and inquired about the shin man. szeth was then forced to explain his nature as truthless and give the oathstone to avado. the two traveled together to jah keved, avado unaware that he was harboring the king's assassin. notes[edit]"
Amark,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Amark,"amark is a bavlander and a member of bridge four on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] he is described as ""sniffly"" and speaks with a strong bav accent. when he lives in bavland, he wears the grimy clothing typical of mineworkers. he exhibits empathy, as he is upset by took commanding szeth to harm himself. history[edit] amark lived in the town of ironsway in bavland and presumably worked as a miner alongside ton. he and ton drank together in a run-down tavern with other miners, listening to took tell fictionalized stories about his life and showing off his truthless, szeth. when took ordered szeth to cut himself, amark protested, and became even more upset when took told szeth to slit his own throat. during the war of reckoning, he became a bridgeman for torol sadeas's army on the shattered plains under unknown circumstances, and he was assigned to bridge four. once kaladin made the decision to save bridge four, he drastically reduced the casualties that they suffered on bridge runs, but they still lost amark and koolf. kaladin later thought of amark and other people that he was unable to save after maps was killed. notes[edit]"

Jushu Davar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Jushu_Davar,"asha jushu davar is a lighteyed veden on roshar. he is the fourth son of brightness davar and lin davar. his siblings are helaran, balat, his older twin wikim, and shallan. appearance and personality[edit] jushu is lighteyed and presumably has the characteristic red hair of the davar family. he grows rather plump during his periods of living in excess; he is known to drink a lot of wine. he has scars on both wrists. he shares some resemblance to his twin brother wikim, but they would not be mistaken for one another. although they both have sunken eyes, wikim is noticeably thinner than jushu. jushu also wears his hair longer than wikim and looks older than his twin. jushu loses some weight during the veden civil war, but he retains the same complexion and still looks much different than wikim. in urithiru, jushu grows a beard, further differentiating himself from his twin. jushu was a happy, smiling child, and as he grew up he remained quicker to laugh than his twin. even in his darkest moments, he will engage in gallows humor with shallan as a coping mechanism. jushu has problems with addiction; balat believes he was driven to vice by years of suffering their father’s brutal temper. shallan also thinks jushu is a good man that could not be blamed for his vices. he is addicted to gambling, and will wager anything available to him, including any gemstones in his clothing. his addiction causes him to lie and steal in order to get money or credit to fund his gambling, although he has been able to restrain himself somewhat in order to help his family. he drinks wine heavily, especially while gambling, and is also seen rubbing a plant between his fingers which is likely highly addictive firemoss. wikim believes that jushu will inevitably destroy himself. attributes and abilities[edit] jushu likes duels and wishes he could participate in them. shallan has a fantasy in which she sees helaran sparring with jushu and teaching him swordsmanship, but it is not clear if this ever happened in reality. he has some understanding of the political machinations among veden lighteyes. history[edit] ""“he loved helaran, and none of us are him, so we don’t matter. helaran is never here! he betrayed father, almost killed him. and still, he’s the only one who matters.... ”-jushu, on his father's favoritism of helaran"" early life[edit] jushu was born as van jushu, the youngest of the davar brothers; he and wikim are fifteen months older than shallan. little is known of his youth, but he felt that his father always favored helaran and shallan over his other children, and recounted that lin only ever had curses for him. jushu was subjected to many fits of lin's temper, and was bitter towards his father. jushu believed the cover-up story that shallan had seen lin kill his wife, jushu's mother. he was not aware of the true sequence of events, and was the person that comforted shallan on the night of their mother's death. his father soon remarried, and malise gevelmar became his stepmother. as jushu became a teenager, lin's anger and neglect took its toll, and jushu began gambling and drinking heavily. around 1168, he showed up drunk to a feast held by lin for other lighteyes, which was sure to anger lin. he was present when shallan saw her mother's ""soul"" in a strongbox, although he could not see anything. about a year later, he attended another feast at the davar estate, and engaged in some friendly banter with his siblings. after redin interrupted the feast seeking someone to testify against lin, jushu seemed to consider it, but quickly lost his nerve. gambling debts[edit] as the years went on, jushu's gambling problems persisted. if any type of alcohol or wagering was available, his family assumed that he would be partaking in it. he would steal items from his father and sell them to fund his habits. jushu became known as asha jushu after his father officially disowned helaran. lin tasked him with checking on the outer davar lands around 1170. however, jushu fell in with a bookmaker named mill and spent his time drinking and gambling; he eventually took out a line of credit in the family name. when jushu was unable to fulfill his debts, mill and several thugs took him captive and traveled to the davar estate to collect. lin, who was secretly running out of money, declined to pay the debt of nearly one hundred emerald broams. the men beat jushu severely, then bound him and forced him to walk behind their carriage. shallan convinced balat and wikim to give her their engraved daggers; she offered them to mill along with her aluminum necklace to try and pay off his debts. mill told shallan that she had only accounted for about half of the debt, but she was surprisingly able to convince him to release jushu. shallan told jushu that his brothers deserved credit for saving him, and he was very thankful. after the incident with mill, balat assumed that jushu's addiction caused him to resume gambling, although he was trying to be smarter about it. shallan still considered jushu to be ""a mess"". lin's death[edit] ""“does it feel odd to anyone else to be this rich? how many deposits of valuable stone are there on our lands? ”-jushu"" after luesh became the davar house steward around 1172, the davar family's financial situation quickly turned around, as luesh was secretly a soulcaster and member of the ghostbloods. jushu enjoyed the newfound wealth, although it may have enabled him to start using firemoss. he was, however, the only sibling who questioned the origin of the suddenly plentiful ore deposits found on their lands. jushu was aware of balat's plan to run away with eylita tavinar. when lin discovered the plan and summoned eylita to their house, jushu, wikim, and shallan watched as lin and balat argued and eventually came to blows. shallan was the first to notice that lin had killed malise, and she poisoned him with blackbane. as the fight continued, jushu and wikim were horrified by lin's attacks on balat, but they did not enter the room until lin suddenly collapsed. jushu found the broken davar soulcaster in lin's pocket and was confused, thinking that his father was performing blasphemy. when the twins realized that lin was still alive, they could not finish the job and left it to shallan. aftermath and shallan's departure[edit] after their father's death, the siblings began to understand the previous source of their wealth and the urgency of their financial situation. lin had overextended himself with various business deals, and the ghostbloods wanted satisfaction from the davar family for breaking their soulcaster. their outlook was bleak; the family's debts were such that shallan believed they would be stripped of their titles and possibly enslaved. for a time, they pretended that lin was still alive, but they knew this was unsustainable. shallan left jah keved with a plan to try and steal jasnah's soulcaster as a replacement, while jushu helped balat sell their possessions to keep their family afloat. jushu's experience in selling goods stolen from lin to fuel his gambling allowed him to ""mask"" the reason behind the selling. jasnah eventually learned of shallan's predicament and sent the brothers some money while also offering navani's help to possibly fix their broken soulcaster; her brothers were excited by this new plan. however, the davar soulcaster was lost in the sinking of the wind's pleasure. move to urithiru[edit] as historic events began occurring across roshar, shallan felt guilty about abandoning her brothers. she lost contact with them after losing her spanreed on the wind's pleasure and became increasingly worried after learning of the veden civil war. after urithiru was discovered, she wrote them a number of letters telling them to come live with her there, but she did not receive any response. shallan eventually learned from mraize that the davar lands had fallen and that he was bringing her family to urithiru; her service to the ghostbloods as veil would fulfill the debt of the broken soulcaster. mraize fulfilled his promise and jushu, wikim, balat, and eylita arrived in urithiru after the battle of thaylen field. jushu's clothes were worn and he had lost some weight. the family reunited with shallan and attended her wedding to adolin kholin. jushu and his brothers were given quarters near shallan's in urithiru. shallan visited often, but she felt some regret about the way that she perceived jushu and the rest of her family after having changed so much since leaving her childhood home. jushu had to be watched constantly to ensure that he did not steal things and pawn them for gambling money. he unknowingly befriended mraize, who was posing as a guardsman named gobby. relationships[edit] lin davar[edit] lin always had a temper, and jushu's parents would fight even when he was a small child. jushu believes lin's story that he was the one who killed his mother. lin often screamed at jushu and mistreated him, much like he did with balat and wikim; this only became worse as lin became increasingly unstable over the years. jushu was particularly jealous of the love that lin showed for helaran. as jushu entered adulthood, lin thought of him as a worthless drunkard, although he still assigned him certain important tasks. their relationship was presumably not reparable after lin declined to help jushu with his gambling debts and several thugs beat him senseless. shallan[edit] shallan believes that jushu harbors some resentment towards her due to lin's favoritism, although he does not seem to lash out at her. he usually laughs at her jokes, even if they are not that funny. shallan never forgets that jushu held her on the night that their mother died. she cares for jushu, and she believes that he is a good man that was broken by lin's actions. she tries to distract him from gambling by suggesting that he watch duels instead, since she knows that he is interested in swordplay. she often thinks about jushu and her other brothers after leaving jah keved and she feels responsible for them. after lin's death, jushu and shallan no longer bond over defying him, and shallan worries that they could drift apart. however, she does not fully trust jushu due to his ongoing addictions, and cannot always tell if he is being genuine. they still attempt some banter, but their interactions become more awkward. notes[edit]"
Wikim Davar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Wikim_Davar,"tet wikim davar is a lighteyed veden on roshar, son of brightness davar and lin davar. his siblings include helaran, balat, his younger twin jushu, and shallan. appearance and personality[edit] wikim davar is the older twin and third son of the davar family. wikim is slender, pale, spindly, and with sunken eyes. his hair is cut so short he almost looked like an ardent. he shares some resemblance to his twin jushu, but they would not be mistaken for one another. after his mother's death wikim probably suffers from depression: he is so thin he looks sickly, he rarely talks or smiles, and he has suicidal thoughts. shallan helps him get out of the depression by pushing his interest in math. after this, wikim starts laughing again and becomes more interested in his studies. he even talks of becoming an ardent. he is not the affectionate type and always complains about hugs. one of his prominent personality traits is that he is thoughtful. attributes and abilities[edit] wikim likes math and seems to be proficient at it. he also seems to have biology knowledge, as he knows the effects of blackbane. after his father's death, he takes care of distracting creditors and seems to be able to keep them at bay for some time; this means he does have some political abilities. history[edit] when wikim was younger, his mother wanted him to be an ardent. after her death, he fell into depression, being a constant target of his father's anger. he would rarely speak, or even smile, and would stay long times staring at fires or walls. he did resent his father and when the highprince sent his bastard son to their house seeking for people who would speak against him, wikim asked shallan to do so. at the middlefest fair he decided to stay in the carriage, where shallan went to visit him. wikim saw through her and openly asked about her tricks for making all her brothers feel better. after stating that no woman or sword would do the trick with him, shallan gave him math problems that she had spent lots of time creating for him. though he dismissed the effort and her, making shallan feel miserable, he ended up taking a pencil and trying them with a smile on his face. after that day, he slowly came out of his depression. he almost always had math problems with him, at which his father first railed, but the ardents stood up and said this was the almighty's wish. wikim started laughing again and even talked of becoming an ardent himself. one day, he thanked shallan for her help and gave her a pouch with blackbane. he explained this plant would paralyze and even stop breathing; he had it because he had been thinking about suicide, but didn't need it anymore. he also explained the plant would become more powerful with time. the day balat was going to run away with eylita, wikim was the one to let him know his father had summoned her to their house. along with jushu, he stayed at the door of the feast hall while father and balat argued. they ran in when his father went to the floor paralyzed, thinking he was dead. shallan explained she used the pouch he had given her years ago. wikim was the one who found out he was still alive and stepped back. shallan had to step in to finish the job. after his father's death, and while shallan tried to steal jasnah's soulcaster, wikim helped balat with their house affairs. his role was to keep the creditors distracted. relationships[edit] shallan[edit] ""“i was wrong. about what you're doing. i see through it. and... and still it’s working. damnation, but it’s working. thank you. ”-wikim to shallan"" shallan spends much of her time trying to make her brothers feel better. in the case of wikim, she spends time preparing math problems for him. this helps him get out of his depression, and he expresses his gratefulness by giving her the pouch of blackbane he doesn't think he needs anymore. shallan loves him very much, and seeing him smile makes her feel warm inside. he does love her back, but complains when she shows him affection. lin davar[edit] wikim's father, just as he does to his other sons, screams at and mistreats him. although wikim hopes to become an ardent, lin likely would never allow him to, as he feels that in the absence of helaran and balat, wikim is the best one to lead the house. his father opposes his interest in math until he is convinced by his ardents that the almighty approves of his interest. notes[edit]"

Rose Palace,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rose_Palace,"the rose palace is the imperial palace of the rose empire on sel. it is located in the imperial seat. it is the residence of the ruling emperor and houses the rose throne. architecture[edit] the palace is a vast establishment composed of many different wings. the central wings of the palace, including the imperial wing, are made of quarried stone, and many rooms have stained glass windows installed. to connect the wings, there are many long hallways that are often decorated with portraits and pottery. the faction in control of the government decides which wings to utilize and maintain, often changing the style and decorations completely to fit their desired aesthetic. because of this tradition and the size of the complex, some portions of the palace are largely ignored at any given time and used primarily for storage. the palace is considered to be a beautiful structure, despite the general disrepair of some sections. features[edit] the palace includes an imperial gallery that boasts a vast collection of artwork and relics from across the rose empire, including the moon scepter. the arbiters have a shared study and at least some arbiters and other staff members also have personal offices or studies. the palace also has a well-equipped dungeon, at least one kitchen complex, a guardhouse for security forces,, gated walls, stables, and an extensive servants complex. it presumably has at least one dining hall that serves alcohol. the dungeon includes a cell specially designed to hold forgers, with forty-four types of rock in the walls and a ralkalest lining intended to make escape via forgery impossible. staff[edit] the palace is the residence of the emperor and his family, along with the five arbiters of the ruling faction. the palace's many servants have a dedicated section of the palace, near the stables. they wear buttoned uniforms with embroidered insignia on the left breast to represent their particular function in the palace. the emperor also employs an imperial fool. the palace guards are led by strikers due to their high esteem in the eyes of the arbiters, along with their natural athleticism. strikers are required to be literate to work in the palace. the guards, who are both male and female, have military-style ranks, and some strikers oversee lower-ranked ""common"" guards. weapons used by the guards include swords and daggers. history[edit] life in the palace was strictly regimented. the post arrived early every morning, and servants went about their tasks like clockwork. the palace hosted many notable personages, such as atsuko of jindo and an ambassador from fjorden. during the reign of emperor ashravan, the heritage faction made extensive use of rememberers to turn the imperial wing into an imitation of a much older building; ashravan took particular interest in the beauty of the palace. the faction recreated ornate lamio stonework and impressive lamio relics; even the emperor's headboard was forged to resemble a lamio style known only from historical texts. a study used by the arbiters was transformed into an imitation of a fifth century hunting lodge. the palace was the site of an attack attributed to the glory faction that killed kurshina and incapacitated ashravan. around the same time, wan shailu broke into the palace with the assistance of the imperial fool so she could test her skill by forging a copy of the moon scepter in the imperial gallery. she also broke into frava's study and replaced the priceless painting lily of the spring pond with a copy so she could destroy the original at the behest of its artist, han shuxen. shai was captured when the fool betrayed her and stole the original moon scepter; she was scheduled to be executed until the arbiters cut a deal with her to reforge the emperor's broken soul. shai was given one hundred days to complete the task; she was isolated in a small room in an abandoned part of the palace that was constantly guarded and bloodsealed. gaotona allowed shai to forge different parts of her quarters until they were the nicest in the palace. shai eventually completed her task, but she had been plotting her escape all along and was able to get out of the palace. trivia[edit] - the palace was temporarily the residence of - in his guise as the imperial fool. he wanted the moon scepter for unrevealed reasons that have implications beyond - . notes[edit]"

MaiPon,https://coppermind.net/wiki/MaiPon,"maipon is a sub-state of the rose empire on the planet of sel. it was absorbed into the rose empire long prior to the events of the emperor's soul. maipon is the homeland of forgery. because investiture on sel is concentrated in the cognitive realm, and thus dependent on geographic location, the power of a forgery diminishes the further a forgery is from maipon, similar to how the elantrian aons function. all forgeries include a lithograph resembling maipon on the reverse side of the stamp. the maipon are descended from the same people group as the jindo; they diverged long ago. they are commonly mistaken by other cultures as being identical. the maipon use chopsticks, known as maipon sticks, as eating utensils. the sticks were later adopted in jindo culture. physical traits[edit] the maipon are short of stature, have dark brown skin and fine features. religion[edit] the early maipons worshiped meteors, which they call the souls of broken gods. these meteors would be carved to bring out the shape of the gods. it is believed that the history of carving was responsible for the invention and advancement of forgery. wan shailu is from maipon, and is a follower of the god beyond. it is unclear if the religion is common in maipon or unique to shai. notes[edit]"
Kurshina,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kurshina,"kurshina is the former empress of the rose empire on sel. appearance and personality[edit] kurshina has red hair. little else is known about her, but she is likely close in age to her husband, emperor ashravan, who is forty. history[edit] during an assassination attempt against ashravan by the glory faction, kurshina was killed and ashravan sustained a brain injury that put him in a vegetative state. kurshina's death allowed the arbiters from the heritage faction to keep ashravan's condition secret from the empire, since tradition allowed him to have a mourning period of one hundred days. the arbiters publicly claimed that ashravan had sequestered himself while he mourned, enlisting shai to try to make an essence mark and fix ashravan's mind before the end of the mourning period. during shai's detailed research into ashravan's life, she discovered that ashravan's first love from a storybook had red hair; shai believed that this subconsciously drew him to kurshina. she also discovered that ashravan once nearly had an affair. after ashravan was stamped with shai's essence mark and woke up, he remembered kurshina's death. shai could see that this caused him intense grief, although he hid it quickly. he later vowed to punish his wife's murderers. notes[edit]"
Hoid,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Imperial_Fool,"""“and while i am your friend, please understand that our goals do not completely align. you must not trust yourself with me. if i have to watch this world crumble and burn to get what i need, i will do so. with tears, yes, but i would let it happen. ”-hoid to dalinar"" hoid is a recurring character in the cosmere, originally from yolen. hoid is not his original name; before telling kaladin the story of the wandersail, he claims he stole the name from someone he should have loved. the dragon frost once asked him in a letter if he is no longer hiding behind the name of his old master, likely referring to the name hoid. among the original vessels, hoid is often known as cephandrius, which is one of his earliest aliases. he is known as the god lunu'anaki to the horneaters. hoid was involved in the events taking place before any of the cosmere's published books begin, and is the second oldest character seen so far. he was originally human, but has changed enough that when asked, brandon only says ""it's complicated."" hoid is not a shard, nor is he a herald, but something else entirely. he is very skilled with disguises, and the overtness of his involvement varies from book to book. in some, he is named outright and makes references to other events and places in the cosmere, while in others he is seen only deep in disguise, almost unrecognizable. brandon has confirmed that all of these appearances are the same individual, but that he worldhops between planets. hoid's motives are unknown, and most of his actions occur behind the scenes. he is searching for something unknown. his particular style of storytelling in which he manipulates sand or smoke to illustrate his stories, as in warbreaker and the way of kings, does not originate from white sand, but from another unpublished story, the liar of partinel. in warbreaker, siri asked hoid where he learned his style of story telling. hoid answered, ""i learned it many, many years ago from a man who didn't know who he was, your majesty. it was a distant place where two lands meet and gods have died. but that is unimportant."" his origin will be revealed in the dragonsteel series, and so it is commonly believed hoid is from yolen, the world of dragonsteel and liar. he also has a ""home base"" somewhere in the cognitive realm. hoid is neither the author of the ars arcana, nor of the back-of-book blurbs for the stormlight archive. he occasionally will show up somewhere, stand around for a while, realize there isn't a novel-worthy plot going on, and leave. appearance & personality appearance hoid's appearance varies dramatically from book to book. he's often in disguise, which makes his true appearance difficult to ascertain. couple this with the fact that he can lightweave his appearance in order to look however he wants, it makes it nearly impossible to know for sure what he looks like. to the best of our knowledge, his face is lined, hawk-like and arrow shaped. hoid is tall and thin and also has a sharp nose and jaw with delicate eyebrows. he tends to cock his head to one side and has keen blue eyes. hoid's hair is white, though he was not born with that color and he occasionally dyes it. there is a particular reason for his hair being white, which will be revealed in the future. when he is on roshar during the war of reckoning and true desolation, serving as king elhokar kholin's, and later queen jasnah kholin's wit, hoid has the appearance of an alethi man in his mid-30s with deep onyx hair. he wears a stiff black coat and carries a long thin sword at his waist. this blade is not magically invested but has personal value to hoid. it is a symbol of office for the king/queen's wit, though hoid himself is not a skilled swordfighter. personality hoid's true personality, while also usually disguised, is more easily seen as he occasionally drops whatever part he is playing. one of his overall most noticeable traits is his sharp wit and intelligence. the characters he plays often have a penchant for jokes and mockery but when he removes the facade his personality often seems mysterious and grave. if he was asked about whether he called himself a good man personality-wise, hoid would reply with a ""no"". hoid is not always serious when he should be, due to how much normal human interaction bores him. hoid cannot directly physically harm people; this is an involuntary trait that is the result of changes to his spirit made during his time as a dawnshard. rock says he cannot hurt man because it is forbidden by other gods. he also tells a young shallan, ""you needn't fear me. i'm terribly ineffective at hurting people. i blame my upbringing."" hoid apologizes to kelsier after beating him in a fight, stating he doesn't have the inclination to do real harm to him. this aversion causes him to be nauseated when thinking about physically harming someone, and is sometimes bad enough to incapacitate him. however, this only extends to physical trauma- hoid has no issues with mentally hurting someone or through inaction. hoid also has issues with harming himself physically, such as when he has to manipulate another man into punching him when he wants a tooth knocked out, rather than just doing it himself. if he had the capacity to, he would be willing to kill to achieve his goals, he would also let even those he cares about perish if it meant the furtherance of his goals. hoid is a very kind person to those he takes a liking to, doing his best to emotionally console them and give them the will to keep going. this can be seen in the various times he has told kaladin stories in order to comfort him and teach him a lesson that he believes he needs to learn. he has done the same to shallan, most notably when he met her as a child traumatized by her experiences and the abuses she went through during the middlefest fair. here, he consoles her and gave her motivation to keep moving forward. he did the same later, when speaking with her in kholinar. he occasionally uses allomancy to help soothe people. while he is very comforting to those he likes, and can sometimes be open about some parts of his past; he does make sure to insure that they never come to trust him too much, and that the understand what kind of person he is. on the other end, he finds great joy in tormenting those he hates, such as ruthar, rayse, or kelsier. this is likely a large part in his enjoyment of playing the role of court jesters like the king's wit or the imperial fool. this behavior of his tends to rub many people the wrong way, making him despised by many people he interacts with. he sometimes bickers even with those he likes, such as design, though this takes the form of an exasperated fondness rather than bitter mockery. he deeply enjoys storytelling, and has learned many stories over his long life. the stories he tells often have a personal or thematic relevance to those he is telling them to. though sometimes, he simply tells stories for the sake of telling them, as he feels that as stories exist, they must be told. as a storyteller, he deeply hates when people spoil his stories. he also enjoys pontificating on the nature of art and storytelling to whoever would listen. he also enjoys asking people questions of philosophy and ideology, and would do so even with complete strangers. he uses these questions in order to use the answers of others as a jumping off point to share his own philosophy on the subject in question. another thing he finds joy in is getting away with things. for unknown reasons, he was willing to turn down the immense power of a shard when it was offered to him. this is likely connected to his self-professed distrust of the vessels to make their own decisions. he has a very negative outlook on himself, often believing that he has no answers for others or even any answers at all, believes that he should never be trusted due to what he is willing to do to achieve his goals, he thinks himself arrogant and regrets many of his actions and inactions throughout his life, and he does not consider himself a good man. he even considers a dawnshard itself to have become completely worthless in his wearing of it. philosophy he believes that the main thing that people value in creation is not the creature itself, but the novelty, timeliness, and originality of it. observing that if two people make the same discovery independently, the one who reveals their discovery first is the one given credit and lauded for their innovation, while the second is considered a forger. that if two artists create similar works of comparable pulchritude independent of each other, one would be lauded and the other would be bemoaned as derivative. he claims that if it was truly a matter of the aesthetic beauty of a work, but rather which came first. from this, he claims that the idea that what is valued most is creative ability, wisdom, and invention to be nothing more than a lie that humanity tells itself. he admits that it is a rather cynical viewpoint, but holds to it regardless. he feels that art and aesthetic beauty is not some eternal idea outside of humanity, but rather that it inherently relies upon and is defined by humanity. that art produced with low audience expectations can gain much love and loyal following from those given more then they expect; but conversely, an artist held in very high esteem can have their works torn apart and considered a failure for falling even slightly short from expectations. aesthetic beauty is given definition through audience expectation and interpretation, it relies deeply upon audience participation, and therefore is not eternal and independent. he claims that this aspect of art makes it fundamentally unfair. he furthers this idea to say that the concept of expectation defining value extends to all parts of life, such as in financial gains. he believes that all great art is necessarily hated due to the variety in human tastes, that to make it so nobody would hate a work of art, one must remove everything that makes it special, therefore making it so that it is loved by nobody. being hated is not proof that art is great, but not being hated is proof that it is not. he believes that art is about emotion, examination and going places people have never gone before to discover and investigate new things; it is from this definition of art, and his recognition of the subjective nature of aesthetic taste, that he argues that all great art is necessarily hated by somebody. when questioning himself on how many people need to love a work of art to outweigh the hate it inevitably inspires, and balance out the risk. thus, if even one person loves a work, no matter how many people hate it, it is worthwhile. he believes that stories don't live until they are imagined in someone's mind, and that everyone's experience of the story is individual and unique. he believes that the meaning of a story is up to the audience themselves to decide; that it is not meant to tell them how to think, but instead to give them questions to think upon. he thinks that the interpretations people have of stories are based upon what they themselves are looking for, as are the answers they find in them. his belief in how stories take on life in the minds of an audience is likely a reason for his feeling of obligation to tell the stories that he learns to whoever will listen. attributes and abilities hoid does not yet have the abilities of every planet he's visited. some of his powers predate the shattering, but none of them are gained through hemalurgy. hoid is concerned about opening himself up to the influence of shards, so he only gains access to manifestations of investiture through more conventional, but more difficult ways. hoid has access to multiple invested arts, but not an incredibly large number. he is likely the most powerful non-shard entity in the cosmere, although a few of the older dragons and aethers might rival him. after odium stole some of his memories, hoid instituted protection protocols to defend himself if something or someone tried to interact with his soul. this causes his body to be frozen in time, while his mind remains unaffected. in this state, he is still able to make connections with others, and may even see and hear from those he is connected with. the physical stasis was not what hoid intended to happen and it will last until the person stops trying to interact with his soul. there are only a few things in the cosmere that are capable of hurting him, one of which is likely nightblood, and he stays far away from all of them. hoid also has an unknown seon. illusions ""“i see. you do not yet understand the nature of lies. i had that trouble myself, long ago. the shards here are very strict. you will have to see the truth, child, before you can expand upon it. just as a man should know the law before he breaks it. ”-hoid on lightweaving to shallan"" hoid has access to an invested art known as lightweaving that originates from yolen prior to the shattering of adonalsium. lightweaving allows for the creation of optical and auditory illusions. this lightweaving is much less restrictive than the later rosharan variant, and does not require a spren or stormlight to function. hoid sometimes makes use of this ability in his disguises although he has several ways of changing how he looks including practical effects. he may also make use of it in some of his storytelling, such as the pictures of derethil and the wandersail that kaladin sees in the smoke when hoid is telling him a story. hoid's yolish lightweaving does not always seem to function perfectly on roshar; in fact, he needs help from shallan to fully craft an illusion. his power is somehow limited, and he has trouble making some aspects of it work, even after multiple attempts. it is uncertain why this occurs and whether or not this issue is unique to roshar. hoid's bonding of a cryptic will provide abilities that supplement his own lightweaving and allows him to overcome his issues crafting illusions, although further impacts or resonances between the two are unknown. hoid's access to yolish lightweaving does allow him to guide another lightweaver's power, although this is not something he would be able to do with just any invested art. worldhopping hoid travels between various planets within the cosmere by making use of perpendicularities, places usually created by the presence of a shard on a planet where the sheer power of investiture causes the borders between the realms to be weakened. a knowledgeable person such as hoid is able to transition from the physical realm to the cognitive realm. hoid can then travel to a different world's subastral, as the distances between worlds in the cognitive realm are much smaller than in the physical realm. hoid is very proficient at traveling in the cognitive realm. he can easily travel to any world that has an active perpendicularity, even those worlds where the perpendicularities are dangerous to pass through such as the well of ascension. hoid is known to be aware of perpendicularities on scadrial, sel, and roshar, and likely knows of nalthis's perpendicularity as well. while hoid typically makes use of natural perpendicularities in his travels, later in life he may also have access to an ability that essentially allows him to generate his own personal perpendicularity, much like the surge of transportation. dawnshard ""“other men . . . other men, as they age, merely grow stranger. i fear that i am one of those. i am the bones of a foreign species left drying on the plain that was once, long ago, a sea. a curiosity, perhaps a reminder, that all has not always been as it is now. ”-hoid on his age"" hoid held the dawnshard with an intent diametrically opposed to the concepts of harm and violence for a long period of time. his time holding it caused changes to his spiritweb in a similar manner to savantism. these changes meant that long-term, hoid found himself unable to inflict harm on himself or any others, as well as unable to eat meat he believes was naturally produced (i.e., he could eat meat he believes was made in a lab or by magic). his dawnshard is in some way connected to the first gem, his eponymous topaz. there were other side effects of the dawnshard. hoid held it for so long that not only is he ageless, it has become essentially impossible for him to die. while other people who have held this dawnshard have gained the ability to skip and teleport from planet to planet, hoid has not for most of his life had access to this ability, and it is uncertain if he ever gained it. time-dilation in addition to his agelessness, hoid has not actually experienced all those years, instead making use of some time-dilation technique that may render him somehow unconscious or unaware. however, hoid does not have the ability to travel backwards in time. healing factor ""“i'd be surprised if that little knife of yours poses me any real threat, kholin. ”-hoid to jasnah on her shardblade"" hoid has access to some sort of healing factor that is capable of repairing both the body and the soul. he is able to regenerate any damaged body parts at will, including his head. he can also heal from being stabbed hemalurgically. hoid is able to repress his healing factor in some way, preventing instantaneous healing, an ability that he makes use of in some of his disguises. this healing factor makes it very difficult to kill hoid, although he is still at least somewhat vulnerable. the name of the manifestation of investiture responsible for hoid's healing is unknown, but it is ancient, likely originating from some pre-shattering source. it is uncertain whether or not this healing factor is at all related to hoid's apparent agelessness, which is known to originate from a remnant of a weapon built to kill adonalsium. hoid is unafraid of shardblades for multiple reasons, probably including his healing factor. fortune ""“i have discovered a place that i must be, though to be honest i'm not exactly sure why i need to be there. this doesn't always work as well as i'd like it to.”-hoid to dalinar"" hoid has access to an ability that allows him to make use of the spiritual attribute of fortune, which grants him a limited amount of foresight. hoid's fortune ability gives him an innate knowledge of where and when he needs to be. while this ability may grant him knowledge of what he is to do, usually hoid does not know why his ability has brought him to a specific place. hoid's fortune ability is not infallible; occasionally it directs him to go somewhere, but either nothing notable is happening or he is unable to discover the reason why he has been led there. hoid's fortune ability has let him know about instant noodles, although he has had prior experience with them on taldain. connection hoid has access to some manifestation of investiture that allows him to manipulate the spiritual attribute of connection. the full extent of this ability is unknown, but its primary known use is to help hoid speak the various languages of the worlds of the cosmere that he visits. the ability allows him to connect to whatever land he is in, temporarily altering his spiritual aspect to believe that he was raised in that place, allowing him to speak as a native. while hoid has learned naturally how to speak some foreign languages, and is decent with languages, he desires to pass as a local oftentimes, which requires something beyond natural learning. generally he makes use of his connection ability to communicate in foreign languages. this ability is not without fault though, as when hoid speaks naturally it will fill in local idioms and phrases on its own, but if hoid is careless and focuses on a specific word or phrase the ability may fail and he will say the word verbatim in his own tongue or it may be said in an odd way. hoid is an expert in using his connection ability, but even he sometimes makes mistakes. this is the reason he occasionally slips up and may say words that confuse others, such as ""coin"" and ""bunny"" on roshar. as hoid has demonstrated the ability to fluently speak foreign languages before the knowledge of unsealed metalminds became widespread, it is unlikely that he is making use of feruchemical duralumin to manipulate connection. visions hoid, via unknown means, is able to enter and exit certain visions, as well as bring those he is bonded with, like design. while doing so, he creates a large, pure white bubble of light, which can shelter those who have been brought into the vision naturally. while in the vision, hoid is able to create whatever objects he wants. hoid is only able to do this for roughly twenty minutes before being detected. metallic arts hoid has also gained access to allomancy, by burning a bead of lerasium stolen from the well of ascension. this grants him power equivalent to that of the ancient allomancers. it is uncertain how practiced he is with these powers, but he does make use of emotional allomancy on at least one occasion. he also has access to atium. it is unknown whether or not hoid has access to feruchemy. however, he does have access to some unkeyed metalminds, which would not be useful to him without feruchemical abilities or unsealed metalminds. the particular attributes that are stored in these metalminds are unknown. hoid does not make use of hemalurgy, to gain access to the metallic arts or any other manifestation of investiture, as he is concerned about opening himself up to the influence of shards. he does, however, own many hemalurgic spikes. awakening ""“perfect pitch makes this all so much easier than it once was.... ”-hoid to kaladin on making music"" as a yolish man, hoid was not himself born with any biochromatic breath. however at some point hoid has gained access to enough biochromatic breath to bring him to at least the second heightening. this means hoid has at least two hundred breaths, which grant him the ability to recognize unsupressed breath auras and judge about how much breath another awakener has, as well as perfect pitch. that is not to say that hoid may not have reached a higher heightening, just that the second heightening is his minimum power level. hoid's level of skill with awakening is still unknown, as he has only made use of it on one known occasion, when he awakened a doll, causing it to walk. this makes it difficult to ascertain his knowledge of commands or complex awakenings. hoid's level of control over investiture does allow him to suppress his breath aura, making it difficult to be noticed by others. however, there are various methods of detecting investiture that could circumvent this suppression. hoid's perfect pitch does aid him in tuning instruments and making music. additionally, holding breath has allowed hoid to somehow outsource some of his memory to said breath. after odium's destruction of some of these breaths in order to wipe his short-term memory, his level of breath was reduced to just under the second heightening, resulting in a loss of perfect pitch. surgebinder ""“it's either go with me now or wait it out and get captured. i honestly don't even know if you've the mind to listen. but if you do, know this: i will give you truths. and i know some juicy ones. ”-hoid to his cryptic, design"" hoid has bonded the cryptic design, which grants him access to surgebinding. while the enhanced reflexes and healing permitted by stormlight will likely be less useful to hoid, the nahel bond allows him to access the surges of illumination and transformation. this allows hoid to soulcast, transforming one type of matter to another by persuading its cognitive aspect as well as lightweaving, which grants him the ability to create visual and auditory illusions. this rosharan lightweaving seems to have a compounding effect with his yolish lightweaving, and allows him to circumvent the problems that he has experienced with his own illusions. although hoid's ideals are unknown, it may eventually grant him a shardblade and shardplate, and he likely has access to at least a shardblade from their bond. out of all of the orders of the knights radiant, lightweaver was his first choice, as lightweaving matches him very well and he's quite familiar and experienced with it. having full access to lightweaving is a fulfillment of a long, long quest for him. elantrian ""“it was constructed of aons. which i could now draw. the mechanics might bore you. the results, though, were spectacular.”-hoid's narration, tress of the emerald sea"" hoid became an elantrian through winning a bet he made with riina, a member of the ire. despite his short time with the power, hoid showed a notable aptitude for the manipulation of aons, being able to edit a complex aondor ""curse"" placed on charlie by riina, who herself is a highly experienced wielder of aondor. additionally, hoid was shown to have spent significant time coveting this specific invested art. his knowledge of aondor is strong enough that he is able to hack the system in order to use it off of sel. storytelling method hoid tells stories with smoke and sand. sand in warbreaker, lightsong calls hoid to tell the story of hallandren history to him and siri. as he told the story, he dropped sands, dusts, and small objects, mixing them together to produce various effects. he began by trailing sand out of his hand, then he added a powdery black sand, when both trails mixed it became a white sand. he began to scatter fern leaves and then threw the handful up with blue and deep red dust making it seem like a minor explosion. he sprinkled silver glitter in front of him, then trailed powdery brown dirt. black dust, and then flower petals. he then sent out a spray of half a dozen colors from both hands. then bright yellow dust from one hand and black from the other. torn writing on paper, followed by metal bits, black charcoal dust from both hands, he crumbled clay, sprinkled golden dust around, bits of grass and earth, a white powder and then a spray of water that turned into mist. smoke while telling stories with smoke he uses a flute, blowing the smoke, it may be yolish lightweaving that causes patterns and images to appear in smoke. in the way of kings the chasms echoed the music allowing him to speak and play, without the music ever seeming to stop. it is unclear how the flute could be used without chasms or canyons. history origins ""“other men . . . other men, as they age, merely grow stranger. i fear that i am one of those. i am the bones of a foreign species left drying on the plain that was once, long ago, a sea. a curiosity, perhaps a reminder, that all has not always been as it is now.”-hoid on his age"" at an unknown date the individual who would later become known as hoid was conceived naturally under wedlock on yolen. from an early age he developed a fascination with the topic of whether life existed on other planets and often listened to local philosophers debate the topic. later on as an adult hoid ended up holding a dawnshard, for reasons unknown this dawnshard was associated with topaz and thus earned him one of his oldest aliases as well as the title 'bearer of the first gem'. holding this dawnshard had a profound effect on hoid as it permanently altered his spiritweb, stopped him from aging and caused him to be unable to harm others. around the same time, for reasons also unknown, hoid's hair changed from its natural colour to pure white and he also gained access to numerous systems of investiture that predated the shattering, notable among these was yolish lightweaving which he would continue to use throughout his life. whilst a dawnshard hoid travelled throughout yolen and met various sho del and dragons, as well as this he was known to get in trouble due to his ability to lightweave. during this period hoid also had served a 'master' of some form who would later die, it is from them that he would later take the name of hoid. eventually hoid met and befreinded frost who was his elder by a small amount. shortly afterwards hoid assumed the identity of cephandrius maxtori and under this alias became acquainted with the sixteen original vessels, thus granting him a level of insight as to each of their personalities. hoid became drinking buddies with tanavast and upon meeting him considered ati to be one of the nicest people he ever met. notably during this time he met and became good friends with rayse. he also developed an interest in the endowment shard during this period of his life. for reasons unknown the idea of killing adonalsium emerged, whilst reluctant to help with this idea hoid did believe it to be necessary. hoid was present during the events of the shattering, although he did not directly participate in events as they played out, despite this however the dawnshards, of which he was one, were used in order to kill adonalsium.}} immeidately upon the shattering taking place the original sixteen shards were created, hoid was offered one of these but refused it, due to his refusal someone else became a vessel in his place. in the ensuing discussion hoid did imply, but not promise, that he would not interfere with the other shards or there activities in the future, this implication would be broken many times in the ensuing years. like with the rest of the cosmere the shattering had a large impact on himself, one such change was that of investiture which has behaved 'oddly' around him ever since, as well as this his lightweaving then suddenly had issues functioning as it had before. as well as this hoid lost someone very dear to himself due to the event, and also left the encounter holding a grudge against rayse and bavadin. in the years following the shattering hoid eventually gave up his dawnshard and left yolen, going on to explore the wider cosmere. the desolations he knew the heralds, and they recognize him by the name midius. he was the one that taught them how they could use investiture to enhance their memories. whether he knew them before or after the oathpact, or the exact nature of their relationship, is unclear. at some point after the shattering, hoid visited roshar and mingled with the original inhabitants of the world, even dancing with the ancient singers. he grew to be close with one singer known as vatwha. hoid is worshipped by the unkalaki as lunu'anaki, the god of travel and mischief who cannot hurt man. hoid founded the worldsingers, and has the rank of master worldsinger. he has been to aimia at some point. hoid attempted to bond a nahel spren at some point before the recreance, possibly during a desolation, but presumably failed. crisis in the diem hoid traveled to taldain, though for what reasons are unknown. he was there when the taishin were deciding whether or not to disband the diem. hoid later got onto the boat khriss took to return to darkside, where he sang a song to the passengers about the meaning of art. the restoration of elantris and theft of the moon scepter ""“there is beauty in every disaster, friend, if you are clever enough to find it. ”-hoid to a skaze"" hoid traveled to sel, likely making use of devotion's perpendicularity in arelon. hoid spoke to the skaze, and seems to have made some sort of agreement with them hinging on his desire to become an elantrian with the restoration of elantris. hoid disguised himself as a beggar, wrapped in bandages. he helped sarene smuggle weapons into elantris. following the restoration of the city by raoden, hoid traveled to the pool to meet a skaze. he removed his bandages, hoping to find himself transformed into an elantrian, but the transformation had not occurred. the skaze ridiculed hoid for his failure, but hoid expressed his joy that secrets still remained unknown to him and then entered the perpendicularity and transitioned to the cognitive realm. hoid returned to sel several years later, and found himself a position in the court of emperor ashravan in the rose empire as the royal fool. he allied himself with the forger shai in her attempt to steal the moon scepter, an artifact that allows for the translation of the various symbols of selish investiture. he arranged for her to be caught after she'd left the gallery with the scepter, later using her duplicate to steal the scepter for himself. hoid stole the moon scepter in order to help him translate between various symbols and gain access to the magics on sel. at some point, he and shai ran into each other once again, after shai devoted herself towards finding him again to take her revenge. the collapse of the final empire and catacendre hoid arrived on scadrial, likely through ruin's perpendicularity in the pits of hathsin. he took up the guise of an informant, pretending to have bad eyesight in order to make himself less threatening to people seeking information from him. at some point he became known to both dockson and ashweather cett. kelsier, pretending to be a nobleman, contacted hoid in 1022 fe, requesting information on house renoux. hoid (closed shop, smoking tobacco) met with kelsier on the streets of luthadel and told him that house renoux was buying large amounts of weapons and armor from various noble houses and that lord renoux was considering a marriage between valette and elend venture. he also claimed that renoux was rumored to have some sort of leverage on venture and that he knew shan elariel to be a soother. at some point following this, he left scadrial to attend to other business, again likely via the pits. around a year later, in 1023 fe, hoid returned to scadrial, traveling through scadrial's subastral, riding on the back of a cognitive shadow to the well of ascension, preservation's perpendicularity. he was using an oar coated with a strange glowing substance connected to the substance drunk by members of the ire. he encountered the shadow of kelsier, who asked for help returning to the physical realm. hoid told him that there was nothing to be done, but he challenged kelsier to an insult battle, with the prize being the true answer to one question. kelsier instead threatened hoid. hoid attempted to enter the pool, but kelsier attacked him. hoid easily overpowered kelsier and caused him serious pain, but not permanent injury. hoid then transitioned through the well and stole a bead of lerasium from the adjacent room. he later consumed the lerasium and became a mistborn. when kelsier spoke of the incident to preservation, preservation spoke briefly on hoid, calling him cephandrius. later, kelsier told khriss and nazh about his meeting with hoid, and they seemed distressed to know that he had arrived and stolen a bead of lerasium. hoid then traveled to the terris dominance to figure out feruchemy, and then became wrapped up in matters he did not anticipate. this may refer to him becoming involved after the inquisitor attack on tathingdwen and the slaughter of the synod. hoid took up the guise of a terris leader and led the terris refugees to the central dominance. a year later, in 1025 fe, hoid was in fadrex city, again acting as an informant, and ashweather cett suggested vin speak to him. just before vin arrived, kelsier's cognitive shadow noticed hoid from within the cognitive realm. kelsier tried to touch hoid's soul, but was rebuffed by a shock that numbed his hand. at that moment, vin arrived intending to meet with hoid, but kelsier attempted to warn her away. since he was in the cognitive realm, he couldn't communicate with her directly, but she did sense that something was off about hoid and instead chose not to speak to him. he has travelled to scadrial several times between the catacendre and the true desolation, but actively hid from harmony. during these visits he accomplished much, but what exactly he was doing is currently unknown. the pahn kahl rebellion several centuries later, around nalthian year 327, hoid traveled to nalthis and took the role of a master storyteller. lightsong summoned him to the court of the gods, where he recounted the story of vo, explained the origin of the hallandren god kings, and answered lightsong and siri's questions. he likely achieved perfect pitch while on this world by obtaining additional breaths. at some later point, vivenna also met hoid; she later described him as one of the only people on nalthis that is cosmere-aware. hoid spent a lot of time gambling on nalthis, and was fairly renowned. he would arrange things so that he could never lose, and then bet everything on himself. however, someone else managed to arrange it so that he couldn't win, either, resulting in a tie and the loss of his winnings. vasher once met hoid when he was using the alias ""dust"", several years before vasher's activities on roshar. obrodai hoid visited obrodai at some point prior to the true desolation. a female avatar was created by autonomy and instilled with a great dislike of hoid in order to prevent him from returning there. prelude to the true desolation ""“i've come to your land to chase an old acquaintance, but i end up spending most of my time hiding from him instead. ”-hoid to kaladin."" according to cord, when her grandmother served as watcher of the pool, hoid warned the unkalaki about the gods who sleep not. rock also described an encounter with him in the horneater oceans. in a departure from his modus operandi, hoid played a more conspicuous role in the events on roshar, as his goal was to become a radiant. he has been to threnody at some point before this visit to roshar. at some point, sigzil became his apprentice. as master and apprentice, they traveled all across roshar, including to babatharnam. he had to pay to have sigzil freed from prison on three separate occasions. this relationship essentially ended after sigzil attempted (and failed) to kill somebody and wound up punished via being made into a slave and bridgeman. ""“keep cutting away at those thorns, strong one, and make a path for the light.”-hoid to shallan"" in palah 1170 during the middlefest fair in jah keved, shallan davar met hoid disguised as a messenger, and he spoke with her. seeing that she was emotionally distressed, he used emotional allomancy in order to soothe her, and encouraged her to keep on pushing forward despite her struggles. this meeting would leave a deep impression upon shallan, and she would remember him for years after the event. he met lift at some point after her blessing by the nightwatcher in 1170, but before her heist on the bronze palace in 1173.[citation needed] she was fond of him, and they parted ways when he jumped into the mouth of a greatshell. ishikk was hired by three men from the seventeenth shard to search for hoid in the purelake, though all four failed to find him. he searched for five months, though came up with no results. the war of reckoning only a few months before the greatshell hunt on kakabach 1173, he became the king's wit, elhokar kholin's court jester. as the king lived at the shattered plains in order to better lead his people during the war of reckoning, wit spent most of his time at the plains. he was aware of sigzil being held in slavery at the plains, but still avoided interacting with him, though not necessarily out of a lack of care. through his role as wit, he kept his eyes upon and influenced dalinar kholin, going so far as to ask him if he has ever heard the term ""adonalsium"", as he believed that he was involved in secret societies such as the sons of honor, and thought that gavilar kholin confided in him; his suspicions were proven wrong. he also told kaladin the story of derethil and the wandersail on tanataches 1173. during the course of the story, hoid uses a special, ancient flute called a trailman's flute. it is also likely that he used his yolish lightweaving to cause the smoke from the fire to take the form of various elements from his story. he told the story in order to teach kaladin to take responsibility. as he sent him off, he gave him his trailman's flute, and asked him to take care of sigzil. hoid was in kholinar when taln arrived to herald the coming of the desolation on tanatabah 1173. before his arrival, he was discussing with a few guards the nature of creativity, invention, and wisdom, and the deep importance in novelty and timeliness in all three. when he arrived, he apologized to his old friend, remarking that he was already too late. later, hoid acted as the carriage driver for adolin when he is visiting shallan at sebarial's warcamp. he speaks to kaladin about his flute and mentions that he wants an interesting story from him. when shallan recognizes him she happily hugs him for his advice from three and a half years prior when he encouraged her at her worst and told her to keep seeking the light. hoid, acting as wit, visits kaladin while he is in prison on ishahach 1173, seven days into his imprisonment. he tells kaladin the story of a man named fleet who raced a highstorm across one end of roshar to the other. fleet wins, but dies of exhaustion at the end, and his spirit goes on to race the wind forever. the true desolation after the start of the true desolation circa ishishach 1173, on the day that the everstorm was projected to hit shinovar on jesesev 1174, he monologued to a sleepless hordling about the nature of art. after he finished his monologue, he met with jasnah kholin as she exited the cognitive realm, offering to travel with her. hoid next appeared as wit in alethkar, discussing the nature of power with shallan. prior to that, while telling the story of mishim in alethkar, hoid sees something next to his pack, which startles him. after the story, shallan looks into hoid's pack and sees a small, sealed black jar. the side of the jar pointing at shallan was white. this might be a jar of sand from taldain's dayside, with the sand turning white showing hoid a surgebinder is near. this may be important, but not much is known about it. during hoid's conversation with shallan, he says that he knew of a group like the cult of moments, describing them as equally foolish and dangerous. it is unclear at the moment which group he may be referring to. he later helps her get into the cult of moments, finding shallan at her darkest moment, when she discovered the food she has been giving to the poor is just making things worse. shalash, upon seeing sketches of talenel and herself, wondered aloud why midius, another name for hoid, was giving away drawings of them. shortly after the battle of thaylen field circa nanishah 1174, hoid was in kholinar insulting a thaylen man in an attempt to elicit a reaction. upon realizing that the man couldn't understand alethi, hoid decided that repeating it all in thaylen would be boring, so he cut in front of the man. the man hit hoid, knocking loose a tooth which hoid discarded upon leaving the area. while in the city, he noticed vatwha, recognizing her as an old acquaintance. despite this old camaraderie, the fused were trained to watch for him - most likely to capture him and deliver him to odium. while walking through the city he found a child around the corpse of her mother, and used awakening to lure her away from the body, leaving her in the care of a family in the city. he then headed to the palace where he finds a cryptic, the spren elhokar was about to bond before he died. this spren was design, and he bonded to her, becoming a knights radiant of the order of lightweavers. during an unknown point in the year between his bonding of design and the expedition in emul and singer occupation of urithiru, he and jasnah began a romantic relationship. campaign in emul he and jasnah both went to the expedition in emul in 1175. during their expedition, ruthar angered them both greatly, and jasnah sent him to insult the highprince. after doing so, ruthar challenged him to combat, but he choose jasnah as his champion. she easily stabbed him through the throat, but had renarin heal him. he notices that a sleepless was spying upon him. when kaladin was stuck in a vision by odium, he appeared to him in order to tell him the story of the dog and the dragon, in order to try and cheer him up and point him in the right direction. writing the contract and the ascension of taravangian he and jasnah worked together in order to write up a contract for the contest of champions with odium. some time after taravangian took up odium on vevishev 1174, hoid was visited by the new vessel while he was telling stories at the shattered plains. taravangian's demeanor revealed what happened to hoid, who, terrified by the idea of odium having a new vessel, began to leave. realizing that he was found out, odium rammed into him with energy in order to lock him in place, trying to find a way to harm him without breaking the shardic oath he was still held to. while searching, he discovered that hoid kept his short-term memories stored in his breaths. he destroyed these, erasing part of his memory, in order to redo the interaction. in this second interaction, taravangian was able to interact with hoid while successfully convincing the man that he was still rayse. hoid left this second conversation believing that everything had gone according to plan. however, afterwards he became aware of the fact that his memories were stolen and instituted protection protocols to defend himself if something or someone tried to interact with his soul. the destruction of his breaths led him to falling below the second heightening, and losing his perfect pitch. sigzil and the dawnshard ""“i was wrong. i did the best with the situation i had, hoping it would prevent calamity. i ruined your life, and i was wrong. i’m sorry. ”-hoid to sigzil"" at some point, hoid asked his apprentice sigzil to briefly take up the same dawnshard that gave hoid his immortality, an action that he believed would be necessary to avert calamity. hoid passed the dawnshard to sigzil, who was changed in some ways that were similar to hoid, acquiring the ability to skip to any planet in the cosmere, as well as his own inability to do violence. this action would ultimately cause sigzil to nearly kill his spren auxiliary when the dawnshard drew upon the investiture that made up the spren in an attempt to defend itself. this action ruined sigzil's life, and forced him to remain on the move outrunning the night brigade in their quest to capture him. hoid regained possession of that dawnshard again as well, meaning sigzil was ultimately running from the night brigade to prevent them from finding hoid. however, hoid has come to feel sorrowful for his actions here, and feels like though his motivations were noble, the outcomes were ultimately not worth it and he was wrong to have done what he did. the letters at some point, he wrote a letter to frost. it offers valuable insights into his personality and goals. he wrote about how he was being hunted by the seventeenth shard and has set a false trail for them to follow, referencing the three figures sent by the seventeenth shard that were searching for him. he came across as not at all worried about them, and in fact seemed mildly amused. he attempted to contact various shards about rayse and his worries that he would eventually escape. the figures he contacted were endowment, autonomy, and harmony. the first two responded with aggressive dismissal, but harmony was very receptive to his contact and responded curiosity and a desire for further contact. due to him being more receptive towards his advances, he contacted harmony again, and requested that he try to contact other shards concerning the growing threat of rayse's escape from the rosharan system, a request he fulfilled. this contact resulted in a variety of different responses, which, as with his own attempts, resulted mostly in dismissal. post-catacendric scadrial ""“oh, my lord, i know it, i do. i own the place, technically. now, regarding those coins for old hoid, my good lord... ”-hoid to wax"" in 342 pc, following his actions on roshar, hoid returned to scadrial to attend the wedding of lord joshin yomen and lady mi'chelle ostlin, two friends of his that he had made at some unknown point in the past. he did so via finding some way to bypass the strong connection binding him to roshar after becoming a knights radiant. rather than coming to scadrial in response to some important event, hoid initially came merely to congratulate his friends. he came dressed all in black, appearing as a scruffy looking beggar and spoke to the couple soon after they arrived at the dinner. it is unknown if he was present for the subsequent vanisher attack. hoid may have left the planet briefly afterwards, but something on scadrial had caught his attention and he was back several months later. hoid became employed as waxillium ladrian's new carriage driver. by that point he had become friendly with wayne, who liked him but did not know anything about hoid's true identity. when wax headed to the precinct station to question rian, hoid drove the carriage and wayne rode up front with him. during the carriage ride, hoid eavesdropped on wax's conversation with harmony about bleeder's plans to disrupt the elendel basin. hoid's actions after this point are unclear. hoid somehow obtained a coin-like unsealed metalmind containing a memory of kelsier aiding the southern scadrians in surviving the aftereffects of the catacendre. he also spent some time in new seran and following nazh's theft of nicki savage's map of new seran, hoid asked her if she wanted to hear a story, an offer that she declined. he has also somehow come to the conclusion that he is the true owner of kelesina shores' mansion there, for somewhat legitimate but unknown reasons. he was apparently a regular intruder on the mansion grounds, to the irritation of the guards. during this time, hoid took the appearance of a beggar with long, unkempt fingernails and a ragged shirt. hoid appeared blind with milky white eyes. when waxillium ladrian walked up the path to kelesina's mansion to attend a party with steris harms, hoid climbed out of the bushes, startling wax, although wax did not recognise hoid as his carriage driver through his disguise. wanting to reveal kelsier's resurrection and identity as the sovereign, hoid looked for an opportunity to pass on the unsealed metalmind. he asked wax for a few clips. steris noticed hoid's cologne and asked him if he was wearing cologne. hoid was startled by her observation and claimed that he had been drinking perfume, as it had quite a kick. steris told him that that was unhealthy and wax advised hoid that he should leave the private grounds. hoid agreed but claimed that it was his property and again asked for coins. wax gave him a banknote and told him again to leave the grounds. hoid claimed it was far too much and that he wished to give waxillium change. as wax walked away, hoid threw the coin at wax's head, who caught it in midair. a groundsman then noticed hoid and tried to chase him off. hoid laughed and escaped back into the bushes again. ""“carriage for you, sir? ”-hoid to wax in the middle of the ocean"" hoid later became involved in the sting operation that marasi ran in bilming in 348 pc. he had a silent interaction with moonlight from different trucks. moonlight commented that she couldn't tell whether she was watching hoid or if hoid was watching her, but then resolved that they were both just keeping an eye on the same third parties. after wax arrived in bilming, and gave chase to dumad he casually appeared in a sleek black car to give wax a ride. in bilming, he traded his harmonica with wayne for a rat named sir squeekins. since this event, he has been taking good care of sir squeekins.he also showed up to rescue wax from the ocean in a small boat after the explosion of the pewternaut a16. bet with the sorceress of lumar hoid would later go on to visit the planet of lumar,[fn 1] a relative backwater in the cosmere. at some point he informed his friend, the kandra ulaam, of his intentions to visit the planet via letter. still hoping to gain access to aondor, he met with riina, who was living on the planet in the guise the sorceress of the midnight sea. while visiting her island, hoid agreed to a bet with her. riina would be allowed to place him under a curse, and in exchange, if he could successfully break it, he would be granted admission to the elantrians and the ability to use aondor. the curse placed on him stripped him of his sense of humor, sense of style, sense of decorum, sense of purpose, intelligence, and sense of self. in order to break the curse, he would need to return to the central room of the sorceress' ship on her island. as a part of the curse, he was also forbidden from telling anyone any information about his curse, how he had been given it, or how it could be broken. riina finished her casting by sending hoid far away from the midnight sea. during his time here, he likely came into possession of some midnight spores. ""“i once ate an entire watermelon in one sitting. and it gave me diarrhea.”-hoid to tress while under the effects of riina's curse"" while under the effects of this curse, hoid's behavior bore little resemblance to his normal personality. he dressed quite oddly, trying at times to wear every shade of orange he could find, or his red-sequined briefs. he spent time doing things like inventing the card game kings, in which you hold your cards backwards and can see everyone's hand but your own, an invention that lost him many of his possessions. bad jokes and nonsensical ideas filled basically all his time, and he was only very rarely able to think clearly enough to communicate anything meaningful or work to accomplish his goals. he was left with some dim awareness of his situation though, a cruel decision on the part of riina who wanted him aware enough to be horrified by his situation. any attempt to share information about his curse would only start him stuttering and send him back to his normal befuddled state. hoid spent a long time at sea, wandering without apparent progress at breaking his curse. ulaam eventually arrived on the planet and found hoid, but was uninterested in working too hard to free him from his curse, preferring to simply stick close and wait for the problem to resolve itself. the two of them spent at least a year traveling together in this way. eventually hoid would become the cabin boy of the whistlebow. he came into contact with charlie, son of the duke of diggen's point and returned there to give tress a ceramic cup and charlie's first letter to her. later, he was traded for by fort for a large sum on the orders of captain crow who was interested in hoid once she had heard that he had been cursed by the sorceress. hoid settled onto a routine onto the crow's song, working as a cabin boy there as well, and kept fed despite his near-uselessness by fort. ulaam continued as his companion, and the two were suffered by the crew despite their oddities, due in part to ulaam's skill with medicine. during his time on the crow's song, hoid gave midnight spores to weev, the ship's sprouter, believing them to be licorice. another of his shipmates, tress, became interested in hoid's past after ulaam explained to her that hoid had been cursed, and approached him on the deck of the ship to try to obtain information about the sorcess despite his curse. hoid was unable to say much of note, but he dimly realized she was trying to help him and was able to offer some cryptic clues, asking tress to bring him to her planet so he could save her, meaning the map of lumar present on the sorceress's ship. he also told her to look for a grouping of six stars, a carving under her bed, which would lead her to weev's secret supply of midnight aether. after tress recovered the midnight aether, ulaam confronted hoid, asking if he had given the aether to her. ulaam and tress continued to press hoid for information and he was able to tell them to look for a person that is not a person and could talk when they should not, which they realized referred to charlie in his guise of huck the rat. as the crow's song continued its journey into the crimson sea, hoid continued to stymie tress's attempts to wheedle more information out of him, unable to point at words on a sheet of paper that might be relevant to his curse. however, tress realized that he she could glean information from his silences though, as he stopped speaking when the subject turned to the matter of his curse. this allowed him to indicate to her where riina's island might be found on a map. as they traveled closer to the midnight sea, huck convinced the addled hoid to dump much of the ship's food and water overboard, in an unsuccessful attempt to force the crew to return the to emerald sea. later when the crow's song reached the sorceress's island, the ship's crew carried hoid into the sorceress's ship to save tress and huck, who had realized that bringing hoid to the center of the sorceress's power would break the curse, and hopefully allow him to defeat her. when hoid entered the tower, the terms of the bet were fulfilled and he was restored to his sense and transformed into an elantrian. hoid arrived just in time to use aondor to throw up a shield and prevent riina from cursing tress. in the brief confrontation that followed, riina judged that she was not confident enough that she could defeat hoid to risk a direct confrontation with him, instead choosing to flee the planet and let hoid, tress, and charlie go free. while hoid was unable to directly remove the curse on charlie, he was able to tweak the parameters so that charlie could break the curse himself once he returned to diggen's point with tress. hoid may have lingered with them for some time giving charlie some pointers on storytelling and music. hoid would later share his adventure with tress and charlie as a story to an unknown audience, potentially made up of people from the planet first of the sun. it is unknown exactly when he tells this story relative to the events, but it is known to be within years or decades, but less than centuries. frozen on komashi at some point, he went with design to komashi and was almost instantly frozen in place, unable to move. this was due to the protection measures that he instituted to prevent other entities from interfering with his investiture after recovering from odium's destruction of his breaths. it activated as, immediately upon his arrival, the father machine attempted to absorb his investiture to power itself. seeing his state, design spraypainted him copper and used him as a coatrack in her new noodle shop, the noodle pupil. at some point following his stasis, he formed a connection with painter, yumi, and liyun allowing him to tell what they were doing, feeling, and thinking, along with many others on the planet, though he felt it with them particularly acutely, and knew it had something to do with him. after the father machine was destroyed by yumi, and the attempts to absorb his investiture thus halted, he was freed from his stasis. he planned with design to disguise themselves as astronauts and steal a ship, allowing them to travel to the nearby iron seven waystation. he kept in contact with nikaro, yumi, and masaka, via letters and inquiries, allowing him to keep up with their lives and how society coped with the loss of the shroud. he would eventually tell the story of yumi and painter to an unknown audience on roshar, with permission from those involved. it is possible that hoid had been to komashi at some point before the activation of the father machine, as he had some implied familiarity with some elements of torish culture. meeting with sigzil when hoid's apprentice sigzil arrived on canticle, sigzil's spren auxiliary used some investiture they had acquired to temporarily reinforce sigzil's connection to hoid, allowing hoid to appear before sigzil as an illusion. sigzil remained angry with hoid for the betrayal, feeling as if he had been tricked and used by wit when he was asked to take up the dawnshard, and forced into his life of fleeing the night brigade. he confronted hoid in anger for this and his betrayal in the warcamps. hoid responded by explaining to sigzil that he had taken him on as an apprentice due to his hunger for answers to all his questions. hoid reminded sigzil that while that it was a good instict, it's important to realize that the questions are more important than the answers themselves sometimes. as the connection faded, hoid apologized sincerely to sigzil for his mistake, and for ruining his life. relationships due to his nature as a worldhopper, hoid has met most of the main characters in the cosmere, as well as a large quantity of side characters. the shards hoid's relationships with the various vessels are varied, to say the least, ranging from hate and terror to respect and cameraderie. cosmere-wide ""“hoid has too many issues to count. i wouldn’t trouble yourself with his situation. he’s nearly as deft at untying knots as he is at creating them. ”-ulaam to tress on hoid"" roshar in

Han ShuXen,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Han_ShuXen,"han shuxen is a painter from the rose empire on sel. his paintings are well-known and extremely valuable in the empire. he painted the masterpiece lily of the spring pond for a woman he loved. on her death, her children gave the painting to the rose empire; it is owned by the arbiter frava. however, shuxen felt that the painting should not outlive its intended recipient and did not want it used to glorify the rose empire. he hired the forger wan shailu, whom he had tutored in her youth, to destroy it and replace it with a copy. shai felt that she owed a debt to her former mentor and agreed to the plan. shuxen assists shai in making a masterful copy of lily of the spring pond, providing his studies for the original painting and advice on the brushwork. shai also makes a second copy of passable quality that she uses as a decoy. shai is able to execute the plan and burns the original painting, replacing it with the master forgery. in his old age he has gone blind and can barely move. - images of han notes[edit]"
Zu (Sel),https://coppermind.net/wiki/Zu_(Sel),"zu is a striker from mulla'dil in the rose empire on sel. he is the captain of the guard in the rose palace. appearance and personality[edit] zu is a young, tall man with a lean musculature and pale skin. he has dark hair which he keeps styled, indicating that he does not usually wear a helmet. he has wide lips. he is an ambitious man who fancies himself bound for important things in the future. he is simpleminded but very useful when the arbiters need someone killed. he is uncomfortable with forgery. history[edit] zu was one of the guards ordered to bring wan shailu before the five arbiters of the heritage faction after she was captured. he showed a great dislike for shai, promising that he would eventually kill her; he felt insecure about his failure to apprehend her when she stole from the rose palace. after shai learned that emperor ashravan was comatose, zu was assigned to oversee the security of her room. he was the only striker who knew of ashravan's injury and the deal that the arbiters struck with shai to create an essence mark that would revive him. he personally guarded the arbiters that came to visit shai's room. once shai completed her work on the emperor's soul, zu came into her room, dismissed the guards inside, then tried to kill her. he managed to wound shai with his sword, but he then fell through the floor due to a trap previously set by shai, injuring his forehead and falling unconscious. when he woke up, he went to the bloodsealer employed by the arbiters and they managed to track shai again using the blood on his sword. however, shai easily bested zu in combat using her shaizan essence mark, breaking his wrist and six of his ribs. he was amazed at her ability. she stole his tall, white, gurish warhorse during her escape from the palace; it was worth more than a small house in some parts of the rose empire. notes[edit]"
Frava,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Frava,"frava is the seniormost arbiter and leader of the heritage faction of the rose empire on sel. during the time of emperor ashravan's reign, she was accounted the second most powerful person in the empire. appearance and personality[edit] frava has a sharp, nasal voice, long fingers, a long face, and moved with grace. she rarely smiled. she maintains a long standing rivalry with gaotona, and has attempted to remove him from his position in the past. she is confrontational, manipulative, and tends to take the initiative. history[edit] during the illness of ashravan, frava extorts wan shailu into providing notes on the creation of the soulstamp for her own soulforgers to try and replicate. it is possible that frava has connections with the underworld of the imperial seat, and enough influence to put people of her choosing in positions of influence among their ranks. she offered such a position to shai, though it is suspected she did not intend to honor the deal. frava curates the imperial gallery, and her offices are adjacent to it. she owns several notable pieces of artwork, one of which shai replaces and destroys as a favour to han shuxen. trivia[edit] - frava seems to be named after the concept of - from the zoroastrian faith. this is backed by brandon actively being influenced by ancient zoroastrian words for rose empire names. notes[edit]"
Ashravan,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ashravan,"ashravan of the eighty suns is the forty-ninth emperor of the rose empire on sel and a member of the heritage faction. at the time of his injury he is forty years old. appearance and personality[edit] ashravan has a ""strong face."" he also has golden hair, a firm chin, and a prominent nose. - images of ashravan despite being known to have a temper, he is a humble man and an idealist at heart. he loves to write terrible poetry and enjoys a good debate. he is arrogant, but secretly wishes he could be something other than what he became. he hates fish but does enjoy hearing himself give speeches. history[edit] early life[edit] when ashravan was six, his brother died. he idolized his brother, but kept his feelings secret due to a belief that his brother would have made a better emperor. his brother's fondness for green was part of the reason that it was ashravan's favorite color. at some point ashravan began to keep a private journal, perhaps to reflect on the choices he made. he left instructions to have it burned upon his death. life as emperor[edit] ""“i have decided, at long last, to agree to the demands of my faction. i will offer myself for the position of emperor, as gaotona has so often encouraged. ”-excerpt from ashravan's personal journal"" after the death of emperor yazad, ashravan is chosen to lead the empire. according to gaotona, ashravan originally became emperor out of a desire to change parts of the empire such as the favoritism shown to the grands. over time, however, his desire waned. ashravan was swept up in the bureaucracy of an empire that worked, if not perfectly, then well enough. he focused more on the beauty of it all instead of its problems, and gave the arbiters more and more control. the urgings of his mentor gaotona were a significant factor in his becoming emperor, and ashravan eventually grew to resent gaotona because he felt inadequate. the emperor's new soul[edit] one night, a group of assassins, agents of the glory faction, broke into the emperor's rooms and attacked him and his wife, kurshina. kurshina was killed, and ashravan sustained a severe injury to the head. although a resealer was able to heal the wound, the emperor was left brain-dead. the arbiters of the heritage faction kept the emperor's status a secret by saying he had sequestered himself during the mourning period for his wife. the arbiters then tasked the forger wan shailu to create a powerful soulstamp known as an essence mark to rewrite the soul of the emperor before the one hundred days of mourning were over. shai used a number of sources for the soul forgery, such as official histories, ashravan's personal journal and interviews of his friends and family. the arbiter gaotona volunteered himself as a test subject for stamps of minor portions of ashravan's soul. on the ninety-eighth day of the mourning period, shai succeeded in creating a soulstamp that replicated ashravan's original soul with which he would have to be re-stamped each day. she snuck into his rooms and stamped him, waking him and restoring his mind. ashravan allowed shai to escape his rooms. later he spoke with gaotona and figured out, in the course of the conversation, what had been wrong with him. he then addressed the arbiters, laying to rest the rumors of his illness and promising to seek justice for his wife's murder. buried in the stamp, however, were also certain triggers that shai had added to help nudge ashravan into becoming the emperor he had always dreamed of being, causing him in the next years to pore over his old journals and rediscover his old ideals. trivia[edit] - ashravan seems to be named after the concept of - from the zoroastrian faith. this is backed by brandon actively being influenced by ancient zoroastrian words for rose empire names. notes[edit]"
Grand,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Grand,"the grands are a race on sel that rule the rose empire. characteristics[edit] grands typically had longer than average lifespans, able to function and continue work into their nineties. grands also tend to have long fingers and long features. the most current fashion among the grands was wearing robes or wraps after an ancient style. grands are also typically treated by the empire with extreme favoritism. the grands tend to be rather ignorant about the other races in the empire. while strikers are regarded well by the grands and often promoted, the grands still see them as inferior, and even changed their names from the original of mulla'dil to strikers. they see the maipon people as the same as the jindo people despite the fact that the two groups diverged long ago. grands also have a deep-seated fear of forgery. while they tolerate rememberers, and resealers to heal people, forgery of the soul is an abomination to them. the grands tell tales of forgers as witches; saying they use soulstamps to place seals on the bottoms of people's feet to change their personalities and harm their minds. this leads to most grands being totally ignorant about how forgery works. governmental positions[edit] the grands held all the most important governmental positions, which were awarded based on who passed tests to serve in the government. grands who served the government wore robes of certain colors to show rank; blue and green for minor functionaries. when grands receive positions in the government, the person who gets the job is usually determined by who gives the most bribes or who is well connected, with little consideration for competence. when grands serve in the government, they usually belong to one of eighty factions, such as the heritage faction or the glory faction. each faction is led by five arbiters. the emperor typically delegates tasks to his own faction's five arbiters, who hold significant governmental authority. notable grands[edit] - emperor - arbiter - arbiter - arbiter - arbiter notes[edit]"
Shattered Plains,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Warcamp,"the shattered plains are a region of roshar located on the border of the frostlands and unclaimed hills, in the former territory of the silver kingdom of natanatan. they are named for their topography, consisting of a huge number of plateaus of various sizes surrounded on all sides by deep chasms. it is unknown what caused the landscape to break in this way, but during one of kaladin's dreams in which he flew with a highstorm, he saw the entire area as a symmetrical pattern, radiating outwards from the center as if something massive had struck there. topography[edit] the western edge is ringed by ten circular craters. each crater's ridges have been worn away by highstorms where they connect to the shattered plains themselves. it is noted by dalinar that from above, it is clear that the craters are the remains of large domes. the edge of the plains consists of smaller plateaus with chasms ranging generally from 50 to 150 feet in depth. these westernmost plateaus can be bridged easily, and many permanent bridges have been constructed joining them together. moving eastward, the plains become much more varied in size and the chasms themselves can become much wider, making crossing from one to another much more challenging. the eastern edge of the shattered plains is so weathered by storms that it consists mostly of spindly pillars of rock, making it impassable. on the eastern side of the explored portion of the plains is a particularly large plateau known as ""the tower"". the tower is a favored location for chasmfiends to pupate. highstorms are particularly bad on the shattered plains, garnering the moniker 'the stormlands', as there is no shelter on top of the plateaus, and the chasms often flood. the plains are also on the eastern side of roshar, where the highstorms are strongest. for these reasons, getting caught in a highstorm on the plains is a death sentence. some accounts describe the plains as looking as if something enormous had struck the center, causing the fracturing plains to radiate symmetrically in all directions. claims of lights in the center plateau were the parshendi live have also been recorded. the ruins of stormseat are in the center of the shattered plains. the oathgate is located there on a circular plateau. the oathgate had been hidden underneath centuries of built-up crem. the city of stormseat did not encompass the whole of the shattered plains, but had satellite cities and outbuildings. flora and fauna[edit] the shattered plains has a large variety of plants and animals, the most dangerous of which is its apex predator: the chasmfiend. however, shallan davar believes the alethi have hunted chasmfiends nearly to extinction for their enormous gemhearts. the climate is moister than it is the west. plants have a tendency not to pull into their shells as swiftly after a storm. clouds are less frequent; alternating between sun and highstorms. outside the warcamps, rockbuds, knobweed, flowering branzah, prickletac, pink and purple fingermoss, and other grasses are known to grow. due to the harsh weather, the grasses near the shattered plains are typically yellow in color and only grow to 6-10 inches in height. during shallan's travels to the shattered plains, she notices feral axehounds, small eels living in ponds, and white trees with red leaves. there is also a small, tentacled, animal that lives in pools near the warcamps, called a grasper. out on the plateaus themselves, rockbuds, moss, and shalebark are the most common plants. shallan notes that the moss and common flowering rockbuds grow in similar patterns. within the chasms is a different environment all together. the chasms are more humid and damp than the rest of the plains, with stagnant pools where cremling larvae grow. haspers, mosses, fungi, and frillblooms all grow on the walls and in crevasses in the chasms. translucent cremlings have been seen, along with larger carrion animals that are sensitive to light. inhabitants[edit] prior to the war of reckoning, the only known permanent inhabitants of the shattered plains were the listeners, who occupied the ten craters on the western edge of the plains. during the war, the craters were occupied by various alethi armies fighting the parshendi under the vengeance pact. the plains and the surrounding area are so barren that the warcamps are perhaps the only places where it is acceptable to pile refuse up high and allow the highstorm to carry it away, as there is no danger of the trash being carried into another city. listeners[edit] during the war of reckoning, the listeners resided in the ruins of stormseat, which they call narak. after the battle of narak, the alethi claimed the city for themselves. the homes of the listeners are now barracks, and a watchtower has been erected on the tower where 'the five' met. warcamps[edit] the alethi have occupied the crater-like areas of the plains and constructed ten warcamps, a royal palace, and a market. the palace complex includes the royal residence, gallery of maps, feasting basin, and a dueling arena. the warcamps are each a mixture of soulcast buildings, shanties, and tents that are taken down before each highstorm. each camp is self sufficient, with their own markets, taverns, brothels, and spanreed information stations to tashikk. most of the buildings are soulcast using topaz. the bunkers and barracks are typically long and narrow with a smaller end facing the highstorms to the east. the outer market was a collection of buildings outside the warcamps, near the king's palace. the buildings here were mostly constructed of stone quarried from near the plains. it expanded in a sprawling way, without plan or order. it became a place where people from all warcamps mingled and shopped from the thaylen merchants. the market was largely unregulated but was patrolled and administered by kholin scribes. while the warcamps weathered the everstorm quite well, eight of the ten warcamps were evacuated and abandoned after the battle of narak--their occupants either moving to urithiru or disappearing into the unclaimed hills. the princedoms from north to south: politics[edit] since the relocation from the shattered plains warcamps to urithiru, ownership of the plains and the oathgate has become extremely important and strategic to the success and survival of the inhabitants of urithiru. urithiru is not self-supporting yet, and resources are required from the warcamps to supply the city. farming operations have begun in the unclaimed hills, but due to the climate, rockbuds grow smaller and crops are less productive than in alethkar. the fused are harrying caravans traveling to the oathgate. the natans want ownership of the shattered plains and the oathgate. elhokar proposed that dalinar be made high king of urithiru and the shattered plains. trivia[edit] - the shattered plains was originally envisioned as existing on the world of - , - homeworld and the site of the - , until brandon moved it to roshar in the redrafting of the way of kings. - the listener - claims that the shattered plains were not shattered by the - . notes[edit]"
Jezrien,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Yaysi,"""“we chose this burden willingly. well, we can choose to drop it if we wish. ”-jezrien on the oathpact"" jezrien, also known as jezerezeh'elin, yaezir and yaysi, was one of the ten heralds of the almighty and the patron of the order of windrunners. jezrien fought in multiple desolations, defending mankind from the voidbringers and returning to damnation between desolations to be tortured. after centuries of combat, jezrien abandoned the oathpact with eight of the other heralds, pretending the voidbringers had been defeated once and for all. he went into hiding, gradually losing his mind, while the rest of the world revered his memory and he became a figure of legend over the following millennia. appearance and personality[edit] appearance[edit] jezrien has dark eyes and black hair. he is tall and appears almost alethi, although his skin is a little darker than a typical alethi man and his features are slightly off. as a herald, jezrien appears to be about thirty years old and wore a short, neatly-trimmed black beard. he stands confidently with a royal bearing. he often wears fine white and blue clothing, although it is oftentimes stained and charred by battle. he speaks with a deep, calm voice that has a regal sound to it. after he abandoned the oathpact and started living as a beggar, jezrien's beard grew long and scraggly, streaked with black and gray. his hair became matted and filthy and he smelled like garbage. jezrien's clothes are reduced to ragged scraps. his words are often slurred or believed to be gibberish. personality[edit] ""“better that one man should suffer than ten. ”-jezrien's response to taln's abandonment"" jezrien is widely believed to have been one of the best men to have ever lived. upon joining the oathpact, he was an honorable and true man. jezrien's specialty was leadership; he was a great instructor on the guidance of men. he is a man willing to admit his mistakes and make common cause with those that had been his enemies. after centuries of torture, jezrien became damaged by anguish and grief. he was afraid to return to braize and face the torments of the voidbringers again. this led jezrien to make the choice to abandon the oathpact and leave taln alone on braize. he had even reached such a point that he was willing to lie to the surviving humans that he and the other heralds had achieved final victory. he seemed distraught by his own cowardice at the ending of the oathpact and ashamed of leaving taln to suffer. in the millennia that followed, he succumbed to insanity. by the era of solitude, jezrien's once sharp mind had been dulled thoroughly. he spoke nonsensically and without any clear meaning behind his words. he seemed to have some semblance of lucidity, referencing the various unmade, but it is uncertain how much awareness he had. he appeared to speak gibberish at times, but it is possible that he is speaking in an ancient language, such as the dawnchant. attributes and abilities[edit] ""“the heralds glow like the sun, wield the honorblades, and speak with the voices of a thousand trumpets. they could cast down buildings with a command, force the storms to obey, and heal with a touch. ”-shallan davar's thoughts on the heralds"" herald of kings[edit] as jezrien served as the herald of kings, it is likely jezrien was one of the best leaders and instructors of leadership that has ever lived; he trained mankind's leaders upon his return before each desolation. as one of the heralds of the almighty, it is nearly impossible to truly kill jezrien. in truth, the jezrien that exists now is a cognitive shadow. before breaking the oathpact, upon his death he was returned to damnation to be tortured, with his immortal body being constantly restored. judging by the abilities of the other heralds, he possesses superhuman reflexes and strength. even after abandoning the oathpact, jezrien remains ageless, and appears as youthful as the day he became a herald. his immortality is not impregnable, however. jezrien was sealed away by vyre's knife into a gemstone. according to kalak, once jezrien was sealed, his connection to the other heralds was severed; as a result, his soul decomposed into an ordinary soul with no valid connection to the spiritual or physical realms. over the weeks he faded into the beyond, at last truly dying. shardwielding and surgebinding[edit] as a herald, jezrien possessed an honorblade, a variety of shardblade given to him by the shard honor. this shardblade is able to cut through any material, stone, steel, or even living things effortlessly. this allowed jezrien to be a formidable foe on the battlefield, particularly against thunderclasts, as his blade can cut their stone bodies with ease. as he had spent an enormous amount of time using the honorblade in the fight against the voidbringers, jezrien is very experienced in using his blade and his skill at dueling can only be matched by the other heralds. unlike most shardblades, this honorblade also granted jezrien access to the surges of adhesion and gravitation. as he was not sworn to a spren, he was able to do with his blade what he liked, without regard for any oaths. however, the fact that his powers were not granted by a nahel bond prevented him from having squires. jezrien also had no need for stormlight, as his surgebinding was powered directly by honor. it is unknown how this would have been impacted by honor's death. since giving up his honorblade when he gave up the oathpact, jezrien is unable to surgebind. history[edit] herald of the almighty[edit] ""“do not consider it an honor. a duty, yes, but not an honor. ”-jezrien to nale on joining the oathpact"" jezrien was likely born on ashyn. at some point in the past jezrien ruled as a king. it is unknown if jezrien was ever married but had at least one child, shalash. he and nale spent some time on opposite sides of a conflict, but jezrien ultimately came to the conclusion that he had been in the wrong. after mankind began to lose its fight against odium's immortal fused, jezrien and ishar formed a plan to counter this threat. jezrien invited nale to join them, believing that nale's honor was above reproach. jezrien and nine companions asked honor for the ability to seal the voidbringers on braize. honor agreed, the oathpact was founded, and jezrien and his nine companions became heralds of the almighty and were given their honorblades. jezrien was tortured with the rest of the heralds between every desolation until one of them broke. when that happened, jezrien and the other heralds returned to roshar to guide mankind in the fight against the voidbringers. jezrien would aid their leaders in learning how to effectively guide their peoples. when the spren began to bond with humans to grant them surgebinding, jezrien became the patron of the windrunners, the order of the knights radiant that bore the same powers as jezrien. aharietiam[edit] ""“i will lead the charge for the tranquiline halls. you will not see me again, but think not on that now! you have won your peace. revel in it! rebuild. go now, help your fellows. carry with you the light of your herald king’s words. we are victorious, at long last, over evil! ”-jezrien to the survivors of aharietiam"" many desolations after the beginning of the oathpact, jezrien and the other heralds save for talenel, who had died, decided that they could no longer withstand the torture they faced in between desolations. they agreed to abandon their oaths, leaving taln alone in damnation. jezrien was chosen by the rest to wait and see if kalak had survived and to pass on word to him of their decision. after explaining their decision to kalak, jezrien summoned his honorblade and left it stuck point-first into the ground, before heading off by himself. era of solitude and the true desolation[edit] ""“praise yaezir, herald of kings. may he lead in wisdom. if he ever stops drooling. ”-nale's mention of jezrien to the viziers of azir"" following the abandonment of his blade, jezrien spread the word of their victory to the survivors of the last desolation. while jezrien was never killed and returned to damnation after aharietiam, avoiding death for four and a half millennia, he seems to have succumbed to the same madness plaguing the other heralds. jezrien became a drunk beggar who lived in a beggars' porch in the kholinar palace. he was known as ahu by then, and was occasionally the drinking companion of highprince dalinar kholin when dalinar was trying to drink clandestinely or could not find more alcohol. jezrien attended the beggar's feast on the night that king gavilar kholin was assassinated, speaking incoherently to szeth before collapsing. six years later, after the capture of kholinar by the voidbringers, jezrien was stabbed by moash with a raysium knife. jezrien was initially unfazed by the wound, but quickly realized that he had been mortally wounded, screaming and dying quite suddenly, his soul transferred into the gem. at the moment of jezrien's sealing, his connection with the other heralds was broken and caused them to feel a painful tearing sensation and they all knew that he was dead. while the fused were initially successful in trapping jezrien's soul, their plan ultimately failed. with the oathpact severed and honor splintered, jezrien's soul could not exist long without his body. within weeks his mind had faded and he was truly gone, destroying the oathpact in the process. culture[edit] ""“you call him the stormfather, here in alethkar, or jezerezeh'elin. he was king of the heralds. master of the storms, bringer of water and life, known for his fury and his temper, but also for his mercy. ”-sigzil on jezrien"" over the millennia that have passed since aharietiam jezrien has become mythologized across roshar. he is known as one of the greatest humans to have ever lived. in the vorin kingdoms of the east, jezrien has been conflated with the concept of the stormfather, so many believe them to be one and the same. he has come to be known as jezerezeh'elin, the herald of kings, and men swear by his name and burn glyphwards in prayer to him. he is associated with the number jes, the essence zephyr, the gemstone sapphire, and the divine attributes protecting and leading. he is commonly depicted in art and sculpture with the other nine heralds. in some cases, when a serious crime is committed, men may be strung out during a highstorm to be judged by jezrien. if they survive, they were innocent, although men typically do not survive the highstorm. vorin people who have interacted more directly with the stormfather have come to realize that the two are not one and the same. ""“[the emuli] worship jezrien, though they don’t accept him as a figure from the vorin religion. they name him the only god. ”-teft about emul"" in emul, jezrien is worshipped as their only god, possibly under the name prime kadasix. they hold that he named their kingdom as well as its capital, sesemalex dar. in azir and the other makabaki kingdoms, jezrien is known as yaezir, kadasix of kings. they believe that each new prime aqasix is chosen by the will of yaezir, and that he will guide them in their search for the person he has already ordained to be the prime. the iriali and rirans also revere jezrien on some level, calling him yaysi. trivia[edit] - jezrien's portrait used in the chapter arches is called the king by the - staff. - there is a winehouse in urithiru named - after jezrien. notes[edit]"
Iri,https://coppermind.net/wiki/One,"""“we are iriali, and part of the long trail, of which this is the fourth land. … eventually, all will be gathered back in-when the seventh land is attained-and we will once again become one. ”-ym"" iri is a kingdom in northwestern roshar. prior to the recreance, it was one of the silver kingdoms. people from iri are called iriali. iri is ruled by three monarchs, currently two kings and a queen. the iriali queen has authority over foreign policy. geography and ecology[edit] the largest city in iri is rall elorim, city of shadows, followed closely by kasitor. many people in kasitor worship cusicesh the protector, a giant spren, as a deity. iri also contains the city of eila. due to its northwestern position on roshar, iri is warmer than most other nations. history[edit] the iriali are not native to roshar. they believe that they are part of something they call the ""long trail,"" a series of seven lands which all must be ""attained"" before they will become one again. of these, the fourth land is roshar, which they migrated to from somewhere besides ashyn, separately from the rest of humanity. they have had what most would consider to be inhuman ancestry in their past, depending on what is considered human. during the desolations the silver kingdom of iri was founded. this kingdom ruled the current territories of iri and rira. at some point the kingdom collapsed and the eastern part split off, forming rira. iri continued to claim rira as a vassal, but that claim was disputed. during the true desolation, dalinar kholin approached the monarchs of iri in an attempt to persuade them to join the coalition of monarchs. iri claimed both that dalinar had stolen their shardplate and that alethkar was no longer relevant as a world power. they gave these as reasons not to side with the coalition, instead joining forces with the fused, who offered them more power than they felt they could gain by siding with the humans. furthermore, the iriali people sought peace. looking back at their histories, they realized that humans had never tried the tactic of capitulation as a way to avoid a desolation and felt an obligation to try it, as it was an experience the one had not yet explored. by the time just after the battle of thaylen field, iri had struck eastward and, with the help of odium's forces, captured most of the western kingdoms in the region of the purelake. the country became both a stationing ground for troops and the center to which odium's navy retreated following a defeat by the coalition. politics[edit] the iriali are ruled by a triumvirate of rulers. the gender of the ruler is apparently unimportant, though currently they are ruled by two kings and a queen. the queen currently has responsibilities over foreign policy. the nation of iri claims authority over their ""sister nation"" of rira, but rira disputes that claim. culture[edit] the iriali have metallic golden-blond skin and hair that breeds true. many alethi consider a lock of the golden hair of the iriali to be good luck. the iriali are particular about chastity laws, and dislike public nudity. the men often wear only waist wraps on warmer days. the iriali also paint their skin with colors and patterns. the iriali tend to be less quarrelsome and prudish than the vorin nations. they mostly have yellow eyes. iri has no soulcasters. religion[edit] the iriali worship a god they call ""the one"". according to this belief, the one knew everything but had experienced nothing. and so the one became many in order to experience all things. as each experience is different, it brings completeness to the one. eventually, all will be gathered back in when the sum of land is attained and they will once again become one. every person is a different mind of a single being experiencing different lives. as many, they need ignorance. each fragment of the one’s mind has its own body with different passions and inclinations. they exist in variety to experience all kinds of thought. that means some people must know and others must not. just like some people must be rich and others poor. it is likely that this belief is the same one spread by arclo. the religion is at least somewhat related to the shattering of adonalsium with its philosophy of one becoming many. the iriali religion involves somehow reading portents of the future in the waves of the ocean. tidereaders look at the waves and use what they see to make pronouncements about the future. the iriali queen has a tidereader in her court. the philosophy behind the one is that the spiritual realm and the beyond are the same thing. when a person dies, their soul rejoins the investiture of the spiritual realm. most cosmere philosophers disagree with this belief. notable citizens & visitors[edit] -

Safehand,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Safehand,"safehand is a rosharan term for a woman's left hand. according to cultural tradition in the vorin kingdoms, it is improper for a woman to leave her safehand uncovered. a woman's right hand is often referred to as their freehand. background and observance[edit] the modern view on safehands derives from the ancient book arts and majesty, which claimed that ""true"" feminine pursuits and arts were the ones that could be performed with one hand, while ""manly"" arts were the ones performed with two hands, thus tying delicacy with women and brute force with men. the tradition of covering one's safehand is primarily practiced by women in the vorin nations of alethkar, jah keved, kharbranth, new natanan, and thaylenah. girls begin covering their left hand at around twelve years of age, and it is seen as a rite of passage. it is kept hidden from view whenever possible, even when wearing a robe in front of bathing attendants before actually entering the bath. only family members are touched with a covered safehand, as it is considered to be a fairly intimate gesture. intentionally showing your safehand is considered an exceptionally private act, usually reserved only for a woman's significant other. covering the left hand is not thought of as a major inconvenience among alethi and veden nobility, since lighteyed women are able to pursue one-handed hobbies such as painting and writing. among the upper class, the most common method of covering the safehand is by wearing a havah, a traditional dress that includes an oversized sleeve that loosely covers the left hand. the fabric used to make havahs is thin enough that the safehand can still be used to grip things. the sleeve often has a compartment or button where a ""safepouch"" that holds personal objects can be placed. the pouch may hold objects as large as a notebook, and can usually be transferred between different garments. it is considered extremely rude to open another woman's safepouch. the sleeve typically has a button that can be opened if a woman is in a situation where she can reveal her safehand. havahs are particularly popular in alethkar and jah keved, and new styles are often introduced in roshar's fashion capitals of liafor and yezier. people from non-vorin nations who associate with alethi nobility (such as evi and palona) are expected to cover their safehands, although they may be relatively careless about keeping it totally hidden. darkeyed women often choose to wear a glove instead of a sleeve; they are not concerned about putting on airs and are more likely to need both hands to perform their jobs or household duties. thaylen women, who are less devout than the alethi and come from a society of sailors, also typically wear gloves. gloves are considered less modest than sleeves. prostitutes may wear fingerless gloves or leave their safehands completely uncovered in order to be provocative and show others who they are before being hired out. history[edit] although arts and majesty was written prior to the recreance, it came to prominence after that event when it was adopted as a misogynistic justification for men to bear shardblades and shardplate instead of women. this had far-reaching effects in vorin society, including women appropriating the duties of reading and writing as a form of retaliation. this change occurred relatively rapidly, over the course of a few decades, and persisted for several millenia. singers that served vorin masters in slaveform prior to the everstorm sometimes retained the tradition of covering their safehands after they were freed. during the true desolation, the importance of safehands seemed to decline among some high-ranking vorin women. jasnah kholin followed the tradition because it was seen as proper, although she did not actually care about it herself. navani began wearing a glove more often and felt that wearing a sleeve was burdensome. trivia[edit] - according to - , it was not originally intended for safehands to become a sexual and nudity taboo. after the release of - , however, fans made the connection themselves and brandon worked it into the world as a result. notes[edit]"
Zu (Roshar),https://coppermind.net/wiki/Zu_(Roshar),"""“might as well give it a last hurrah! ”-zu"" zu is an iriali stoneward on roshar bonded to ua'pam. appearance and personality[edit] zu has golden hair and bronze skin that seems metallic. she wears traditional clothing: a wrap around the chest (like a warrior's sarashi) with loose flowing trousers and a thick coat. she prefers her shardblade to be long and slender, with a wicked curve. zu is eager and excitable. she is also blunt and to the point, yet playful. she has a strong relationship with ua'pam, hugging him as they enter shadesmar. he often preaches precaution, which she ignores to playfully unnerve him. abilities and attributes[edit] zu speaks alethi well. she is more skilled with weaponry and stealth than her account of her past allows. she has the gracefulness of an edgedancer. surgebinding[edit] as a stoneward, zu has the ability to manipulate the surges of tension and cohesion through her nahel bond with her peakspren. the surge of cohesion gives her the ability to reshape stone. the surge of tension gives her the ability to control the hardness of an object allowing her to harden clothing into weapons. history[edit] early life[edit] zu was turned out by her people when her powers manifested because they did not know she was a radiant, instead believing she was cursed by a god. she fled to the reshi isles to avoid people making rules about how she should live. while there, she worked as a guide, giving her brief combat experience. mission to lasting integrity[edit] in 1175, zu was chosen to go on a diplomatic mission to lasting integrity to try to convince more honorspren to bond with humans. as the group was preparing to leave, she was intrigued by adolin explaining to godeke about all of the types of swords he was bringing. she summoned ua'pam to show him why a shardblade was superior and told him he should become a radiant. they transferred to shadesmar from an oathgate control building, and zu immediately leaped up and grabbed ua'pam in a hug. when adolin tried to introduce her to maya, zu deflected his question about her past and went to look around. once on unativi's barge, zu liked to spend time in conversation with the other peakspren. she and ua'pam made arrangements for the group to camp outside of nameless when the barge landed there. she frequently scouted ahead of the group as they traveled. zu pointed out to adolin that the tukari caravan was still keeping pace behind them after they passed the crossroads. she blithely suggested to adolin that the two of them go confront the group, using their remaining stormlight in the encounter. ua'pam advised adolin not to encourage her, and she genially rejoined her spren and went back to the camp. ""“""your people are trying to ride it."" ""my people are storming stupid.""”-godeke and zu"" when adolin and the radiants discussed their approach to the honorspren, zu admitted that she had no patience for politics and would simply tell them they were ""being storming stupid"" for thinking they could remain out of the conflict. zu was caught by surprise when adolin figured out that the tukari tailing them were actually after notum, but she went to his aid with the others as quickly as she could. when they finally approached lasting integrity and adolin reported to the group that he, shallan, maya, and pattern were going to have to enter without them, zu protested that she didn't like the idea of splitting up. afterwards, she and ua'pam returned with arshqqam, dreaming-though-awake, and adolin's soldiers to apprise dalinar of the situation. notes[edit]"

images of drehy history[edit] drehy was on bridge four when kaladin began trying to save the men. he was among the first to defend kaladin, even while the others taunted him. while the crew was in the chasms scavenging, kaladin talks with rock, teft, and dunny, and with prompting, drehy talks a little as well. when they were being taught to wield the spear by kaladin, drehy, along with skar, learned almost as quickly as moash did. he was also among the first bridgemen that kaladin trained in first aid, along with rock and skar. after seeing sadeas abandon dalinar in the battle of the tower, drehy remarks that it makes him sick. when shocked by kaladin's display of his abilities, drehy swears by the brightcaller's rays and a little later speculates that kaladin is a spren rather than a man. drehy joins the guard of dalinar and takes turns guarding the kholins along with the rest of the former members of bridge four, under kaladin's leadership. he helps train the bridgemen from other crews as well. kaladin sends a message to teft requesting more men in the training arena because drehy and moash had been working too many hours. during dinner in the bridge four barracks one night, drehy flips a chunk of stewed longroot at lopen after the herdazian claimed he was ready for anything. as the alethi armies approach the center plateau, drehy and skar are assigned to guard adolin. after he receives the order to attack, adolin asks the two if they are going to stay behind due to kaladin's aversion to bridgemen participating in battle against the parshendi. drehy insists on fighting, asserting that they're no longer dealing with parshendi. drehy and skar keep up with adolin during the battle. at one point, drehy helps cut the parshendi's ropes from adolin and assures the prince that the parshendi will send real attacks against him eventually. drehy and skar save adolin from falling off the plateau and a little later help him get his armor off when it loses most of its stormlight. drehy is selected by among the best of bridge four by teft to assist adolin and shallan for their battle against the unmade re-shephir in the heart of urithiru. drehy plays a fairly important role in the battle, standing in front of shallan at one point and stabbing one of the creatures of re-shephir through the head with his spear. during a meeting between sigzil and kaladin, sigzil informs kaladin that drehy has been courting a man named dru from the market district and asks if drehy needs to fill out forms for social reassignment. kaladin tells sigzil that no such form exists for the alethi. when rock sets out with other members of bridge four to see what has become of rock's family that was traveling to urithiru by way of the shattered plains, they discover the caravan was attacked and drehy notes that it was the work of the voidbringers. drehy was chosen, along with skar, by kaladin to be part of the group that traveled to kholinar to get an update on the city. this choice by kaladin shows that with the absence of moash, drehy was regarded as one of the better fighters among bridge four. during the trip to kholinar, drehy flew using lashings, meaning that he has the powers of a windrunner squire. during the infiltration and subsequent battle of kholinar, drehy played a vital role. as one of the better warriors of the group, drehy helped guard shallan and adolin throughout their time in kholinar and also helped kaladin during the battle of the palace to push back the enemy. when shallan began her way to the oathgate to battle the unmade, drehy was sent by kaladin to assist her and keep the palace guard and the fused away from her while she focused on the unmade. drehy was not of the members of the group to travel to the shadesmar, instead remaining in kholinar with skar to attempt to continue the battle. working on information gained by spanreed, kaladin traveled to a cave on the coast of alethkar. entering the cave kaladin discovers that drehy and skar survived and escaped kholinar with gavinor kholin. they had smeared ash on their foreheads to hide their tattoos, and both looked weak and exhausted from their travels. showing gavinor to kaladin, drehy quotes the second ideal of the windrunners. windrunner[edit] after reuniting with kaladin, drehy bonded a spren of his own. he participated in the evacuation of hearthstone with his fellow windrunners, engaging the fused in combat, before returning to urithiru. skar and drehy travelled with rock and his family to the horneater peaks before returning to the shattered plains for teft's funeral. trivia[edit] - he is a cameo of one of brandon's college friends ryan dreher, who is also gay - he is described as long-limbed and lanky, an in-joke between brandon and ryan - drehy's boyfriend - is possibly a cameo of ryan's husband - he is planned to play a major role in the lunamor novella notes[edit]"

Koravellium Avast,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Koravellium,"""“all things must be cultivated.”-koravellium avast"" koravellium avast, also known as she who brings the dews at dawn and koravari, is the original, and current, vessel of the shard cultivation. appearance and personality[edit] ""“this woman extended into eternity. ”-dalinar"" prior to her ascension, koravellium was a dragon; however, she seems to prefer human form when interacting with others as a shard. when speaking with people, she typically takes on the appearance of a dark-skinned woman with a matronly build, a round face and a full head of black, tightly-curling hair. she wears a sweeping brown dress that seems to meld into the undergrowth, and has a voice described as sounding like tumbling stones. koravellium is calculating and cautious, preferring to set things up from the background than taking action directly, likely thanks to having front-row view of what happens to shards that do fight odium head-on. she is deeply private and secretive, retreating from people and hiding her plans and thoughts from them. this leads to some thinking that she has given up on humanity at large, while in reality she is hiding and planning. when she does interact with people, she is rather curt and self-assured, leaving no room for discussion or doubts, though she can be considerate when need be. she can, however, be kind. she cared deeply for tanavast, and mourned his passing. she isn't opposed to teaching other shards how to use their powers, either. it seems this can be used to fool her, though at the moment, it's unclear how deeply her schemes run. abilities and attributes[edit] koravellium was once capable of transforming between shapes of various species, including those of a human and a giant, scaled beast. being a dragon, she would also be unaging and capable of flight. while presently she can appear as she wishes, her draconic shape is still the ""truest"" one. nonetheless, despite being roshar's only dragon, she prefers to hide this aspect of her nature. as a shard, she is one of the most powerful entities in the cosmere, capable of altering souls through old magic. she has demonstrated the power to manipulate people's memories, alter their levels of intelligence and emotion, and give them abilities such as metabolizing food into lifelight, touching spren, and entering visions. she is capable of creating powerful spren and granting them abilities similar to her own, though the only such creation known to exist is the nightwatcher. as with most shards, koravellium is additionally gifted with potent future sight. while it's better than honor's, it's unclear how she compares to shards like endowment or preservation. history[edit] little is known about koravellium's history prior to the shattering of adonalsium. like all other original vessels, she came from yolen. she and tanavast were a couple. it can be assumed that she was a god figure on yolen, as she was a dragon, a species which were worshipped as gods. she was present at the shattering and took up the shard of cultivation, then departed for the rosharan system with tanavast, now turned honor. relationships[edit] tanavast[edit] ""“she doesn't care any longer. now that he’s gone . . . ”-wyndle"" koravellium and tanavast were once romantically involved, though the specifics of how are unclear. notably, the two share the last five letters of their names, and though it's unlikely to be accidental, it's unclear what, if anything, it means. she publicly withdrew from the matters of spren and roshar after his death, leading some cultivationspren to believe she has wholly given up on humanity. as the stormfather is, in some ways, tanavast's cognitive shadow, he reminds her heavily of him, and she feels about him much the same way as she did about honor. back when he created the visions, tanavast highly respected koravellium's ability to predict the future, calling it far superior to his own. presently, stormfather feels much the same about her as honor used to. it's unknown how often the two interacted since honor's splintering, if at all. taravangian[edit] ""“oh, you wonderful creature. you have no idea what you have done. ”-taravangian"" koravellium engineers taravangian's ascent to odium, giving him the boon that alters his intelligence and empathy to prepare him for bearing the power. she hopes that he could carry it more honorably than rayse, thus putting reins on what she considers to be the most dangerous of the sixteen powers. after taravangian becomes odium, she introduces herself to him and offers to teach him how to use his newfound abilities. cultivation claims that she didn't have the full control over her boon to taravangian, and that she could only hope that he would become someone who wouldn't pose a danger to the whole cosmere once he ascended. in this, she appears to have failed, as taravangian begins to plot a campaign of conquest almost immediately. he intends to use her and her generosity to further his own plans. at the present, it's difficult to tell whether he truly is outwitting her, or if she's aware of what he's doing. nightwatcher[edit] ""“mother wanted a daughter whose shape and personality would grow organically. ”-wyndle"" koravellium created the nightwatcher directly, aiming to make a creature that would grow without the influence of human perception and thought, which is why nightwatcher's point of view can be highly alien for those who interact with her, even other spren. nonetheless, she allows the nightwatcher to interact with humans in limited capacity -- she lets her hold court in the valley, granting petitioners boons and banes through old magic. cultivation keeps a close eye on those exchanges, stepping in when she sees that the nightwatcher is out of her depth, and occasionally granting boons in her stead. hoid[edit] ""“she and i never did get along. ”-hoid about koravellium"" for reasons unknown, hoid and koravellium are on poor terms. he does not seem to think badly of her, but has his own nickname for her -- slammer. how it came about is likewise unknown. trivia[edit] - cultivation's vessel went unnamed until - , where her name was revealed in one of the art pages. - by contrast, both - and - , the other two vessels of rosharan shards, were named in - . - when asked if koravari or koravellium avast were shifted versions of cultivation's original name, brandon did not confirm. - koravellium is the only current vessel to be a dragon. notes[edit]"

Emerald Sea,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Emerald_Sea,"the emerald sea, also known as the verdant sea, is an ocean on lumar. the sea is made up of verdant spores, which drop from the verdant lunagree. like all seas on lumar, it is pentagonal in shape. it borders the crimson sea and rose sea, and three other unknown seas. it might border the sapphire sea, as the sapphire sea is supposedly easy to access from the emerald sea, though this hasn't been confirmed. government[edit] it is ruled over, at least partially, by a figure known as the verdant king. they have a royal navy which tracks down criminals such as deadrunners. the government also has tax collectors and inspectors who have the authority to control the coming and going of ships and cargo through the sea. their government is known to recognize the felony murder rule, wherein, if somebody dies in the committing or furtherance of a dangerous or enumerated crime, the offender and their accomplices are held guilty of murder. notable locations[edit] notable inhabitants of the emerald sea[edit] see also[edit] notes[edit]"
Midnight Sea,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Midnight_Sea,"the midnight sea is an ocean on lumar, made up of midnight aether spores. the only known inhabited land was the sorceress' island, where the sorceress lived until she was driven away by tress and hoid. like all seas on lumar, it is pentagonal in shape. it is notably warm compared to other seas due to taking in large amounts of heat from the sun due to their deep black color. the sound of the seethe apparently is also different from the other seas, but it is not clear if this is a true difference, or merely a psychological effect. the midnight sea is the most dangerous of seas on lumar due to the presence of the sorceress and her midnight essence servants, which hunt those who cross into their domain. these are hard to notice in the liquidized spores, as they as black as the spores themselves, thus camouflage into it. it borders the crimson sea, and four other unknown seas. it is surrounded by several mountain ranges, making the crimson sea one of the only viable entrances. trivia[edit] - prior to the release of - , brandon suggested that midnight sea is sometimes called ""sea of night""; however, the phrase does not appear in the book, making its canonicity questionable. notes[edit]"
Jasalai,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Jasalai,brightness jasalai is the leader of the kholin warcamp at the shattered plains on roshar after dalinar kholin moves to urithiru. she is described as tall and stately. she leads dalinar and navani on a tour of the warcamp before dalinar talks to kadash. dalinar is pleased that the warcamp seems to be in good shape despite the coming of the everstorm. notes[edit]
Frillbloom,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Frillbloom,"frillbloom is a family of plants native to roshar. it is common in the chasms of the shattered plains, and grows larger there than it does in other places. frillbloom leaves are fanlike fronds that wave gently in the air. when startled, they fold in on themselves like a hand folding into a fist. they also close up when a storm is approaching. colors vary between different frillbloom species, and include yellow, orange, red, and violet. in some varieties, the fronds are veined. other varieties have spines on the tips of the leaves. kaladin makes note of lifespren dancing around frillbloom fronds in the chasms. notes[edit]"
Glyphward,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Glyphwards,"a glyphward is a vorin prayer written in glyphs with the intention of being burned. many scientifically-minded rosharans deplore glyphwards as pure superstition, with some wondering why, if the almighty is omniscient, he needs to have a prayer burned to him before he can aid someone. nonetheless, they remain a minority, and for most vorins, glyphwards are the main avenue for communicating with the almighty. for them, if the prayer fails to be answered, it's simply his will. creation[edit] the job of making glyphwards usually goes to women, though a man who knows glyphs can do so as well. regardless of who creates them, both men and women make use of them. in addition to being homemade, glyphwards can be purchased from luckmerches or apothecaries, the latter of which will often decorate their shops with them. usually, glyphwards are either drawn on long strips of paper or sewn into cloth, though at times they are drawn on surfaces with burn ink and then set on fire to burn the prayer onto something. the drawing medium is usually ink, either red or black, but if it won't stick, chalk can also be used. the ink can be of various colors, such as red or black, while the cloth or paper are typically white. the glyphward can be as short as a single glyph, or as long as several glyphs strung together. they do take some skill to draw well and neatly, so a person who can draw glyphwards calligraphically well is considered to have an impressive ability. use[edit] after a glyphward is created, it is burned to send the soul of the prayer to the almighty, although glyphwards often make an additional appeal to one of the heralds or to the stormfather to make sure they are heard. where the glyph is burned does not seem to matter - it can be in a specifically-designed brazier or censer, but it's just as valid on the ground. ardents will also burn prayers to help the people they serve, or in exchange for a monetary offering. while the glyphward is burning, it's customary for all people concerned with its contents to bow their heads. on some occasions, glyphwards are not burned right away, or at all. in some cases, one is simply sewn onto a person's sleeve in the event that they ever need it. others are worn for protection or good fortune, without ever being burned, and some rosharans will even get tattoos of glyphwards. sometimes, a person will wear a white armband on their arm, and wrap an appropriate glyphward around it whenever they feel the need to have it. when fire or flammable materials are not available, one may sketch a glyphward anyway, in hope that the almighty will understand the supplicant's situation and accept the prayer. instead of burning such a glyphward, the petitioner will then bow their head reverently for ten heartbeats. less formal prayers may also be simply traced with a finger to ward off evil. prayers[edit] though they are universally believed to turn away evil, the prayers sent through glyphwards vary quite a bit. among others, the following can be distinguished: often burned before an important action, such as a duel, or for blessings of luck or success. they typically contain glyphs specifying what the author wishes for in particular - for example, a glyphward made for a duel might be comprised of glyphs for ""safety"" and ""glory"", or just ""excellence"". other prayers simply say ""fortune"", while some implore the almighty with glyphs like ""determination"". burned to thank the almighty. can be burned after a strike of good fortune or when a difficult task is accomplished. when a vorin commits a sin of some kind, such as visiting the nightwatcher, they burn those glyphwards so that the almighty may forgive them. when someone dies, or is in danger of dying, their wife or daughters will create glyphwards to pray for their wellbeing either in this world or the next, with some people continuing to regularly burn glyphwards for their loved ones for years after they've died. in some cases, one may pray for protection of greater things, such as a nation. for personal protection, a person can wear an unburned glyphward around their arm. it's also considered prudent to have a glyphward when being near a person of suspect moral character, such as a stormwarden or a knight radiant. some prayers are specific to particular events in a person's life. - a - is a glyphward made of a glyphpair that a woman who is to be married sews onto her sleeve. after the engagement is formally announced, such a prayer is then removed and burned. - during a wedding, the bride will receive multiple glyphwards. - when a child is born, a number of glyphwards are burned, some containing the newborn's name. notes[edit]"
Ring,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ring,"the ring is an organization of cultivationspren in shadesmar, the cognitive realm of roshar. composition and purpose[edit] the ring consists of multiple members, as wyndle refers to it as ""they"". they view the old magic's touch on lift as a blessing from their ""mother"", the same term that wyndle uses for the shard cultivation. the usual purpose of the ring is not clear, but they appear to have authority among cultivationspren, as wyndle was compelled to take an assignment at their request. history[edit] the cultivationspren decided to start trying to form new nahel bonds after other spren such as the cryptics and the honorspren started to do so. as they were not sure how exactly to accomplish this due to the length of time since the recreance, the ring served as a committee that oversaw the process. wyndle's assignment[edit] wyndle was happily living in shadesmar when the ring chose him to try and form a nahel bond with someone in the physical realm. he was not happy about his mission and referred to it as an ""atrocious duty"". the ring was additionally responsible for the specific choice of lift as a bond partner for wyndle, a choice that he did not agree with. however, the ring viewed lift's youth and her experience with the old magic as positive traits in a candidate. wyndle found that bonding with lift was easier than expected and speculated that the old magic had caused her to exist partially in the cognitive realm. wyndle later accepted the fact that he had needed to be sent on an assignment. notes[edit]"
Arclomedarian,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Arclo,"arclomedarian, also known as arclo, is a dysian aimian who resides in tashikk. it is thousands of years old, having been alive since before the last desolation. appearance and personality[edit] ""“i'm building a philosophy, one meaningful enough to span ages. ”-arclo to lift in yeddaw"" its true form is made of many cremling-like creatures it refers to as hordelings that fit together to form the different parts of its body. arclo typically imitates the form of an elderly man with dark skin and a grey mustache. it is very interested in philosophical debates and often brings up some of these ideas when it speaks to lift, at one point even going off on several philosophical tangents when lift is meeting with it in the alleyway where it killed the two skybreakers acolytes. attributes and abilities[edit] over many years arclo has bred its hordelings to allow it to change its appearance to that of a human. it does its best to maintain as close to a human form as it can, but it is not confident in its ability to fool humans, and so it conceals most of its body in a tightly wrapped shiqua to compensate for this. arclo's hordelings can sense lift's spren, wyndle. history[edit] ""“your war is my war, and has been for millennia. ancient radiants named me friend and ally before everything went wrong. what wonderful days those were, before the last desolation. days of...honor. now gone, long gone. ”-arclo to lift"" arclo was known to sit on the porch of the orphanage in yeddaw and it met with lift there several times. during their conversations, it asked her about which body part she felt she was, which she brushed off as a dumb question. lift later sought arclo out when szeth told her that it was the other radiant in tashikk that nale was searching for. she found it in an alley with the corpses of two of nale's trainees. arclo revealed its true form to her and guided her towards the person she was actually looking for. relationships[edit] the sleepless[edit] ""“arclomedarian crosses us again. it meddles more and more. it has met with these new radiants. ”-yelamaiszin the first"" unlike many of the other sleepless living on roshar, arclo is not participating in guarding akinah and the dawnshard that is being hidden there. it does not follow yelamaiszin the first, the leader of most of the sleepless on roshar, who consider arclo's meeting with knights radiant to be dangerous. due to this and other ""meddling"", the other sleepless have cut arclo off from their communications. however, they don't hate it the way they do the ""true traitors."" notes[edit]"
Unativi,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Unativi,"""“instead you go chasing humans. losing your mind. going to fight? ”-unativi to ua'pam"" unativi is a peakspren sailor in shadesmar on roshar. he is the cousin of ua'pam, another peakspren bonded to zu. he runs a barge and has some skill in manifesting goods via stormlight. appearance and personality[edit] unativi is bald, like other peakspren, with more cracks on the head than the other parts of body. he likes to wear a hat. his deep cracks in his skin emanate a molten light which varies in intensity. unativi doesn't trust humans. he doesn't approve of ua'pam bonding to zu and believes that he can run from the conflict when odium's war reaches shadesmar. history[edit] in 1175, unativi brought his barge to sail the human envoy from urithiru to the honorspren stronghold of lasting integrity. he refused to take the group all the way to lasting integrity, instead sailing them to nameless and leaving them there. unativi used part of his crew's payment of stormlight to manifest goods from the ocean of beads. he got his cousin ua'pam to help him with the task and berated him for running off to fight instead of working with the crew on the barge. after reaching nameless, unativi left the barge with shallan while he and the crew looked for supplies. on his way back to the barge, he met and talked with the honorspren notum. notes[edit]"
Eila,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Eila,"eila is a city in iri in northwestern roshar during the era of solitude. it is located in southern iri at the foot of the misted mountains, near iri's borders with shinovar and babatharnam. the eila stele, an ancient carving written in dawnchant, presumably originated in or was discovered in the city. notes[edit]"
Tu Bayla,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tu_Bayla,"tu bayla is a nation on roshar. geography[edit] ru parat and fu namir are cities in the region. it borders jah keved to the east, the reshi sea to the north, a mountain range to the south, and shares land borders with yulay and marabethia to the west, as well as forming the eastern coast of the purelake. it seems to have at least one river that runs into the purelake and another that runs into the reshi sea, and may also claim some of the reshi isles close to its coast. urithiru lays in the mountain ranges to the south of tu bayla. history[edit] tu bayla was formed from parts of the silver kingdoms of sela tales and valhav. after these kingdoms collapsed tu bayla became a nation. shortly after the battle of thaylen field, the coalition of monarchs contemplates invading tu bayla to counter possible invasions into jah keved, which threatened to split the coalition's territory in two. culture[edit] its people are nomadic. tyn grew up there. the people here are organised into tribes, and as such it’s unknown if there is a true government. due to this other people look down on them. notes[edit]"
Longroot,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Longroot,"longroots are a type of plant native to roshar. description[edit] longroots are, as their name suggests, a type of long tuber that contains a sticky sap. they grow in cracks in the rock where stormwater collects. as a result, longroots are covered in dirt and crem from the highstorms when they are harvested. they are brown in color. culinary use[edit] longroots are easy to grow and are cultivated and eaten in many regions of roshar. they are not known for their taste, which is faintly reminiscent of minerals. longroots are cheap, and are often eaten only when alternatives are not readily available. since they are tubers, they have a long shelf life; they can be boxed and put into storage and can be transported by caravan. longroots are technically edible when raw but are usually cooked for a long time, commonly as an ingredient in stew. the roots are peeled and cut into chunks before stewing. lunamor experiments with longroot stew on multiple occasions, including a version with shelled finger crab meat. history[edit] longroots have been seen as a foodstuff in a number of locations across the rosharan continent, including the warcamps at the shattered plains, narak, yeddaw, rural alethkar, and the rockfall mansion in kholinar. when kaladin's family was struggling to get by due to roshone's hostility, they ate longroots and other food donated secretly by the townspeople of hearthstone. hesina and kaladin peeled longroots while they discussed spren with tien. notes[edit]"

Sleepless,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Dysian_Aimian,"""“never can tell if [a cremling] is reporting back to someone or not. ”-lift"" the sleepless, also known as dysian aimians, are a sapient non-human race from an unknown planet in the cosmere. their bodies are made up of swarms of creatures called ""hordelings"" that are mentally linked. they refer to themselves as ""sleepless"" because at least some part of the horde is always awake. some of the sleepless can be found on roshar, and they once lived in the silver kingdom of aimia. appearance and anatomy[edit] ""“the cook began to hum. pieces of her broke off. she crumbled to a pile of chittering little cremlings that moved out of her clothing, leaving it in a heap. ”-kaza, watching the cook of the first dreams"" sleepless have a unique physiology, as their ""bodies"" are actually composed of thousands of creatures called ""hordelings"" that are able to function as a single consciousness. the hordelings are not limited in how they assemble themselves; with practice, a sleepless can mimic the shape of other creatures, including humans. sleepless not on roshar would not be practiced in imitating the human form, and would look completely different. unlike siah aimians, dysian aimians cannot mate with humans. hordelings[edit] hordelings are usually about the size of a finger, but they can be as large as a fist or sometimes as large as a building. hordelings on roshar often resemble native creatures known as cremlings simply to make them less noticeable to casual observers; they can take other forms. the first swarm to come to roshar originally had spiderlike hordelings; the swarms breed their hordelings to resemble local fauna in order to blend in. the hordelings of each sleepless are not all identical, and often serve specific purposes. for example, because arclo tries to pass as a human, many of his hordelings have protrusions on their backs that resemble human parts such as skin or eyeballs; he is also able to speak with a passably human voice. however, individual hordelings cannot shapeshift, so the nature of a sleepless body is usually visible upon close inspection. sleepless therefore tend to cover their ""skin"" when possible, or use the appearance of older skin or tattoos to obscure their true nature. adaptation and regeneration[edit] ""“it took my people three hundred years of selective breeding to achieve hordelings capable of imitating human fingers. and still, most of us are terrible at pretending to be humans. we don't have the mannerisms, the thoughts. i’m younger than the others, but am more... skilled at using these things. ”-nikli"" hordelings can be specially bred to enhance specific capabilities of a sleepless, such as a heightened sense of smell or increased memory capacity, although this process takes some time. nikli notes that it took three hundred years to breed hordelings that could imitate human fingers. over the course of many generations, some have even managed to breed hordelings that are able to mimic the powers of a larkin. specialized hordelings can convincingly mimic inanimate objects. there is a limit on both the total mass and number of hordelings a sleepless can have at any given time, but the maximum number would definitely allow a sleepless to become much larger than human-sized, up to the size of a santhid corpse and possibly even larger. because they can continually create new hordelings to replace any that are lost, the personality of a sleepless can live forever, as long as not too many of the hordelings are destroyed at once. swarms on planets other than roshar would breed their hordelings as needed to imitate whatever life forms are native to that world. consciousness[edit] in practice, hordelings function as a ""hive mind"", but they are not technically one entity. hordelings have the ability to separate from the main body to act as remote agents while maintaining their mental link with the rest of the horde. certain circumstances could lead to a hordeling being split off from the group and forced to act independently. for example, a hordeling that is physically too distant from the others can lose contact with the main mind, and this would affect its cognitive aspect. a hordeling could be affected by a hemalurgic spike, but it would disconnect it from the hivemind. the sleepless are not able to split their consciousness between the cognitive realm and the physical realm. they can form multiple sapient bodies at once (for example, imitating two humans at the same time), but it is difficult and risks making the split permanent, unintentionally creating a new sleepless. this is made easier if the bodies are not engaged in intelligent tasks at the same time. reproduction[edit] sleepless are able to reproduce, but ""reproduction"" for them has a variety of connotations. they can breed specific hordelings for specialized purposes over time and can also exchange hordelings if needed in order to improve their genetic diversity. they can even crossbreed hordelings with other species such as various cremlings and the lancer. creating a new sleepless involves splitting off a subsection of an existing swarm, which subsequently gains independence over time; the sleepless term for this process is becoming ""separated"". a swarm becoming separated is not always intentional. newly independent swarms retain the genetic adaptations of their ""parent"" swarm and are able to fine-tune the evolutions of their hordelings to even greater effect. arclo refers to the other swarms on roshar as its ""siblings"". attributes and abilities[edit] all sleepless have the abilities granted by their unusual physiology, including shapeshifting, adaptive evolution, and effective immortality. it is also impossible to imprison a sleepless through conventional means. sleepless have used surgebinding in the past and may use it again in the future. arclo is able to easily kill two of nale's skybreaker apprentices and tells lift that it would not have been possible for them to kill it. sleepless would have nothing to fear even from someone as powerful as a herald, and the heralds knew to leave their kind alone. sleepless have more resistance to soulcasting compared to humans for various reasons. they are also fluent in most, if not all, human languages. hordelings have exceptional spatial awareness, allowing a horde to create maps more accurate than most instrument-measured surveys. in addition to their ability to mentally link their hordelings, each sleepless can also directly communicate with other swarms. this is achieved through buzzing that each swarm can emanate from its scattered hordelings. each swarm has a distinct buzz, and specially bred hordelings receive and interpret the vibrations. it is possible to exclude certain swarms from these communications. the sleepless are exceptionally cosmere-aware. at least some sleepless have had the power of worldhopping; arclo tells lift that it once traveled to a land she will never visit. they have some relationship to the shard cultivation and another unnamed group in the cosmere. they are aware that some unkalaki are sighted and that they guard cultivation's perpendicularity. they hold secrets about the power of the dawnshards and the shattering of adonalsium, and they have passed this information down to their ""younger"" members. they refer to lanceryn and larkin as ""ancient guardians"" and believed that protecting the akinah dawnshard mural was important to the fate of the entire cosmere. social structure and purpose[edit] ""“arclomedarian is dangerous. i can see this. but it is not as dangerous as the true traitors. ”-nikli, on arclo"" of the twenty-four known sleepless on roshar, twenty accept the authority of yelamaiszin, the first swarm, including yelamaiszin himself. they vote on important matters using the rapid communication provided by their hive minds. arclomedarian does not accept their authority, although it is not considered one of the ""true traitors"" and is still liked. it is unknown if the other three dissident sleepless are in this category, though all four of the sleepless who do not accept yelamaiszin's authority (including arclo) are still alive. the sleepless defend life, although they are willing to kill in order to preserve it. nikli states that the sleepless have chosen to do this after seeing the destruction of worlds and have vowed to never let it happen again. paradoxically, while the sleepless tend to like the knights radiant, with yelamaiszin even stating a personal admiration for dalinar, they worry that the radiants' insistence on making honorable choices is highly dangerous. despite a willingness to kill in order to protect the dawnshard from outside knowledge, the sleepless are also open to reason. rysn managed to convince them to spare the crew of the wandersail in exchange for her help in safeguarding it. they are organized into strains, which are further separated into swarms. the only named strain being the natricatich strain, of which masaka (also known as chinikdakordich) is the sixtieth swarm. lore[edit] most rosharans (other than siah aimians) do not know that the sleepless exist, with a few notable exceptions. at least some iriali have been aware of them and the unkalaki, who call them the ""gods who sleep not"", even have some understanding of their hordeling abilities. neither dalinar nor lift seem to have even heard of beings with the powers of the sleepless prior to talking to hoid and arclo, respectively. however, a few folk tales about them persisted over the years, and jasnah kholin was aware of these tales through her scholarly research. she assumed that they were myths, until she began hearing credible stories about similar creatures, possibly including lift's interaction with arclo. even then, jasnah could not fully believe such beings existed until meeting one in person. although vstim passed information about sleepless on to rysn, she did not rule out some form of lightweaving to explain her early observations of nikli's shapeshifting until seeing its powers up close. history[edit] origins[edit] sleepless, or dysian aimians, exist on multiple planets in the cosmere and are known to have traveled between them. their original planet is unknown, but they are not native to yolen. hoid is the only person known to use the term ""dysian,"" and the source of the term is unknown. all known sleepless on roshar descended from a single swarm currently named yelamaiszin. most of the cosmere's sleepless live on roshar, but unrelated swarms exist on other worlds. although not native to roshar, some sleepless lived in aimia prior to the scouring of aimia, which has been characterized by hessi as ""total destruction"". they coexisted with the siah aimians, but were not related to them. despite the fact that they survived, the destruction of their home on aimia seems to have caused the sleepless a great deal of emotional pain. heraldic epochs[edit] ""“you needn't fear me. your war is my war, and has been for millennia. ancient radiants named me friend and ally before everything went wrong. what wonderful days those were, before the last desolation. days of... honor. now gone, long gone. ”-arclo, to lift"" the sleepless had a long history with the heralds and knights radiant. some sleepless were once able to use the power of surgebinding. at least some of the sleepless, including arclo, were allies of the heralds and knights radiant during the heraldic epochs. arclo told lift that others of his kind were particularly interested in radiants. at least one sleepless may have fought during aharietiam, as dalinar kholin noticed a heap of burned, strange cremlings in one of his visions; it is not clear which side they fought on, although at least some sleepless were allied with the knights radiant. war of reckoning[edit] at the end of the era of solitude, the sleepless mostly remained hidden, monitoring events on roshar using their hordelings. they were particularly interested in dalinar, kaladin, shallan, szeth, navani, eshonai, and venli, believing them to be crucial to the future of roshar. arclo believed that lift should also be included in that group, and that the other sleepless should not ignore her. despite its general disinterest in radiants, arclo was also aware that the stump had bonded a spren and that nale was alive, referring to him as a ""madman"". ""“rysn, there are forces in the cosmere that we can barely identify, let alone track. evil forces, who would end worlds if they could. they are hunting this place. now that the ancient guardians of akinah are all but extinct, we sleepless must protect it.”-nikli"" the sleepless appeared to be guarding several secrets from humans, including something that dalinar was seeking but ""must not know"". an unnamed sleepless learned of vazrmeb's plan to sail the ship first dreams to akinah in aimia; it posed as a reshi cook and joined the crew, later poisoning everyone else on board to protect the island. it refused to divulge any of akinah's secrets to kaza even as she was dying, telling her that doing so could result in the ""ends of worlds"". true desolation and the expedition to akinah[edit] by the time of the true desolation, there were twenty-four sleepless on roshar. as both siah aimians and sleepless were immortal, the remaining individuals seemed to be aware of each other. the sleepless were forced into conflict with humans again due to radiant interest in the city of akinah. although they had managed to dissuade early patrols of windrunners from surveying the island using specialized larkin hybrid hordelings, their vehemence in protecting the island only attracted more attention to it. after queen navani commissioned rysn's ship, the wandersail, to investigate the oddities during the expedition to akinah, the sleepless were forced into steadily more aggressive confrontations with the ship's crew. these engagements resulted in the unmasking of one of their agents, nikliasorm, fatally compromising the security of their entire operation. rysn and cord managed to discover a hidden chamber underneath the island, and the dawnshard entered rysn's consciousness. at the same time, the sleepless battled lopen, huio, and the crew of the wandersail on the beach, killing three sailors. despite these events, the dawnshard maintained anonymity thanks to rysn's careful planning and negotiating. nikli revealed a number of secrets about the dawnshard, and rysn saw an opportunity to strike a bargain to keep the dawnshard hidden and train the sleepless to better pass as human. the sleepless accepted her deal, also giving her some soulcaster fabrials and a set of shardplate for cord and agreeing to avoid attacking radiants. rysn and cord were sworn to secrecy regarding the dawnshard, although they were allowed to tell people an altered version of their story. the sleepless indicated that they would monitor them with hordelings to ensure that they lived up to the bargain. after rysn struck the deal, the sleepless were at least somewhat willing to work with other humans, as one of them met with jasnah in person. hoid reported to jasnah that he did not think any of the sleepless were working with odium, but at least one of them was allied with the ghostbloods. one of the swarms replaced one of hoid's pens with a hordeling evolved to resemble a pen. hoid was baffled as to how it had evaded protections he had put in place to avoid such an infiltration. hoid hoped a friendly swarm might be responsible, but he and jasnah assumed that it was a spy that was reporting on hoid's activities to thaidakar, likely through mraize. notable sleepless[edit] - , first and oldest of the swarms on roshar - , third oldest and angriest of the swarms - , twenty-fourth and youngest swarm on roshar - , a worldhopper on - and sixtieth swarm of the natricatich strain. her sleepless name is chinikdakordich, but she has abandoned that name. - the cook of the - was an unidentified sleepless confirmed sightings[edit] brandon sanderson has indicated that conspicuous appearances of cremlings may indicate the presence of a sleepless;

Splinter,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Splintering,"""“i am a god. [...] a little piece of one. very, very little. ”-syl to kaladin"" a splinter is the term for a specific type of fragment of investiture that is ultimately derived from adonalsium. these splinters can be composed of a single shard's power or the investiture of multiple shards. they are present in many worlds of the cosmere, sometimes in abundant quantities or with self-aware personalities, while other times they are absent altogether or exist simply as a chunk of raw power guided by something else. these splinters often possess abilities themselves or are capable of granting abilities by bonding with people. splinters are generally ageless and difficult to kill or destroy. the spren of roshar and the seons of sel are some of the most well-known, although many species of splinters can be found throughout the cosmere. the shards honor, ambition, devotion, dominion, and virtuosity have been splintered, and therefore large portions of their power exist as splinters. nature[edit] at its core, a splinter is a significant measure of a shard's power that has been separated from the main body of investiture. there is a notable difference between a physical manifestation of investiture--such as atium and lerasium or a perpendicularity--and a splinter. while a shard's power is never truly separated from itself, as it is all connected through the spiritual realm, splinters represent power that has been released or removed by a shard. splinters tend to not have much in the way of a physical aspect. as a chunk of investiture they tend to be more rooted in the cognitive and spiritual realms. while many splinters are composed of the investiture of a single shard, in the case of some splinters they may actually be composed of the investiture of two or more shards. one distinguishing factor of a splinter is that it may often have an intent of its own, separate from that of its parent shard, although it may be thematically related. splinters are often sentient and have an associated personality,[fn 1] although that personality may be destroyed or its body tortured. however, they do not necessarily need a personality to be considered a splinter. generally speaking, a splinter has never been a person. therefore, by the strictest definition, a cognitive shadow may not be considered a splinter, by some. however, there is an argument to be made that a cognitive shadow is just an imprint of a once-living being on investiture, and has therefore never truly been human. generally speaking, most would consider a cognitive shadow to be a type of splinter. nevertheless, splinters and cognitive shadows operate by similar rules and many cognitive shadows may be made of an amount of investiture equivalent or potentially even greater than a typical splinter. whether or not an avatar of a shard should be considered a splinter is also a subject of some debate. while some would disagree, many people in the cosmere would be comfortable terming avatars splinters. it is certain that all splinters do not contain the exact same quantity of investiture, as a splinter may be splintered yet again into smaller fragments. however, it is likely that there exists some threshold below which a quantity of investiture is not considered to be a splinter. for instance, a divine breath is considered to be a splinter, but there is no indication that the lesser breath possessed by normal people is considered to be one. in fact, the small amount of investiture present in sapient beings, known as innate investiture, is also distinct from splinters. formation[edit] ""“i have always existed. we are not 'born' as men are, and we cannot truly die as men do. patterns are eternal, as is fire, as is the wind. as are all spren.”-pattern explaining to shallan the nature of spren."" there are a few common ways for a splinter to come into existence, and most require the will of a shard on some level. perhaps the most common is that a shard creates a splinter by intentionally separating a bit of its power from itself. this may be done for the purpose of creating some sort of synthetic race, such as the spren or seons. another reason to create a splinter is if a shard wishes to prevent a soul from passing on to the beyond. they may make it into a cognitive shadow by either merging the splinter with the soul or imprinting the soul upon the power, as is the case with the fused and the returned. they could create an avatar of their shard by using their investiture and some would call that a splinter. a shard may also splinter another shard, tearing off one or many chunks of its power, typically for the purpose of diminishing it. this is a process that transcends the three realms and if a shard is completely destroyed in this way it is said to be splintered. most commonly, a splintering may happen as one titanic event that kills the vessel and disperses its power. less frequently, a vessel may be killed and then their shard subsequently splintered. the splintering of a shard may also have serious consequences in the physical realm. the power of a splintered shard may ravage a planet uncontrollably if its investiture is not contained. there may be other physical effects of a splintering, such as the formation of an asteroid belt in the system. the process of splintering is somewhat similar to the process by which preservation stole a piece of ruin's body to hide from him. a splintered shard cannot have a vessel while it remains in such a state, but its splinters may be reconstituted into a full shard via an unknown process, although it will not restore the original vessel. this is not known to have occurred yet in the cosmere. if a splinter's parent shard is itself completely splintered, there may be some impact on any extant splinters. whether or not a shard can splinter another shard is dependent upon the amount of raw investiture that said shard is able to make use of at the time, as well as its ability to leverage said power, and its knowledge of the splintering process. there are more and less efficient ways to splinter a shard, and it may grow easier with practice. even a successful splintering is taxing on the shard performing it and may require some recovery by the shard afterward. in some cases, whether or not a shard is splintered may be somewhat vague. a shard left on its own without a vessel may also splinter of its own accord, although that is not the only possibility. vulnerabilities[edit] as splinters are fragments of energy and energy is conserved in the cosmere, they ultimately cannot be reduced to true nothingness. they may be damaged sufficiently to destroy their minds, if they are self-aware in the first place. it seems one source of vulnerability of a splinter is in any bonds it may have formed with other beings. one of the primary examples of this are the deadeyes of the knights radiant who break their oaths. these spren are effectively immortal, as their essence cannot be destroyed, but they suffer physical disfigurement in the cognitive realm and are reduced in function. when they are drawn as a blade, they experience a state of agony. the severing of the nahel bond rips out a portion of their soul, which is not easily replaceable. however, to the astonishment of many spren, deadeye cultivationspren mayalaran showed significant and ongoing rehabilitation during her time with adolin kholin. a bond between a human and a seon, another type of splinter, can also be a vulnerability for the seon. following the reod in the ten years before the restoration of elantris, seons were in danger if their master was taken by the shaod. the incorrect aon acting on the human would disrupt their bonded seon as well, causing gaps to appear in their aon, as well as a loss of any apparent sentience. these damaged seons were known to stay close to their former masters that still lived, but apart from this they were seemingly totally unaware. their minds were returned to them when raoden repaired the aon rao in elantris. other vulnerabilities of splinters appear to exist, but are less well understood. it seems apparent that if their spiritweb is directly damaged by something like a shardblade they may be killed, or if their investiture is consumed and fully corrupted by something like nightblood, as is the case with the fused. even if it is not fatal, corruption of any sort by a foreign type of investiture can cause serious changes to a splinter, as is the case with glys, a corrupted true spren. another possible vulnerability of splinters is their ability to be trapped, perhaps most particularly those splinters that lack a substantial physical aspect. splinters can be permanently killed by the use of a raysium dagger touching a gem of anti-light of the type of investiture associated with the splinter. due to their connection to their parent shard, splinters often struggle to leave the location where they were created or the system that their parent shard inhabits. however, some splinters can be even further trapped under certain conditions, such as spren inside of gemstones. it is uncertain if all splinters may be similarly trapped under the correct conditions. abilities[edit] the abilities of a splinter depend heavily on the conditions of their formation and the purpose or lack thereof that they were created with, although splinters may learn to behave in ways other than was originally intended. as previously mentioned, many splinters may become self-aware or were self-aware from the moment of their creation, but some do not and it is not a requirement to be a splinter. splinters may possess an inherent understanding of realmatic theory. one notable ability associated with splinters is the ability to get a sense of what the future may hold. this is visible across a number of different splinters, from the visions granted by the divine breath to the returned to the brief flashes of the future associated with odium's unmade. splinters, in many cases, may form bonds with other sapient beings. sometimes these bonds are capable of granting access to invested arts, such as is the case with the radiant bond in spren, but they may be a much more simple connection, as is the case with seons. ultimately, the full extent of abilities a splinter may make use of remains unknown. they are often associated with fortune and precognitive abilities. a splinter may be able to replicate preservation's imprisonment of ruin on a much smaller scale. splinters may serve as a sort of release valve on the power of a splintered shard, potentially making it less dangerous. it remains an open question whether or not a splinter may take up a full shard itself or if it would just become subsumed within that shard. kelsier's time spent holding the shard preservation may give some insight into the ability of a splinter to serve as vessel to a shard. known splinters[edit] rosharan system[edit] ""“spren are . . . power . . . shattered power. power given thought by the perceptions of men. honor, cultivation, and . . . and another. fragments broken off. ”-pattern on spren"" splinters are perhaps most populous in the rosharan system, residing in the form of spren and cognitive shadows on at least two of the planets there. on roshar, splinters most commonly take the form of spren, comprised often of some mixture between the investiture of both honor and cultivation. the shard honor has actually been splintered entirely. while these two shards are most common on roshar, self-aware splinters left by adonalsium remain on the planet. spren are more properly known as transformative cognitive entities, concepts from the cognitive realm that have gained power and sentience as people have personified them. notably powerful splinters range in power from the true spren capable of forming nahel bonds, such as the honorspren, to massive spren of larger importance such as the stormfather and the nightwatcher. certain objects created directly by the local shards, including the honorblades, may also be splinters. while the flashiest bonds may belong to surgebinders, the splinters of this world form symbiotic relationships with many species of creatures, including the ryshadium and the tai-na. splinters are also made use of in devices known as fabrials, which require trapping a splinter in order to create some sort of invested device with a specific power. the ten cognitive shadows known as heralds could be considered splinters as well, most likely created from honor's investiture. splinters of odium are also present on that world, such as the unmade, and other voidspren. the cognitive shadows of ancient long-dead singers, known as the fused, are also considered to be splinters. historically, these splinters have been confined by the oathpact to braize, a planet inhabited solely by an entire ecosystem of self-aware splinters, except during desolations. however, following the true desolation and the appearance of the everstorm on roshar, they are present on both braize and roshar. it is unknown if any splinters are present on ashyn, the third inhabited planet in the rosharan system. splinters in this system are particularly vulnerable to the unmade sja-anat, who is capable of corrupting splinters with odium's investiture. due to their strong connection to the system, it is very difficult for spren to leave the rosharan system, though it is possible through currently unknown means. nalthian system[edit] ""“i just wish i knew if there is really something spiritual about the returns, or if it’s all just cosmic happenstance.” ”-vasher on the returned"" the only known splinters present on nalthis are the divine breaths granted to the returned by the shard endowment. these splinters of endowment are intentionally granted to the recently deceased by the shard. before they move to the beyond, their souls are given a vision of the future and an opportunity to return as a cognitive shadow to influence future events. if they agree, it seems likely that a person's soul either merges with or imprints on the divine breath that returns them to life. the splinter grants them a whole host of other abilities as well, including unnaturally long life the ability to see fragments of the future when viewing art, and the ability to give away their divine breath to perform an act of healing. it is worth noting that while he may appear as such, it is unclear whether or not nightblood himself is a splinter, nightblood is not powerful enough to splinter a shard though. what nightblood does is a completely separate process to splintering. selish system[edit] ""“brief mention should be given to the entities known as the seons and the skaze, splinters of self-aware investiture who have developed humanlike mannerisms. ”-khriss's notes on sel"" in the distant past, both shards native to sel, devotion and dominion were splintered by odium. as a result the beings known as seons and skaze were formed from their splinters; although their exact origin and manner of creation is something that is currently uncertain. the seons are considered to be splinters of devotion, and more specifically it may be the aons at the heart of the seons that are the actual splinters. seons appear as glowing balls of light with an aon at their center. skaze on the other hand are formed from splinters of dominion. they are visible as dark spheres that seem to draw in light, with a ring of misty symbols around its circumference. the general nature of the seons and skaze are very much in keeping with their respective shards. seons appear to generally have the attitude of a devoted servant to their masters and view them with great affection, while the skaze have much more control within the confines of the fjordell empire and are a group of some importance to the dakhor. while there are some similarities to rosharan spren, seons and skaze are far less numerous. it is noteworthy that while there are many splinters of devotion and dominion on this world, odium left none of his power behind on sel when he moved on to a different system. one uncertainty on sel is the exact nature of the dor. while the skaze and seons represent a small portion of the splinters of dominion and devotion, the vast majority of their power is contained within shadesmar as the dor. while it is known to be composed of the combined investiture of splintered shards, it is still uncertain whether the dor itself is made up of discrete splinters or just a generalized mix of investiture. scadrian system[edit] ""“so a slow death. ati doesn’t know how to splinter another shard? or he hasn’t the strength? hmm . . . ”-khriss on ruin killing preservation"" during the time of the final empire, both ruin and preservation had no splinters of themselves on scadrial. this signifies that their god metals, lerasium and atium--despite existing as condensed investiture of their respective shards--are not splinters. in fact, there are no splinters of ruin and preservation in existence. three and a half centuries after the catacendre, harmony still does not have any splinters, but that does not preclude the possibility that one day he may have splinters of his own. any potential splinters present on scadrial would have to be brought there from another world, a notoriously tricky process. however, in the event that ruin had been successful in defeating preservation and destroying scadrial, he would have splintered preservation. somehow, rosharan spren have entered and can be found in scadrial's cognitive realm.[fn 2] utol system[edit] ""“...spirits began to float up from the stones beneath. teardrop shaped, radiant like the sun-a swirling red and blue-and the size of a person’s head. ”-hoid describing the hijo"" the shard virtuosity splintered herself at some point in the past, in the utol system. on that system's planet of komashi, the splinters are known as hijo, or 'spirits'; they form a major part of the lives of people all over komashi, and are the key to their survival on the planet. during the torio period, figures known as the yoki-hijo served to attract these, and bind them into various objects used by denizens. at one point, a group of scholars discovered that hijo could also be attracted by mechanical means to produce a more general-use form of investiture known as hion. unfortunately, the machine they awakened to automate this was commanded incorrectly, imprisoning the hijo and killing almost all the planet's human population. the survivors wrested the hion to their own needs to persevere until, seventeen centuries later, the machine was finally defeated by yumi and the hijo were freed again. they then entered into a more amicable relationship with humanity, and provided hion freely. elsewhere in the cosmere[edit] there are other places where splinters must exist that we know less about, as of yet. the shard ambition is known to have been splintered by odium, so it stands to reason that splinters of that shard exist somewhere in the cosmere. a few may exist even in the threnodite system, as we know that chunks of ambition's power were torn off there. another open ended question is whether or not the weak cognitive shadows on threnody, locally referred to as shades, can be considered splinters or not. it is debatable whether the various avatars of the shard autonomy, located on first of the sun and obrodai among other worlds, are considered to be splinters. there are some planets that only have splinters present on the world, as in the past shards have gone to planets within the cosmere and left behind a splinter before leaving. adonalsium also left behind splinters on various worlds before its death. notes[edit]"
Dru,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Dru,"dru is a slender alethi man on roshar during the era of solitude. dru worked in the district quartermaster's office. after the discovery of urithiru, dru relocated there along with most of the other alethi from the warcamps on the shattered plains. at some point he began seeing drehy, one of the men of bridge four. after the battle of thaylen field, dru boiled bandages for the wounded. as kaladin had returned from kholinar without drehy, dru believed that he had been killed and his eyes were reddened with grief. lopen saw him working and patted him on his shoulder in an attempt to comfort him. he was presumably reunited with drehy after kaladin helped recover him, gavinor and the others from the frostlands. notes[edit]"
Sorceress's island,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sorceress%27_island,"the sorceress's island is an island in the midnight sea on lumar. it is located near the border to the crimson sea. geography[edit] the sorceress's island is a small, ""suspiciously circular"" island located in the midnight sea. it is largely uninhabited bar the sorceress herself and the metal soldiers that form her army. plant life is rare on the island; it is populated by only a few lone trees, none of which have many leaves upon them. upon seeing the island, tress was surprised by how small it was, being even smaller than diggen's point. the only structure on the island is the sorceress's tower. it is surrounded by undersea rocky spikes which tear apart ships which pass across them without care. this acts as a potent line of defense against invaders and is one of the reasons the sorceress chose it. history[edit] at an unknown date the sorceress arrived from the stars with her tower and made her home on the island that would later be named after her. she chose the island on purpose due to how difficult it was for others to reach. the sorceress sent out ships to raid other nations and was effective at keeping everyone away from the island. no one ever returned from the island without at least being cursed like hoid. only the sorceress's ships were allowed to travel the midnight sea, effectively making it so no ship would ever come close to the island. tress used the threat of hoid against the sorceress, to try convince her to leave the planet. the sorceress promptly decided to leave after weighing up her chances of defeating him, and departed using her tower to leave. the sorceress's trials[edit] there are three known trials that one must pass in order to reach the sorceress herself upon her island that serve as her defenses and are the reason as to why over her time on the island, the king's armies failed to remove her. the first of these trials is crossing the midnight sea itself, full of midnight essence nominally under her control, to get to the island. these monsters, as they are called by locals, were created by the sorceress with direct orders from her to quench their thirst by hunting down anyone who enters the sea; the sorceress herself does not directly control the beasts and instead gives them a measure of autonomy. if these are passed, one must then pass the next trial: her army of metal soldiers. these soldiers are awakened constructs which also have orders to defend her, and while under more explicit control, they also possess some autonomy in their command to eliminate any threats that try to reach the island without her permission. the final trial is the tower itself; the tower is perfectly vertical and made of silver, thus making it impossible to enter without using the front door, which only someone from the inside can open. notes[edit]"
Luhel bond,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Luhel_bond,"""“ i assume you have no idea what a luhel bond is. don't feel bad. ”- hoid"" the luhel bond is a connection typically formed between a human and an aether. while it can be symbiotic or parasitic, it is defined by the person giving up physical matter, typically water, in exchange for the ability to manipulate the bonded aether. mechanics of the bond[edit] formation[edit] aethers bond with individuals that are capable of giving them water, although exactly how they choose a person differs between different aethers. the lumaran midnight aether bonds with anyone in proximity to their spores and who agrees to give them water, actively searching for beings to bond to. with other lumaran aethers, they simply choose an individual, forcibly, to be a spore eater, which differentiates a luhel bond from the nahel bond, which requires volition; the prime aethers choose their aetherbound based on unknown criteria. aethers could develop symbiotic relationships with animals similar to the ones spren on roshar develop. once the bond is formed, they are capable of granting water to the aether through an unknown process, and in the case of lumaran midnight aether, and the primal aethers, this gives a measure of control over them. it is not known if this bond has levels of progression like the nahel bond, but the bond can, at least in specific circumstances, be strengthen through imbibing more water and giving more to the aether. breaking[edit] it is possible to break at least some forms of luhel bond via a silver knife. the lumaran midnight aether is also able to break its bond to link with a new host. different forms of aether[edit] lumaran aether[edit] on lumar, the only known bondable form of spore aether is the midnight aether, also known as midnight essence. after forming a luhel bond with midnight essence, the human begins to feel an overwhelming thirst as water is extracted from their body, and in return gains control over the creature formed from the midnight essence. the amount of water drained is proportional to the amount of direct control the human has over the essence creature. uniquely, the bond between some who form a luhel bond with midnight essence is visible in the form of black lines, and the connection can be severed using a silver knife. an additional likely manifestation of the luhel bond is the spore eater condition, though whether spore eaters truly utilize the luhel bond is unknown. spore eaters are connected directly to a prime aether on one of lumar's moons, and exchange a large and eventually fatal amount of water for protection by the prime aether. this protection is granted through the related substance protecting the spore eater from any force that would break their skin. due to the seeming inability for the spore eater to manipulate these substances for any other purpose, it is likely driven by the spore eater's prime aether more directly. core aethers[edit] as the luhel bond is referred to by hoid as the manner in which aethers typically function, it is likely integral in the function of the aetherbound. indeed, known aetherbound are shown to exchange water with their bonded primal aether for the manipulation of aether. additionally, there is some form of psychic communication available between aetherbound and their bonded primal aether through this connection. notes[edit]"
Spore eater,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Spore_eater,"""“crow is host to an aggressive strain of the verdant parasite. your lore calls people like her spore eaters, though i find that an imprecise term. ”-ulaam on spore eaters"" a spore eater is a gestator for an aether that is native to the planet of lumar. while the planet doesn't seem to have an invested art allowing for the direct manipulation of aethers, such as the aetherbound can use on another world, an aether can be incorporated into a person's body in such a way to make them a spore eater and give them some protections. spore eaters provide water to the parent aethers present on the moons of lumar, and are therefore protected by that aether and very difficult to kill. mythology[edit] ""“some say it randomly happens to people who fall into the sea, while others claim you have to ingest a very special kind of spore. ”-ulaam on the lore surrounding spore eaters"" it is unclear how a person becomes a spore eater, legends hold that it requires ingesting a very special type of aether spore. this is the origin for the term ""spore eater"". other tales say that it happens to some people who fall into one of the spore seas. spore eaters are also said to have spores in their blood, although it is unclear if there is any truth to this phrase. the only known legends the people of lumar have on the curing of the affliction is by striking a bargain with the dragon xisisrefliel, who is believed to be able to cure any disease. although spore eaters don't present a particular threat to anyone beyond themselves, others are often made uncomfortable or fearful by spore eaters. mechanics[edit] when someone becomes a spore eater, the interior of the person's body becomes infested with aether. the spore eaters are directly connected to one of the larger parent aethers present on lumar's moons. the aether inside of them is insatiable for water, drawing it continually from its host and providing it to the parent aether on the moon via an unknown mechanism. these parent aethers are irrational though and draw increasing volumes of water the longer the host has been afflicted by the spore gestation. the aether on the moons draws from a number of spore eaters spread around the world in order to obtain sufficient water. a spore eater must drink water to replenish what they lose to the aether. additionally, it is also very painful to be a spore eater. the condition is progressive, and advanced spore eaters will find themselves drinking water with increasing frequency. ultimately the need for water increases until it is unsustainable, and the spore eater becomes dehydrated and withers away before dying. usually this process plays out in under a year or so, although a it can last longer. ""“the aether protects itself by protecting her, but it’s rabid. insatiable. incapable of rational thought, it is sucking her dry. the affliction is progressive, taking more and more from its host. i’m told it is exceptionally painful, and it is always fatal.”-ulaam on spore eaters"" it is unclear whether the luhel bond is involved in the creation of spore eaters. water is being drawn from the host by the aether, but they are given very limited control over the aether that infests their body. the aether within a spore eater does not respond to the mental commands of a spore eater in the way an aether would obey an aetherbound. instead they act to preserve the life of the host so they can continue draining water from them. any threat that can potentially break the skin of the spore eater is considered to be a threat by the aether. the reaction time of the aether within a spore eater is incredibly quick, the vines of a verdant gestator can stop a bullet that a spore eater fires at their own head. a very practiced spore eater can control their aether enough to prevent it from emerging when they are in danger. while spore gestation is a challenging condition, in the early stages it does offer some benefits to the host. they are nearly impossible to kill with the aethers protecting them, however they are susceptible to capture or restraint if it does not represent a threat to the life of the spore eater. a spore eater that is already a capable combatant though is a serious threat that non-invested people could struggle to defeat without some other advantage. as spore gestation is painful and ultimately fatal, there is great interest in a cure by those who are afflicted with the condition. unfortunately, there is no known permanent cure to rid a spore eaters' body of the aether within. even a very advanced offworlder like xisis claims to be unable to permanently cure the condition, merely remove it for a year or two before the spores return. a person would have to return to him every few years to be cured again, or remain by his side. it is possible though that xisis could cure a spore eater permanently, but generally prefers not to do so. lumaran histories record that queen bek was cured permanently of her spore gestation due in some part to xisis, although it is also possible that the record is inaccurate. there have been no other prominently recorded instances of a person being cured or surviving as a spore eater for long. appearance[edit] most of the time a spore eater is indistinguishable from a person without the affliction, although those in the later stages of the disease may be noticed as always drinking water or keeping a flask of water close at hand. the gestators for the verdant aether are the only sort of spore eaters that are understood in detail. when a threat is detected, the aether will emerge from the spore eater's body to protect the host. in the case of a verdant spore eater, vines will burst from the host's skin, either splitting the skin or crawling out of somewhere else, such as around the eye socket. when the vines are active, they can be seen moving beneath the host's skin. the emergence of the vines does not seem to do any significant lasting damage to their host, although the person may suffer a gash or lose a drop of blood or two from the locations where the vines appeared. known spore eaters[edit] - captain - - a gestator for the verdant aether and captain of the - queen - - a historical spore eater who was cured with the aid of xisis notes[edit]"
Burn ink,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Burn_ink,"burn ink is a flammable ink used on roshar during the era of solitude. properties and characteristics[edit] burn ink's most important characteristic is its flammability. it is designed to burn while either wet or dry, no matter the surface it is painted on. this allows for its use in glyphwards, which are prayers to the almighty that are burned. the ink itself is blood red in color. history[edit] after highprince dalinar kholin was betrayed by highprince torol sadeas at the battle of the tower, brightlady navani kholin made use of burn ink to craft a glyphward for dalinar and adolin. she used four pots of burn ink to paint a thath glyph on the ground, which she burned in a prayer for justice. notes[edit]"

Shiqua,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Shiqua,"a shiqua is a garment worn by the tashikki on roshar. design[edit] a shiqua is a long single sheet, wrapped around the entirety of the wearer's body from head to toe, winding around arms and legs individually, sometimes also being wrapped back around the waist as a skirt. the garment is worn by both men and women. the fabric used in a shiqua is usually a solid color such as yellow, black, or brown. to create the garment, the fabric must be draped and tied around the body in a distinctive way. cloth wrapped around the body haphazardly will identify the wearer as a foreigner. arclo has learned to correctly wrap a shiqua, as it helps him conceal his true form. adolin noticed at least one spren in celebrant wearing a shiqua with trousers, an unusual combination. cultural significance[edit] the shiqua has a religious purpose: to cover up the wearer's body from an entity named nun raylisi (rayse), the enemy of the god tashi. tashikki people almost always wear the wraps, even in far-off lands such as kharbranth. within tashikk, it is considered less necessary to fully cover the body, because it is believed that tashi protects the residents there. people therefore sometimes adjust the shiqua to expose their head and face within their homeland; they may also pull up the shiqua to allow more movement in their legs. some tashikki do wear other types of clothing; the tashikki ambassador to urithiru notably wore a flowery suit to the first meeting of the monarchs. notes[edit]"

Zyardil,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Zyardil,"zyardil is a sleepless living on roshar. attributes and abilities[edit] like other sleepless, zyardil is made up of a swarm of small creatures known as hordelings that share a hive mind, making its consciousness effectively immortal. the hordelings can be selectively bred to provide the swarm with enhanced abilities. zyardil seems to be one of the older swarms on roshar, and is likely thousands of years old. it communicates with other swarms using a sharp, punctuated buzz. it is extremely knowledgeable about both the past and present of roshar. history[edit] zyardil was one of the swarms that remained loyal to yelamaiszin, the first swarm. it was therefore involved in protecting akinah after the scouring of aimia, and participated in votes held among the twenty loyal swarms regarding important decisions. during the wandersail's expedition to akinah, zyardil was involved in a discussion with some of the other swarms about how to stop the humans. it expressed disappointment that the discovery of the first dreams had renewed interest in aimia. unlike yelamaiszin, it did not believe that dalinar would destroy the sleepless because he had made the decision of honor. zyardil believed that killing the crew of the wandersail was a bad idea since they were on an exploratory mission; it believed their deaths would result in more expeditions to the islands. it encouraged yelamaiszin to listen to younger swarms like nikliasorm regarding the best way to deal with the humans. notes[edit]"
Silver,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Silver,"the metal silver has some notable properties in the cosmere. the effects of silver are still not fully understood, but it somehow is able to disrupt various forms of investiture. whereas aluminum is able to block investiture, silver's effects can be more destructive. aluminum can be used to reduce or negate silver's effects. uses[edit] threnody[edit] silver is a significant substance and a valuable currency in the forests of hell, as it is known to repel shades. shades that touch it are thrown backward, though the touch of the spirits blacken and ruin the metal. a ring of silver is installed around every house to ward off the shades, and the ring needs to be maintained regularly. silver is particularly dangerous to shades for unknown reasons. silver can also heal the effects of a shade attack. silver dust is applied immediately to areas of the body that are affected, reversing the necrotic effects of the shade's touch. applying silver too late would have no effect on the wound. threnodite chains[edit] silvery chains that originate on threnody somehow allow a user to ""anchor"" themselves through a cognitive anomaly. the implications of anchoring are unknown, but the chains are incredibly rare and valuable on other planets. they are used by the scholars of silverlight. the chains are described as ""silver"" or ""silvery"", but their exact composition is unclear. raboniel was immediately shocked at the sight of a threnodite chain on roshar while kaladin failed to notice anything unusual about a chain that he saw in shadesmar, implying that the chains have distinguishing characteristics that are not obvious to every observer. lumar[edit] on lumar, silver renders aether spores and materials inert. upon coming close to silver, spores turn a dull grey and die, losing their reactivity with water. a silver knife can also sever a luhel bond. due to the aether-resistant properties of silver, ships on lumar are partially coated in it on the deck and railings, with lines of silver often running between wooden planks. they are also used in spore cannonballs in order to more accurately control when they release their spores and water. ships also have silver-edged axes on board, which crewmates can use to break away verdant vines holding the ship in place. silver's effect on spores is not instantaneous. spores may take a few seconds to be fully neutralized by silver, especially in large quantities. roseite is known to resist the effects of silver, particularly if it has been hardened. unlike spores, midnight essence must touch silver to be affected by it, rather than simply being in its proximity. much like how shades blacken and damage silver upon interacting with it, aether spores slowly tarnish and break down silver. silver has a finite capacity for neutralization; if a silver-reinforced ship were to sink in a spore ocean, the silver would kill many spores but eventually become inert. due to this effect, the silver used in ship construction likely requires periodic replacement.[citation needed] sorceress[edit] the sorceress's tower is fully coated in a layer of silver, offering protection from spores and enemy sprouters. however, the tower did not originate on lumar, and it is unknown if the silver exterior also serves other purposes. other planets[edit] on planets where silver is not known to exhibit special properties (such as scadrial, roshar, and sel), it is typically used as jewelry or decoration. scadrial[edit] silver is allomantically inert and is not known to play a role in feruchemy or hemalurgy. if a mistborn attempts to burn silver, nothing happens. although silver alone does not have allomantic properties, electrum is an alloy of forty-five percent gold and fifty-five percent silver. like all metals other than aluminum (and certain aluminum alloys), silver can be used as an anchor by coinshots and lurchers. silver has interesting properties that are undiscovered on scadrial. it is unclear if these properties would directly affect the metallic arts. roshar[edit] on roshar, silver could potentially be used to permanently kill spren, unlike aluminum. a silver-nickel alloy houses the polestone on the pommel of at least one raysium dagger used by the fused, but the metal does not affect the dagger's function. trivia[edit] - brandon originally envisioned the allomantic partner of - as silver instead of - , changing his mind after learning that he was under the false impression that pewter had a high quantity of silver. - even years later, he sometimes forgets that silver was replaced with tin. - because silver is such a well-known metal in real life, brandon still wanted to include it in the allomantic table. he considered swapping it in for aluminum as the metal that wipes out other metal reserves in chapter 36 of - , when - is captured in - . however, he decided that silver was too abundant to have this effect. - he has some regrets about leaving silver out of allomancy, but the fact that aluminum goes from very rare to very common after a society becomes industrialized lends itself well to the long-term arc of - . - after replacing silver with tin, brandon was concerned that the description of - earring might be confusing, so it became 'silver coated'. - sheath is described as ""silver"" in - , but it is actually made of - . - has metallic silver spikes, horns, and claws, but they are composed of - . notes[edit]"
Aether,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Aetherbound,"""“it's called an aether. an ancient entity predating the creation of your world. twinsoul can grow it, manipulate it. would you like to know more? ”-moonlight to marasi"" aethers are an ancient variety of invested entities present in the cosmere. they originate on an unrevealed planet where the twelve primal aethers reside, although the aethers have since spread to other worlds of the cosmere. those who are bonded to one of the twelve primal aethers and are able to manifest that aether are known as aetherbound. aethers have existed since prior to the shattering of adonalsium, and some believe that they predate adonalsium itself or are totally independent from its creations. all forms of aether seem to be killed by silver and salt, turning grey and losing their reactivity when they touch it. the substance they produce upon expanding also grows grey and dies when coming into contact with silver. on lumar the associated substance can continue growing if more moisture is added, until it maxes out. it is unknown if that property applies to aetherbound manifested substances. while growing in such a manner, a sprouter is able to shape it by using iron to pull the material closer, and steel to push it away. culture and mythology[edit] ""“silajana demands that i warn you, you have been given this rebirth to bless, encourage, and uplift those around you. by your actions here, you prove this gift wasted. if you are destroyed today by resisting my defense of these innocents, you reject your great blessing-and may not be given rebirth again for many, many centuries. lay down your weapons and let us pass, or suffer my wrath. ”-prasanva to the members of the set"" the people of the planet with primal aethers hold it as a sacred tenet that the aethers predate adonalsium and are independent of its creations. the aethers themselves believe collectively they are the equals of adonalsium. aethers are revered by these people. they believe that aethers made all people, creating them to each think differently from one another. they also believe humans were gifted with rebirth by the aethers to encourage, bless, and uplift their fellow people. those that follow the aethers also hold that people return to the aethers upon their deaths to reflect upon their choices in life. it is believed that people who have made poor choices are cursed to wait a long time until their next rebirth. they often swear with phrases such as ""by the first aether"". on lumar, it is a practice to use cannonballs filled with water, in order to cause further damage to enemy ships through the violent expansion of the associated substance. primal aethers[edit] ""“both less and more than a god. silajana is one of the primal aethers. they predate adonalsium, you know, and exist outside of his power.”-prasanva to marasi"" the primal aethers are a group of twelve sapient aethers that exist on an unknown world in the cosmere. they are revered on that planet and grant mortal servants a bud of their core, making them into aetherbound. little is known of these primal aethers aside from silajana, the roseite primal aether. suna and vishwadhar may be two other primal aethers, they are referenced along with silajana by twinsoul. they are known to be very ancient and very powerful, not comparable to shards, but still beyond the strength of most non-shard entities in the cosmere. though they personally believe themselves to be equals in strength to adonalsium itself. silajana[edit] silajana is the roseite primal aether, bonded to prasanva among others. little is known of silajana, although he was supportive of the ghostbloods and their work done on scadrial countering trell. he has sent prasanva into exile, away from his homeworld, and would not allow him to return and risk another extermination. prasanva's mission on to scadrial was to gather allies and resources. aetherbound[edit] ""“this bud connects me to silajana and through him to all of his other aetherbound. he is the core, and we his web. he is eternal, and we his mortal agents in the cosmere. ”-prasanva on the aetherbound"" aetherbound are the invested servants of the primal aethers. they are connected to one of the twelve aethers and granted a bud of that aether’s core. the bud at least sometimes appears as a physical change to the body of the person that corresponds with the aether they have bonded. unlike other bonds like between spren and radiant, each aetherbound is not connected to their own individual aether. instead they are all bound to the same primal aether; for instance all roseite aetherbound have a bud from silajana. an aetherbound can grow and manipulate that same type of aether from their bodies. they are capable of controlling the size, shape, and behavior of the aethers they produce, within certain constraints. this process requires water drawn from the aetherbound's body to facilitate the growth of the aether. the larger the mass, the more water will be required. this seems to be connected to the manner in which aether spores violently expand upon interaction with water. the effects of dehydration caused by aethers can be quickly reversed if the aetherbound drinks more water. the manipulation of aethers by the aetherbound is mostly constrained by the size of the aether and their ability to visualize clearly what they want to produce. it takes skill and talent to produce complex mechanisms, such as producing a functional gun out of roseite. when an aether is manifested in the physical realm, it can only persist if it is present in certain fields of investiture. if these fields are not present, the aether will be dependent on physical contact with the aetherbound’s body to sustain itself. without that contact, the aether will degrade and eventually vanish. more localized external sources of investiture can also be set up for the aether to feed upon instead, which will allow the aether to persist without physical contact with an aetherbound. rather than relying on water for fuel, pure investiture can be substituted for water, allowing an aetherbound to perform more dramatic feats than would be normally possible. they are also always in contact with the primal aether that granted them their bud. the primal aethers are able to speak into the minds of their aetherbound, offering wisdom, encouragement, and knowledge. additionally, the primal aether may be able to perceive areas where their aether is present. for instance a roseite aetherbound might grow their aether over a wall and the primal aether could describe to them what is present on the other side. little is known about the abilities of non-roseite aetherbound. there are twelve types of primal aether, and presumably twelve corresponding varieties of aetherbound. one must be an aetherbound to produce new aether, so physical pieces of aether are not particularly useful to anyone else. even cosmere scholars such as those in silverlight do not yet understand how to control them. varieties of aether[edit] roseite[edit] the roseite aether manifests as pink-red crystals, similar to rose quartz. generally the crystals have smooth surfaces that are occasionally marred by small pits. aetherbound that are bonded to silajana, the source of the roseite aether possess a bud that replaces a portion of the skin and muscle on the palm of their hand with roseite, leaving the bones of their hand visible underneath the roseite. when roseite aether is no longer being maintained by an aetherbound, it collapses into a fine rose-colored dust or powder, which eventually sublimates to a rose-colored mist. aetherbound that are able to control roseite have fine control over a number of its attributes, including its general coloration and clarity. they have not been shown to be able to make roseite of any color, but they can control the shade of the roseite, choosing whether it appears more red or pink and whether it is transparent or opaque. roseite is a useful material for a number of purposes. roseite is a strong material, resistant to gunfire, although bullets will chip the roseite when they impact it. it is useful to create items or tools that rely on the strength or structure provided by the crystal. simple tools like creating a fountain pen nib on the aetherbound's index finger, a small knife, a pointer, or a water glass can easier be created, as well as weapons like a mace and other small structures such as chairs and ladders. as with all aethers, its maximum potential utility is directly related to the creativity, skill, and understanding of the person manifesting the roseite. a knowledgeable person can turn a map into a model of a city made of roseite, or create a functional roseite gun if they can visualize the mechanisms. elderly aetherbound or those who have difficulty standing can use the aether to help with their stability, growing lines of aether along the edges of their joints and limbs for support. roseite can also be grown to form a useful pair of spectacles, including with larger external magnifying lenses. advanced uses of roseite include a juggernaut, a large exoskeleton of roseite that protects the aetherbound within the body and is incredibly difficult to bring down, even with gunfire. the body of the juggernaut is still comprised of firm crystal, but it is created with joints that allow it to move. roseite can also form larger machines, such as an elevator if need be. these latter two examples may require so much aether that they need purified investiture or some other source of power in order to be created or controlled for long. zephyr[edit] the zephyr aether can be used as emergency propellent during space travel. spores[edit] aether spores are found on the planet lumar, where they rain down in lunagrees from the twelve moons, forming seas on the planet. dark aether[edit] ""“[my] homeland is inhospitable to my kind for now. i joined lord kelsier for the opportunity to gain allies and resources for my eventual fight against the dark aether. ”-prasanva on the dark aether"" the dark aether is some sort of threat present on the homeworld of the primal aethers. it may have made the planet inhospitable for roseite aetherbound or any aetherbound. it may be related to the forces present in the aetherbound prasanva's homeland and some sort of extermination. prasanva has gone offworld in search of other allies to bring back to help fight this dark aether. lumar aethers[edit] aethers on lumar are an especially parasitic strain focused on self-propagation through compressed aether spores. compared to normal aethers, these bond with their hosts far more aggressively. they are especially unstable, with the smallest hint of water (or blood) leading to uncontrolled expansion as it pulls investiture from the spiritual realm, this expansion is very rapid, comparable to lightning. despite expanding even more when put into contact with more water, they do have a maximum extent to which they are able to grow. when they reach this maximum growth potential, they stop reacting with water and (in the case of verdant aether) can be safely eaten. the direction of this expansion can be changed by various factors, such as the cognitive phenomena surrounding it, shaped by thoughts and commands. it is also pushed away by steel and attracted by iron. there are ""overgrown"" aethers known as prime aethers that live on lumar's twelve moons. the prime aethers propagate themselves by creating their spores and sending them down to lumar. although the moons do not have water, the prime aethers still need it to survive, so they choose people on lumar as ""spore eaters"". these people host a manifestation of the aether within their bodies; the prime aethers progressively drain water from them, eventually leading to death. spore eaters are protected by the aether that they are made to gestate, which actively tries to prevent the death of its host. the method through which the water is transferred to the respective prime aether is not known. the prime midnight aether on lumar may be named thanasmia, but this name has not been confirmed. history[edit] aethers have been present in the cosmere since at least prior to the shattering of adonalsium, and may predate adonalsium altogether. while they were initially native to a single world, different variants of the aethers have since spread to other planets, and now claim to have no specific planet of origin. at some point a conflict with the dark aether began on the planet of the primal aethers, which was too difficult to be defeated by prasanva and may have led to his exile. at some point mraize may have visited a world containing aethers, as he has a piece of roseite in his collection. as mraize is a worldhopper, the provenance of the roseite aether in his collection is unknown, but he is not able to make use of that piece of aether. later his laundress mem was tasked with removing an aether stain on mraize's azish cavalrylord's suit. she thought it might be a combination of oil and blood and had a great deal of difficulty removing the stain, but eventually cleaned it off without damaging the suit's delicate mycalin dye. mraize was surprised by her success and gave her a bonus. foil is trying to achieve control over the aethers. khriss thinks that the discovery of anti-investiture may disprove some of his theories about them. the aethers are also relevant to the cosmere space age. known aetherbound[edit] - (bound to - ) - agent of the ghostbloods that fled to scadrial after some sort of extermination on his home world. trivia[edit] - aethers originated in the unpublished novel - .

Bek,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Bek,"queen bek the fifteenth is a queen on lumar and a known spore eater. she is reportedly the only person in recorded history on lumar to be cured from her condition, and xisis was allegedly involved. as xisis claims he can only temporarily subdue the gestation, and not completely remove it, bek may not have been entirely cured as histories claim. however, this could have been a lie to prevent crow from trying to escape. notes[edit]"
Sorceress's tower,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sorceress%27s_tower,"the sorceress's tower is a spaceship in the possession of riina. it is the ship she used and lived in whilst on lumar, landing on the sorceress's island in the midnight sea. it is controlled by an entity named seslo, who follows the orders of riina. the spaceship itself is built like a conventional rocket with a single booster at the bottom, when landed on her island this booster is not visible thus causing locals to mistake the structure for the 'tower.' the outside walls are made out of a single layer of silver, this makes the structure impossible to scale or stick to. due to the silver any aethers that touch the outside the tower also dies, this protects the tower from any enemy sprouters and any rogue midnight essence. there are only two entrances and exits into the building, the first the main entrance that she walks through and one for her 'ravens' that she uses as familiars. both doors are locked by modern means but as local lumarans do not understand the technology they presume it to be another case of the sorceress's magic. internally the tower resembles that of an office building with clear hallways with a single red carpet leading through them. along this hall there are various aonic symbols carved into the structure, it is unclear if these served any purpose or are purely decorative. although resembling that of a hospital room the lumarans generally consider the structure beautiful as they have no equivalent elsewhere. the inside consists solely of this hall and a stair case up to the top of the tower, where there is a bridge for the sorceress to be based in. there is presumably another room elsewhere in the vehicle that can store her metal army. from her tower, riina watches over much of lumar through hidden surveillance cameras. this includes a camera on fort's board, as its security hadn't been turned on. when hoid and tress force riina to leave lumar, she does so in her tower, removing it from the planet. notes[edit]"
Alalhawithador,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Alalhawithador,"""“this is a mess. it should not have gone this far. ”-alalhawithador"" alalhawithador is a sleepless swarm living on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] alalhawithador's appearance is unknown, but it can presumably take on various forms due to its sleepless physiology. it communicates with the other sleepless in a low, angry buzz. it is aggressive, and eager to rush to the most violent solution; nikli considers it to be the most volatile of all rosharan swarms. nonetheless, alalhawithador appreciates nikli's fondness for humans, although this is mostly because it believes this will let nikli blend in among them much better. when faced with failure, alalhawithador is acerbic and accusatory. abilities and attributes[edit] ""“more of us should spend time studying humans, to become like them. ”-alalhawithador"" alalhawithador is a sleepless, a hive mind of small creatures known as ""hordelings"" that it can breed to fulfill specific purposes. as its cognitive functions are spread across multiple hordelings, this makes it effectively immortal. new sleepless swarms start life with the genetic enhancements added by their predecessors; alalhawithador is therefore relatively unskilled at imitating humans compared to a younger swarm like nikli. however, it's confident in its combat skills, and believes itself capable of killing a whole crew of humans, including two knights radiant. history[edit] alalhawithador was the third sleepless to separate from yelamaiszin, the first swarm to settle on roshar. alalhawithador is almost as old as yelmaiszin; it is likely more than four thousand years old, and possibly much older. over the millennia, it was one of the swarms that remained loyal to yelamaiszin and helped protect akinah and its hidden dawnshard after the scouring of aimia. older swarms like alalhawithador are exceptionally knowledgeable, but bear the burden of many difficult memories. when the wandersail sailed for akinah, alalhawithador went along with nikli's initial plan to simply warn the humans off with manufactured omens. however, after nikli's first and second attempts failed, it lost patience and began to push for killing all humans on board. when the swarms got sidetracked into discussing humans at large, alalhawithador pulled them back on track, and pointed out that first dreams, the ship whose recovery prompted the expedition, was likely deliberately placed so that someone would find it (presumably by arclomedarian). alalhawithador's plans for the crew of the wandersail involved letting them attempt to breach the storm surrounding akinah; if they managed to survive and land on the beach, it believed the sleepless could easily kill them all. other sleepless agreed with this plan, but nikli was eventually given one more try to dissuade the crew. as a loyal follower of yelamaiszin, alalhawithador presumably honored the treaty that was reached with rysn and cord after the discovery of akinah's secrets. notes[edit]"
Vazrmeb,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Vazrmeb,"vazrmeb is the captain of the ship first dreams on roshar. appearance and personality[edit] vazrmeb is thaylen and has the long white eyebrows characteristic of his people. he has long, curly hair. he is unusually tall for a thaylen, as tall as a typical alethi, and has large arms and hands. kaza remarks that he does not conform to the stereotypical image of thaylens as parsimonious merchants. he is boisterous and appears to be a skilled captain, as he is able to keep his crew organized through a deadly storm. history[edit] vazrmeb was infatuated with the legends of hidden riches on akinah in aimia. although most rosharans considered akinah unreachable, he and his helmsman droz sought to travel to the island. few sailors were willing to attempt this journey, so vazrmeb hired a mercenary crew in steen. it is not clear whether he owned the ship first dreams or if it was chartered. he had at least some prior knowledge of the stone spikes blocking entry to akinah, and hired kaza in liafor (at great expense) to soulcast them into smoke. first dreams sailed north from liafor and encountered a massive storm on the aimian sea that abruptly ended near akinah. kaza was able to soulcast the spikes, allowing the crew to approach the island in dinghies. however, vazrmeb had been poisoned and killed along with the rest of the crew by the ship's cook, a sleepless posing as a human. kaza was the only person besides the cook to reach the shore alive, and before she ended her life she noticed that the island did in fact appear to contain the gemhearts that vazrmeb was seeking. however, these gemhearts would later prove to be fake. navani kholin later learned of vazrmeb's ambition from the prince of liafor while investigating the mysterious reappearance of the first dreams as a ghost ship, although she did not know his fate. notes[edit]"
Tashikk,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Tashi,"tashikk is a princedom on roshar that is a major ally to azir. the people of tashikk are called the tashikki. geography[edit] tashikk is located in southwestern roshar, in the southernmost part of the geographical region of makabak. it lies on the northern shore of the eastern aimian sea and borders liafor to the west, yezier and azir to the north, and emul to south-east, the latter on a river. tashikk appears to be rather flat, with wide, grass-covered fields. local fauna and flora includes axehinds, a species of deer-like, herbivorous crustaceans that live in herds; drop-deads, tall, spindly trees so called for their ability to lie flat on the ground when a highstorm comes; and a species of moss that grows between ground and loose rocks, sticking the two together to protect itself. cremlings are noted as particularly unusual in tashikk compared to the ones found further north and east. tashikk has only one known major city, yeddaw, likely its capital. south of yeddaw is also the town of ifaba. history[edit] during the heraldic epochs, tashikk was part of the silver kingdom of makabakam. it's uncertain when they split off from it. at some point, they joined the azish empire as a member state. shortly before the true desolation began, the herald nale was travelling across tashikk with szeth and several other skybreakers, tracking down and killing new surgebinders in a misguided attempt to prevent a new desolation. this ended with the arrival of the everstorm, when nale departed, leaving szeth behind. he would later come back and take him to the purelake. dalinar used the tashikki relay stations to warn the world about the everstorm. he later contacted the prince of tashikk to get him to join his coalition, but the prince refused to commit, waiting for the decision of azir. when the azish decided to ally with urithiru, tashikk did as well, and they sent the tashikki ambassador in azimir to the tower-city as their representative. taravangian later used tashikk to spread the information about the eila stele and break up the alliance. while azir did leave the coalition in the aftermath, whether tashikk did as well is unknown, as several other member states, such as yezier and emul, remained. politics[edit] ties to azir[edit] though ruled by an unnamed prince, tashikk is part of the azish empire, a union of states led by the king of azir, the prime aqasix. historically, it's considered to be the state closest to the azish throne, alongside yezier. among others, this gives tashikk access to the imperial shardblades, which they can rent out from azir for their own purposes. the tashikki maintain an ambassador in azimir for diplomatic purposes, with the current one being the prince's brother. military[edit] the tashikki fleet possesses numerous ships, including troop carriers and scouts. in times of peace, their duty is to patrol the grand waterway, though which body of water this refers to is unclear. additionally, the fleet is closely tied to azir. the ships are partially staffed by battalions of azish troops, and in times of war, the prime can use them for their own purposes. the azish military presence in tashikk is not limited to its ships. the credentials of achievement, issued to soldiers by azish viziers, are valid in the country, and many azish soldiers find employment there both as guards and in combat duty. information trading[edit] even beyond the azish empire, tashikk is roshar's greatest spanreed hub, and the reeds connected to it are used even as far east as alethkar. more than simply a relay station, tashikk provides spanreed services to the entire world, distributing them and providing connections. they are also well-known for their ability to acquire information from all over, and sharing it for outrageous prices. rumours and gossip traveling the world often start in tashikk. culture[edit] people[edit] the people of tashikk are ethnically makabaki, with dark brown skin. they are known to be polite and reserved, even compared to their northern neighbors. much like the azish, the tashikki are highly formal, and their society is highly bureaucratized. alongside spheres, information is considered a valid currency among them. both men and women typically wear shiquas, complex, one-sheet wraps covering their entire body, including the face. the exceptions to that include guards, who need clothing that's easier to move in, and diplomats, who will sometimes use more common, international styles when abroad, presumably to fit in. religion[edit] the tashikki shiqua is religiously-motivated -- it is worn to protect the wearer from the eyes of nun raylisi, an evil entity that represents odium in their religion. opposing nun raylisi is the god tashi (the local name for ishar), also known as god of gods and binder of the world. he is assisted by the nine, a group of entities who ""bound the world"" together with him (presumably the other heralds). it is believed that tashi protects the tashikki in their home nation, and so they usually forego the face covering there, but keep it on when abroad. in yeddaw, the last of the ten types of pancakes made during the weeping is dedicated to him, though unlike the others, it is metaphorical, thought about rather than physically made. the name tashikk likely derives from tashi. notable citizens[edit] - - a - from the - - an azish guard working in - prince of tashikk - ruler of the country - prince's brother - ambassador to - and, later, - an unnamed - squire notes[edit]"
Lumar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Seethe,"""“i don't think i gave proper attention to just how beautiful tress’s world was. to me, it was a backwater planet drowning in the dross of the aethers, which are more useful in other incarnations-and far easier to harvest on the moons themselves anyway. and yet, nowhere else in my travels have i witnessed anything like those spores. ”-hoid"" lumar is a planet in the cosmere whose twelve moons are home to a unique strain of aethers. only outsiders call it such, though the word ""lumar"" is roughly similar in meaning to names given to the planet by some local cultures. geography and ecology[edit] moons and spore oceans[edit] lumar is located in an unknown star system considered a backwater of the cosmere. the planet is surrounded by a set of twelve moons, each hanging in equidistant, geostationary orbits oppressively close to the surface. each day, the sun passes behind one of the twelve moons, leading to the shadow cast from it cooling the land by a few degrees. this is is called a moonshadow, and is different from a total eclipse. each moon is home to one of the twelve aethers; those aethers produce spores, which rain down on lumar's surface in great, perpetual falls known as lunagrees. as a result, the entire planet is covered by oceans of aether spores. the seas and moons figure heavily in the local language, with many people swearing by the moons or using phrases like ""how on the seas"". owing to the moons being of equal distance to one another, each sea is of the same size, and roughly the same pentagonal shape. this functions geometrically as twelve pentagons that tesselate the sphere, and due to the shape of the seas and the planet, each sea would border five others, with three around each vertex. the surface is uneven -- each sea is effectively a pile of sand, highest at the lunagree and lower on the border, where spores of the neighboring seas intermingle. however, the sheer size of the seas makes the incline imperceptible unless one is extremely close to the peak. far below the surface, the seafloor is full of thermal vents that pump out great amounts of air bubbles, along with the decomposition process of the spores. this leads to the spores fluidizing, which makes the oceans behave akin to liquid. the locals call this process the seethe. the seethe usually lasts days; however, it will commonly pause for varying periods of time, known as stillings leaving all ships sailing across it sporelocked until it picks up again. during those periods of calm, the ocean is solid enough to walk on, though one must exercise great care when doing so. ships on the seas tend to have reinforced bows in order to protect the ship from the thick spores. the seas are not especially deep, measuring only a few hundred yards at their deepest. there is an entire complex ecosystem of its own at the bottom; however, nothing is known about it. it is a matter of research by xisisrefliel and his servants. the maps of lumar keep the pentagonal shape of the seas, but it is not known what sort of projection these use in order to retain the shape despite regular pentagons being unable to tile the plane. known oceans[edit] - (made of verdant aether; also known as verdant sea) - (made of crimson aether) - (made of midnight aether) - (made of zephyr aether; also known as zephyr sea) - (made of - aether) of those five, only emerald, sapphire and rose seas are commonly known to be inhabited. people can be found on the other oceans, however -- xisis and his servants live at the bottom of the crimson sea, while the midnight sea is home to the sorceress and her midnight essence creatures. it can be further assumed that a sunlight sea exists, due to the existence of sunlight aether. while no such sea is explicitly named, there is an unnamed ocean on the planet that has gold-colored spores. aethers and spore eaters[edit] ""“your moons are home to a group of voracious entities known as aethers. though the true aethers on other worlds have a symbiosis with people, the ones on your moons have become insatiable, aggressive, and fecund. ”-ulaam"" the lumaran strain of aether is aggressively hungry for water; the slightest contact with it, or any liquid containing it (such as sweat or blood) will cause the aether spores to burst into their element. this presents immense danger to all living creatures on the planet, as inhaling even a single spore can cause an explosion of growing vines, massive spikes or simply bursts of air in a person's body -- an event that is almost always deadly. silver and salt both kill the spores, however, which the people of lumar exploit to stay safe. the main aethers on the moons themselves seem to exhibit some level of sentience, although they are irrational and rabid. occasionally, a human down on the planet's surface will become infected by the more sentient aether -- such people are known as spore eaters. it is unclear how one becomes infected with aether; theories range from people falling into the seas and somehow surviving, to consuming a special spore. whatever the cause, as a result, the aether forms a parasitic relationship with the spore eater, demanding that the host feed it increasing amounts of water. the water provided by the spore eaters is somehow used to feed the main aethers on the moons. in exchange, the aether protects the spore eater from harm. as such, spore eaters are incredibly difficult to kill -- so long as they can keep their aether fed. over time, the aether demands more and more water, and lacking it, begins to consume its host. as such, the affliction is both incredibly painful and always fatal, with most spore eaters lasting no more than a few years before their parasite consumes them. it is generally incurable; only the dragon xisis can heal the infection, and he claims that the cure must be continuously reapplied, or else the parasite will return within a year or two. while twelve varieties of aether can be found on lumar, there is also a local legend of a thirteenth type of spore called ""bone spores"", whose color is debated to be white, black, or both. it is unknown where the story might have come from. this description is similar to sand on taldain, whose organisms react to investiture by turning from black to white. rainfall[edit] ""“yes, the spores are dangerous-they create red spines, sharp as a needle. but the real danger is the rain. ”-crow"" though lumar does have a water cycle, it is poorly understood. clouds take the form of narrow ribbons that weave swiftly along the sky, creating curtains of rain known as rainlines. as the water energizes the spores, squalls cause massive manifestations of the aethers' elements, making them a further danger to living beings. however, over most oceans, squalls are predictable; a ribbon of rain will always follow the same pathway, enough so that the lumarans create rain maps that can accurately predict their locations for centuries. the only exceptions to this is the crimson sea, infamous for its unpredictable squall patterns. rainfall there comes unexpectedly and follows random paths, which can be particularly dangerous to sporelocked ships. as such, this ocean remains uninhabited, with few vessels surviving the journey there. the water cycle on lumar is very strange and not fully understood, having some relation to the decomposition of spores on the seafloor. it is a point of curiosity and research by xisis. land and fauna[edit] although most of the planet is covered in spore oceans, lumar does have numerous islands inhabited by humans. some islands have enough soil to grow ordinary crops; others are barren rocks. little is known about planetary flora, save that flowers and trees of unspecified species can both be found. the largest known land feature of lumar are multiple mountain ranges that border the crimson sea. they are largely considered impassable for ships; as such, the only way to cross to the other side of the planet, at least in that direction, is through crimson and the bordering midnight sea. humans are the only known sapient inhabitants of lumar, barring rare offworlders such as ulaam or xisis. there is no coral, or any other sea life on the planet, owing to the oceans being deadly to any water-based living creature. fish, however, can be found in lakes on some of the islands. rats, cats, pigeons and butterflies are common, as are seagulls; despite the dangers of the spore oceans, the birds can often be found far from the island shores. known islands[edit] history[edit] it is unknown how lumar came to be inhabited by people, or whether the planet was always home to aether spores. it is known that for a time, it was home to the iriali people; however, one day the iriali simply disappeared, seemingly without a trace and leaving all their possessions behind. at around the same time, the people of lumar became aware that a dragon, xisis, has been living beneath the crimson sea. it is unknown when exactly xisis arrived on the planet, though he was likely already there during the true desolation of roshar. over the centuries, lumar became better-known to the people of the wider cosmere, enough so for rare visitors to begin appearing. around three hundred years after the iriali's disappearance, stories of people from the stars became grew popular among sailors, and common folk could trade with the ""wizards"" from outer space, leading to some proliferation of invested technology. at some point, an elantrian named riina moved to the planet; landing her ship on an island in the midnight sea, she took control of the midnight essence there and dubbed herself the sorceress. the sorceress soon attained fearsome reputation with the locals, due to both her awakened guards, and the curses she would put on people who inconvenienced her. she also imposed tariffs on all trade going through the midnight sea, which eventually led to conflict with the king of the nearby verdant. eventually, the king attempted to send charlie, a son of one of his dukes, to marry the sorceress, which only led to her capturing him and transforming him into a rat. however, tress, chasing after charlie, found her way to the sorceress, and, with the assistance of hoid and the crew of crow's song, managed to force riina to abandon the planet. this led to tress and her crew taking charge of the midnight sea and the creatures within. nations[edit] as lumar is a planet of islands, there are no solid borders between various states; islands declare their allegiance by flying the flag of the local king or queen. each ocean appears to be its own state, with the sorceress controlling whole of the midnight sea, and an unnamed king theoretically ruling over every island on the verdant sea. verdant sea[edit] the verdant sea is ruled by a feudal system, with dukes, reigning over individual islands, answering to a king. the king controls all ships that sail between the islands, and can press them into service as needed for his own purposes. he has several groups that can enforce his will; those include both the standing army and the marshalls who keep the peace, as well as the tax collectors and inspectors who control the coming and going of ships and cargo. additionally, the king is rumoured to have a team of assassins and special agents known as the king's masks. however, it is unclear whether they are real or made up as propaganda. pirates act as an important part to the economy, taking it from the wealthy who hoard money that they gather from the people, and inject it back into the system. due to this, they exist in a sort of quasi-legal state. the verdant sea feuds with the midnight sea; as all trade to the other side of the planet must go through midnight, the sorceress has imposed high tariffs. the king eventually refused to pay them and began to prepare for war until tress and her crew banished the sorceress. the verdant sea borders the crimson sea, the rose sea, and the sapphire sea. known settlements[edit] sapphire sea[edit] the sapphire sea borders the verdant sea. islands of lobu[edit] ""“it is a mark of pride among my people, and my family in particular, to execute an excellent hunt. ”-fort"" the other known society on lumar are the people of islands of lobu, who have dark skin and black, curly hair. the people of lobu are a society of hunters who take pride in the prey they catch. tales of the greatest hunts are written down with great embellishments and a lot of bragging; such letters are then hung on the walls of their family halls. over the generations, what constitutes a hunt has been stretched to include many seemingly-unrelated professions, such as trade or shoemaking, to allow the society to develop without losing their culture. however, no matter the shape the hunt takes, the pride remains. a person chooses their hunt as they come of age, and then pursues it to the best of their ability; for example, a person who chose trade may become an excellent haggler. rose sea[edit] the rose sea is known to be inhabited, though nothing is known of its government or culture. iriali[edit] ""“they vanished, you know. the entire people: poof. there one day, gone the next, their island left uninhabited. ”-charlie"" at one point, there was an island on lumar inhabited by the iriali. however, roughly three hundred years before tress and charlie were born, the entire population vanished seemingly overnight. while it's possible that they simply departed the planet, their fate is unknown to the locals, with some claiming that they were ""taken"" by the gods. today, only some of the iriali's possessions, as well as cultural memory of their golden hair, remain on the planet. notably, the iriali's departure occurred at roughly the same time that xisis become a known presence on lumar. there is, however, no evidence that those two events are at all related. it's unknown what, if any relation there is between the iriali of lumar and the iriali of the rosharan kingdom of iri. the timing of the lumarans' departure from their planet makes it impossible for them to be the rosharans' ancestors,[fn 1] but it is impossible to determine if the lumarans were descended from the inhabitants of roshar, or if they were a different, separate group within the same cosmere-wide culture. culture and society[edit] the human civilization on lumar is pre-industrial; they do, however, possess some particular technologies to assist them in surviving the planet's unforgiving oceans. ships use the seethe to sail between the inhabited islands, leading to well-developed trade. silver is common, with every ship having plenty of it in its deck and railing to help kill the spores. salted masks are sometimes used as means of personal protection from the spores, although it is possible to travel semi-safely without them. as salt is a secondary way of dealing with spores, salt mining is an important industry on the planet. the people of lumar have found ways to live on many of the islands; where farming is impossible, they grow food in compost vats, and even ferry soil from other lands. lumarans have even attempted to fly to the moons, though it's unknown if they succeeded. religion[edit] ""“i follow the path of the gods themselves by delivering death indiscriminately. to do otherwise would presume i am greater than they. ”-crow"" the primary religion on lumar appears to be lunar worship, which is disseminated by groups of priests gathered into various moonschools. the priesthood appears to be comprised of traveling preachers, who visit various islands to teach people their moonschool's philosophy about life and the gods. such sermons typically happen on moondays, when the sun is eclipsed by one of the moons, at the highest point of the given island. another day of celebration for this religion is that of twelveday. little is known about the details of moon worship. there appear to be named figures tied to the moons, with the midnight moon being referred to as ""thanasmia's own"". gods seem to be considered callous, with no regards to whom they kill and what fate they bestow upon people, though that interpretation may be personal to crow rather than generally-accepted. sailing and piracy[edit] ""“it was a mixed crew, with a variety of ethnicities and nearly as many women as men. that wasn't uncommon in the spore seas. you took whoever was willing. sexism interfered with profits. ”-hoid on crow's song"" ships are plentiful on lumar; typically, they have a crew of around thirty or more, with sixty being considered particularly large. a typical ship will have roughly the same proportion of male and female crew members; as very few people are willing to risk sailing the spores, a culture of gender equality has developed among the sailors. however, not all who sail the seas are there willingly -- on verdant sea, and possibly others, people who fall into debt can be pressed into ship labor by the king's collectors. piracy is a common and accepted part of sea travel on lumar. pirate ships chase down the merchant vessels and shoot only to disable, using water-filled cannonballs to activate the spores and trap the ships in them. a captured merchant ship then surrenders an agreed-upon sum of goods and money -- called a ransom price -- whereupon both ships part ways somewhat amicably. the king's marshals keep records of what ships prey on others and what was robbed and stolen; in the event that a pirate crew is captured, this avoiding of unnecessary killing ensures that they are imprisoned rather than executed. pirates are an important part of the economy, taking wealth from the rich, who simply hoard large amounts of wealth gathered from the people through the capitalistic systems in place on lumar, therefore removing it from the system and keeping it from the people. they then inject it back into the system as a stimulus to help lower class merchants and other peoples. there is, however, a second type of pirates, called deadrunners. unlike regular pirates, those crews kill those they steal from. deadrunners are shunned even by other pirate crews, and face death in the event of capture. however, deadrunners can easily never be discovered, should they leave no survivors of their massacres. spore use[edit] while lumar is pre-industrial in its technology, its people have figured out multiple ways to use spores of the twelve seas in their daily life, particularly as it pertains to sailing. those who work with spores and create machinery utilizing them are known as sprouters. one of the more common applications of spores is in firearms. lumar does not appear to have discovered gunpowder; instead, zephyr spores are used. individual spores, or small sacks of them, are packed into the bottom of the gun barrel and the fuse is wetted rather than set aflame. this activates the zephyr, resulting in an explosion of air that launches the projectiles. in larger guns, the cannonballs themselves utilize spore-based technology, combining verdant, roseite and zephyr to create an explosive charge of water and shrapnel. outside of weapons, spores do have peaceable applications. roseite is grown as a form of temporary bandage for ships, the crystal creating patches that temporarily fill in any gaps in the hull. sunlight spores are used as fuel in cooking ovens, and verdant vines can be eaten as emergency food. a more advanced use of the spores can be found in the emergency flare guns. much like cannonballs, flare guns utilize a combination of roseite, verdant and zephyr to create an explosive charge; additionally, sunlight spores serve as the source of the flare's light. riina claims that more types of advanced spore guns can be found elsewhere on the planet. external influences[edit] ""“she'd heard stories of visitors from the stars, but had thought them fancies. even if there did seem to be more and more of them these days, talked of among sailors. ”-tress"" few worldhoppers visit lumar, although enough that stories of ""visitors from the stars"" have began to spread across the planet. as most lumarans are not wholly cosmere-aware, a variety of folk beliefs about the visitors arose. those outsiders are often referred to as wizards or sorcerers, while kandra are called zombies. their advanced technology is considered magical in and of itself, and has found its way into the hands of the locals. tablets from nalthis can be purchased and used for basic needs such as writing out text; however, it appears that the lumarans are never actually taught the details of how the technology works. some scadrian influences have also made their way to the planet, with death being said to have nails in his eyes -- presumably referring to marsh. notable outsiders to make their home on lumar include the sorceress, an elantrian who took control of the midnight sea, and xisis, a dragon who studies the aethers at the bottom of the crimson sea and trades wishes for local servants. those two have integrated into the planet's culture well enough that they are not recognized as extraterrestrials. unlike first of the sun, there does not appear to be any major interstellar nation vying for control over lumar; it's unknown if this is due to the deadly ecosystem, or the planet's relative unimportance on the galactic scene. notable inhabitants of lumar[edit] trivia[edit] - the word ""lumar"" was coined by - , who came up with multiple names for the planet and presented them to brandon. it was meant to evoke both fairy tales and the inspiration for - , - . - it is most likely a portmanteau of the latin words ""luna"" (moon) and ""mare"" (sea;

Nananav,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Nananav,"brightness nananav is the mistress of rockfall in kholinar on roshar. she is impersonated by shallan davar. appearance and personality[edit] nananav is a middle aged lighteyed alethi woman with a bun of hair almost as tall as she is. she is an arrogant and talkative person. she looks down on servants and tradespeople and is generally difficult to deal with. history[edit] during the period of aesudan's negligent rule in kholinar, shallan was tasked with infiltrating the cult of moments. she and her team (including ishnah, vathah, and red) hatched a plot to infiltrate the rockfall mansion to steal some food and ""buy"" their way into the cult. when the everstorm hit kholinar, it had damaged rockfall's rugs. nananav was very particular about the way they were to be repaired, claiming to ishnah (who was posing as a rug merchant) that they were woven by a blind shin man. nananav said that she commissioned the unique rugs and that she would not have them returned even a shade off the original coloring. shallan used lightweaving to impersonate nananav's voice and distract her guards. she then used an illusion to physically impersonate nananav to gain access to her food storage. while wearing the illusion, shallan felt herself take on aspects of nananav's personality; she even briefly considered permanently taking her place, but was able to suppress this desire by dropping the illusion. shallan and her team stole food and wrapped it in rugs to smuggle it out of the mansion, but nananav noticed the theft before they could get away and sent her guards to stop them. shallan put an illusion of nananav's face back on and let it ""melt"" off, distracting the guards and horrifying the real nananav. one of the guards managed to hit shallan in the head with a crossbow bolt, but she recovered. shallan ended up giving the stolen food to local beggars such as grund to attract the attention of the cult of moments, rather than try to buy her way in directly. notes[edit]"
Panatham,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Panatham,"panatham is a city in babatharnam on roshar. geography[edit] panatham lies in central babatharnam, west of the purelake. it is presumably the nation's largest city during the era of solitude and it may be the capital, as it is the only city labeled on available maps. the city contains one of the ten oathgates that are linked to urithiru. the oathgates are known to be ancient, implying that a city has existed in panatham's location since at least the heraldic epochs. history[edit] prior to the battle of thaylen field, dalinar kholin discussed potential places that the voidbringers could attack, as well as locations of strategic interest. he suspected that the iriali and riran armies-who allied with the voidbringers-may have captured panatham and its oathgate. notes[edit]"
Deadrunner,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Deadrunner,"deadrunners are one of the two types of pirates on the planet of lumar. they are most notably notorious for being the type of pirates that will kill a person, or as tress put it; ""...an entire ship's worth of people."" culture[edit] piracy is a common and accepted part of sea travel on lumar, and in the emerald sea the king's marshals keep records of all known pirates. however, unlike regular pirates, if you are known as a deadrunner and are caught or captured by the kings sailors, you will likely be hanged, rather than simply imprisoned as a regular pirate would be. it is possible for deadrunners to remain unknown and avoid discovery if they leave no survivors from their attacks, to spread news of their existence. pirate crews will often trade, sell or bargain crew members from other ships in order to augment their crews, as in the case of captain crow bargaining to get hoid on her ship, however; it is common knowledge that no one will accept a crew from a deadrunner ship. ann notes that there is no mercy shown to deadrunner crews, and in fact, even other pirates will hate you. there is little hope of pardon if you are a deadrunner. only the verdant king can grant this, and only in extreme cases, such as a king's mask vouching for the crew would be considered enough to make the king enact a pardon. it is highly likely that the crew of the two cups (formerly crow's song) is the only deadrunner crew to ever be pardoned. ""“then you become a deadrunner, no mercy for you if caught. even other pirates will hate you. ”-ann"" captain crow notes that deadrunners generally live lives of opulence, but only in frenzied outbursts. and as most deadrunner lives are bound to be short, that opulence should be enjoyed quickly. she also believes that being a deadrunner is synonymous with being one step away from death. crew of crow's song[edit] the crew of the crow's song made the decision to leave behind the life of a successful merchant vessel and crew, and instead follow captain crow into a life of piracy, they had no intention of becoming deadrunners. this title was forced upon them when captain crow and laggart tricked all of them during the attack on the oot's dream. instead of using standard cannonballs that explode on impact, they instead used cannonballs that exploded after they pierced the side of the ship, releasing their water inside the ship, rather than on the side. this caused the verdent spores to explode inside the ship and on the crew of the oot's dream, effectively sinking the ship and killing the crew. notable deadrunners[edit] - (former) - (former) - (former) - (former) - (former) - (former) - (former) trivia[edit] - tress notes that the consequences for non-deadrunner piracy, is a very civilized process. - pirate flags are ""red on black"" on lumar. notes[edit]"
Akinah Dawnshard mural,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Akinah_Dawnshard_mural,"the akinah dawnshard mural is a supernatural piece of art in the undersea caverns of aimia on roshar. it housed a dawnshard related to change. location[edit] the mural is located in a small room in a network of caves underneath akinah. the room also contains shardplate and soulcaster fabrials, and it is adjacent to a large chamber containing lanceryn skulls. the island and the caves have been protected by the lanceryn and then the sleepless for millenia. few (if any) mortal beings were aware of the mural's existence until rysn and cord found it during the expedition to akinah. appearance[edit] the mural is described as ""grand"" and ""incredible"". circular in shape, it depicts a sun exploding into quarters and then further shattering into sixteen near-symmetrical pieces. inlays of gold foil throughout the mural make it seem to glow on its own rather than merely reflecting outside light. red foil inlays trace the outer lines of the mural to create depth and give definition to the pieces. parts of the shattered sun are surrounded by written characters, artistically stylized to curl around the outside of the mural. the writing is not dawnchant or any other language known on roshar. the sleepless are able to detect the presence of the dawnshard in the mural, seemingly using specialized hordelings to do so. history[edit] the provenance of the akinah dawnshard mural is unknown. humans are thought to have used at least one dawnshard to devastate ashyn before settling on roshar, but the details of this event have been lost. according to unkalaki songs, the change dawnshard came to roshar through cultivation's perpendicularity in the horneater peaks. at some point, the dawnshard became the mural. it is unclear how this happened, but the mural itself was not mundane. the mural predates the functional extinction of the lanceryn that occurred during the scouring of aimia. it likely predates the recreance since nikli mentioned that the aimians of the heraldic epochs had kept many secrets with the assistance of the knights radiant. discovery by cord and rysn[edit] when the wandersail made landfall on akinah in late 1174, chiri-chiri followed luckspren underwater; after escaping the sleepless, rysn and cord did the same. they found themselves in a network of caves without any apparent exit, and tentatively explored them. when rysn saw the mural, she was strongly drawn to it, while cord barely seemed to notice it. rysn seemed to feel both heat and emotions radiating from the sun in the mural. she believed it was not angry about the event that was depicted, but she had some difficulty discerning other emotions that it was projecting. the mural called to her, putting pressure on her mind and even speaking to her directly about chiri-chiri and the sleepless. rysn turned her attention away from the mural, but felt it getting increasingly warm; it seemed to loom over her. when she looked at it again, it told her to ""change"", and she accepted it. although she initially felt that the command wanted to merge with her, she later realized that it did not have a will and that she had made the choice to accept it. light streamed from the mural into rysn's eyes and then consumed her. when this process was completed, the mural was simply a piece of art, and rysn had become the dawnshard. when nikli discovered rysn and cord, he did not immediately realize what had happened to the mural. after a brief discussion, he noticed that something was wrong, and his hordelings quickly confirmed that the dawnshard was no longer in the mural. the sleepless had no idea that it could have been absorbed by a human. although nikli was enraged, rysn and cord managed to cut a deal to ensure their safety, and they agreed to never speak of the mural to anyone. speculation[edit] - the mural appears to depict the - of - . although there are known to be four dawnshards and sixteen shards, brandon has been intentionally vague regarding the layout of the mural and what it could mean for the relationship between the two. - since the dawnshard is thought to have come to roshar through a - and the writing on the mural is not in any known rosharan language, - it could be a language that originates off-world. trivia[edit] - the mural bears some superficial similarities to the - symbol. they are related in the sense that they follow the same general design principles. notes[edit]"
Sighted,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sighted,"the sighted (unkalaki: alaii'iku) are rosharans with the ability to see spren that are otherwise partially or completely invisible in the physical realm. the few known sighted are unkalaki, including lunamor and cord. abilities[edit] sighted can see spren in the physical realm even when the spren does not want to be seen. they can see both lesser spren and (sapient) true spren. the spren are generally unaware that they are being observed unless the sighted person acknowledges them. the sighted do not have to activate this ability and it does not require stormlight or other forms of investiture. therefore, they tend to see spren everywhere; they do not know if other people can or can't see them. they consider spren to be gods; true spren are considered to be more important than lesser spren, and other beings such as hoid and the sleepless are even higher on their hierarchy of gods. a sighted person sees spren as if they were visible in the physical realm. for example, anticipationspren and luckspren are known to have relatively large bodies in the cognitive realm, but the sighted see the partial manifestations that typically appear in the physical realm. the same is true of sapient spren; sylphrena usually appears in the physical realm at about a handspan tall while phendorana appears human-sized, and this is how lunamor sees each of them. limitations[edit] sighted people have a limited ability to see ""shadows"" of a spren's true form, but they cannot look directly into the cognitive realm like radiants or fused who use the surges of transportation or transformation. sighted may not be able to see spren that are corrupted by sja-anat since lunamor was not able to see glys despite actively looking for him. additionally, certain voidspren such as chaosspren are thought to be completely invisible, and it is unclear if a sighted could see them. origin[edit] ""“oh! you did not know? i see spren, even those that do not want to be seen. he is a gift, to my family, and others of my kin. ”-cord, to rysn"" the abilities of the sighted have a genetic component that is related to the partial singer ancestry of the unkalaki. singers seem to be innately capable of seeing the true physical realm forms of lesser spren, although their abilities may not extend to true spren. lunamor has implied that he was born with his abilities, although he also hints at the horneater oceans being somehow involved. it may be possible for other people with singer ancestry (such as herdazians) to be sighted, but this has not been observed. the ability seems quite rare, as it is not well-known to most rosharans, and may be limited to lunamor's extended family. cultivation's perpendicularity, which is located in the horneater oceans, does seem to have some relationship to the sighted. the sleepless refer to the sighted as the longtime guardians of the perpendicularity and do not wish to cause them any harm, holding them in even higher esteem than radiants. cord mentions that her people are the guardians of the pool (an unkalaki name for the perpendicularity), noting that her grandmother held the position of ""watcher of the pool"". lunamor has noted that the unkalaki can commune with gods in the pool, but he refuses to elaborate on how it relates to his abilities. history[edit] the most prominent sighted during the true desolation were lunamor and his daughter cord. they knew that they had been given a rare gift, but it was part of their everyday life. they tended to forget that most ""lowlanders"" had never met anyone who could see invisible spren and would typically be amazed to learn that this was possible. they generally did not attempt to hide the fact that they were alaii'iku, although they were not very forthcoming regarding the unkalaki history and traditions related to their abilities. cord was selected to participate in the expedition to akinah because she was sighted, and her abilities helped to unlock the secrets of the island. known sighted[edit] - (rock) - other members of cord and lunamor's family, - presumably including - and cord's grandmother trivia[edit] - is able to see spren, but this is presumably due to his high level of - . - is able to both see - and touch spren, - but she is not known to have unkalaki ancestry; her ability likely comes from the - . - the planned novella - will explore several unkalaki traditions, including the sighted. notes[edit]"
Battar,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Battar,"""“sweet wisdom of battar. ”-a rosharan saying"" battar is one of the ten heralds of the almighty on roshar. she is the patron of the order of elsecallers. she may currently reside in kharbranth as an ardent under the assumed name of dova. attributes and abilities[edit] battar is an immortal cognitive shadow who gains a physical body upon each return to roshar. after death, she is transported to braize to be tortured; when she or another herald breaks, a new desolation begins. during the heraldic epochs, she wielded an honorblade. it granted her access to the surges of transformation, which enables her to soulcast, and transportation, which allows for travel to and from shadesmar. she has, however, abandoned it at aharietiam. she seems to be fairly knowledgeable, being ascribed the attribute of wise, and noticing signs of an upcoming desolation years before the battle of narak. history[edit] battar was born on ashyn and made the trip to roshar during the expulsion. she was someone important in the pre-desolations society -- a queen, scholar, or general. along with the others, she approached honor and formed the oathpact. whenever a desolation ended, she'd travel along with them to braize, where she suffered torture until one of them broke. she broke at least once, starting a new desolation. eventually, she and the other heralds grew exhausted with this endless cycle of war and torture. when ishar suggested that one person might be enough to hold the oathpact, she and the others abandoned taln to his fate, leaving their honorblades behind. from then on out, they hid among the human populace. most of her actions in the intervening four and a half millennia are unknown. as dova, she supposedly approached taravangian and warned him of a coming desolation, which prompted him to seek out szeth after king gavilar's assassination. she has since been assisting the diagram. sometime prior to taravangian seizing of the throne of jah keved, she reported that the frequency of death rattles had been declining further, hinting at moelach's movement. she was later assigned with writing an anonymous essay revealing dalinar and elhokar's decision to make the former a highking, to undermine dalinar's authority along with the revelations of the translated eila stele. with the fulfillment of the diagram taravangian instructed his followers to no longer trust battar as he feared for her mental state after seeing the other heralds. culture[edit] ""“battah send that girl some sense to go with her intelligence. ”-navani kholin"" battar has been worshipped since the silver kingdoms epoch, with people swearing by her name even in-between the desolations. in the modern vorin tradition, she's known as battah'elin, and is associated with the number seven (betab), the essence of tallow, the gemstone zircon, and the attributes wise and careful. there is a temple to her in several major vorin cities. the temple of battah in thaylen city is particularly notable -- it is the oldest in the city, and a must-see location for every arriving dignitary. trivia[edit] - battar's portrait used in the chapter arches is called the counselor by the - staff. - battar is the only - to not yet have an official depiction. notes[edit]"
Summary:Words of Radiance,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Words_of_Radiance/Summary,"this page contains a chapter by chapter summary of words of radiance. we hope this summary will make it easier to find specific areas of the book, as well as providing a quick plot refresher for anyone who doesn't want to take the time to reread the entire book. prologue: to question[edit] jasnah leaves the feast celebrating the signing of the alethi treaty with the parshendi. on her way to a clandestine meeting that she had scheduled, she notices her shadow pointing the wrong way. her shadow slowly returns to normal, but she is disconcerted. this is not the first time this has happened to her, and she wonders if she is cursed. as she continues, she observes a group of oily black figures materialize before her. jasnah then transfers to shadesmar for the first time. she almost drowns in the sea of beads before figuring out how to form the beads into the shape of one of the palace hallways. one of the figures approaches her drawing a sword and jasnah manifests a statue of talenel to protect herself. the figure bows to her while his companions whisper to each other, and jasnah is transferred back to the physical realm. she notices that the lanterns near her have been drained of stormlight. she hurries on to the meeting, where she tells the assassin liss that she only wants her brother's wife, aesudan, watched for now. jasnah reminds liss of their first agreement, according to which jasnah will match payment of any offer made against a member of her family, in exchange for the name of whoever tried to have them assassinated. as she leaves jasnah hears the parshendi's drums cease. as she walks she encounters nale and another man discussing an individual named ash as well as what jasnah believes is a shardblade. continuing on, jasnah hears screams and starts running, following a trail of destruction that leads to her father's rooms. she watches as szeth collapses the balcony beneath himself and gavilar. she begins to cry as he stands over her father and wonders what he is doing. when he walks away she sees that her father is dead, his blade having appeared next to him, and despairs over failing in her efforts to protect her family. members of the parshendi ruling council, including klade, gangnah, and varnali, approach jasnah and apologize. they confess to hiring szeth to assassinate gavilar, claiming he was about to do something very dangerous. part one: alight[edit] chapter 1: santhid[edit] ""to be perfectly frank, what has happened these last two months is upon my head. the death, destruction, loss, and pain are my burden. i should have seen it coming. and i should have stopped it."" the chapter opens with shallan sketching shadesmar aboard tozbek's ship, the wind's pleasure, sailing south of roshar. while sketching, she notices a pattern appear on her sketch. this marks the first time pattern manifests in the physical realm, appearing as an embossed sequence of complex lines with sharp angles and repeated arrowhead shapes. the appearance of pattern startles shallan, causing her to drop her sketches which yalb collects for her. shortly thereafter, a scout spots something in the water which turns out to be a santhid - a large, rare sea creature viewed by sailors as good luck and whose shell is the only thing anyone ever sees. seeing an opportunity, shallan decides she needs to sketch the first ever picture of a living santhid. after much debate with yalb and tozbek, and after conversing with jasnah about shadesmar and spren in some detail for the first time, the sailors finally agree to allow shallan to be lowered over the side of the boat to get a look at the santhid. jasnah tells shallan that she has spoken to navani about the possibility of repairing the soulcaster shallan possesses so that her brothers can give it back to the ghostbloods. shallan is also informed that she has been betrothed to adolin kholin, which she accepts willingly. chapter 2: bridge four[edit] ""our first clue was the parshendi. even weeks before they abandoned their pursuit of the gemhearts, their pattern of fighting changed. they lingered on the plateaus after battles, as if waiting for something."" kaladin rides out the first highstorm since being freed in a small room attached to his mens' new barracks within dalinar's war camp. upon exiting the room he is greeted with cheers by his men who have been shaving their beards during the storm with rock's razor. kaladin contemplates the betrayals of both sadeas and amaram while speaking with skar, teft, and moash about how to proceed training the newly freed bridgemen. there are some 1,000 men situated in 20 now empty buildings in dalinar's camp; buildings recently emptied after the betrayal of sadeas and the subsequent loss of soldiers. kaladin decides they will find the most eager bridgemen and train them personally, sending them back to pass on their training to larger groups of bridgemen, all of whom have been given permission to leave as free men although the majority of them have not done so. kaladin says his worst case scenario plan is to have all 1,000 men trained and able to leave the war camp as a cohesive band of mercenaries if it comes to that. having been named captain by dalinar, the highest rank dalinar dared appoint a darkeyes, kaladin plans to name sigzil, rock, teft, moash, and skar lieutenants. rock will be quartermaster with lopen as his second, teft will be in charge of training, sigzil will be the clerk, and moash, skar, and kaladin will be mainly in charge of guarding dalinar, who they have mutually agreed after some discussion, is their best hope for remaining free men. later, the men previously of bridge four visit a tattooist. the tattooist sets about covering the slave brands with tattoos of freedom, including some details of who freed them and when. first hobber decides he wants a bridge four glyph added and after this decision, the rest demand the same. not to indicate freedom from bridge four, but to embrace the unity they found there. even those members of bridge four who were without slave brands opt to get the tattoo including shen, most on their foreheads though moash chooses to get it on his arm. finally kaladin sits for his tattoo but the ink will not take - his stormlight expelling it - even after banishing his stormlight until the tattoo is set, the ink immediately melts away when he again sucks in stormlight. after leaving, kaladin and his men walk through the war camp noting the general mood. kaladin decides the camp has an air of dread to it following sadeas' betrayal. the men receive bridge four salutes from a few people they pass, kaladin wondering where they even learned the salute. the men visit the head quartermaster, rind, to discuss uniforms for the bridgemen. rind hands out what's left of the old cobalt guard uniforms and the men try them on, eventually coming to admire how they look in them. after some discussion with kaladin, explaining to him that they all identify as bridge four despite being free, kaladin requests that rind commission new bridge four glyph patches for the uniforms. chapter 3: pattern[edit] ""soldiers reported being watched from afar by an unnerving number of parshendi scouts. then we noticed a new pattern of their penetrating close to the camps in the night and then quickly retreating. i can only surmise that our enemies were even then preparing their stratagem to end this war."" shallan sits in her cabin on the wind's pleasure reading a book written by jasnah about vorinism and the recreance and its effect on the documentation of history, such as the existence of shadesmar. while studying, pattern shows up again, this time on the cabin wall, vanishing when she looks directly at it. shallan notes the similarity between pattern and the symbol headed creatures she had seen previously. she immediately attempts to sketch the pattern, drawing many creationspren, though she found it difficult to capture the precise pattern. when finished, the pattern seems to leave the paper and move to the floor. jasnah comes to shallan's room just as shallan leaves to find her. shallan catches a glimpse of what jasnah explains to her is her own spren, just as she tells shallan that the pattern is shallan's spren, a cryptic. jasnah explains about the knights radiant and the orders, explaining that their soulcasting is a shared surge, but that their orders are not the same, judging by their different spren. a lengthy discussion of the nature of spren and jasnah's opinions of the almighty and the heralds follows. chapter 4: taker of secrets[edit] ""the next clue came on the walls. i did not ignore this sign, but neither did i grasp its full implications."" dalinar is experiencing another vision. he describes how he is running through what he believes to be the purelake along with about a dozen armed and armored men, though he notes that they are clad in ancient leather armor. at first he is unsure if they are running away from something or toward something, until he notices a fortress apparently made completely out of onyx. his group meets up with another one led by a knight radiant in deep red glowing plate. dalinar thus determines that this vision takes place before the recreance. the radiant informs them that caeb thought he saw something and tells them to look around. when one of the men hears dalinar mumbling to himself, as he describes what is happening, he tells dalinar to look for a spren that isn't behaving the way it should because spren that were touched by sja-anat are different. dalinar repeats the words quietly, hoping that navani will record them, when he notices that the female knight is talking to apparently nobody. as he looks around he sees a face of shadow with red eyes in the water. when he points this out to the others, the knight, after noting that this is sja-anat's spy, sends caeb to the checkpoint and tells the others to keep watching for the carrier. dalinar chases after the spren while describing it, when it is suddenly joined by a six-foot-tall spren. as the second one dives into the rock, dalinar stumbles back. he gets pulled back further by one of the men as the ground starts to tremble. dalinar watches as the spren, having somehow apparently animated the rock, starts to climb out of the rock with its new rock body. the soldiers, recognizing it as a thunderclast, start yelling for hammers. chapter 5: ideals[edit] ""the sign on the wall proposed a greater danger, even, than its deadline. to foresee the future is of the voidbringers."" kaladin kaladin and the members of bridge four listen to a crier read dalinar's proclamation. the proclamation states that all gemhearts won in battle will now belong to the king, and shares of that wealth will be apportioned at the crown's discretion. the men are concerned that this will sow even more discontent among the highprinces, making their job as bodyguards to dalinar more difficult. kaladin orders rock to start training cooks for the other bridgeman barracks, hoping it will make them less despondent, then heads to the pinnacle to relieve skar's team. on the way, syl worries that kaladin no longer laughs. once at the king's palace, kaladin is allowed to stay for a meeting consisting of dalinar, king elhokar, adolin, navani, renarin, general khal, and his wife teshav. teshav reports that the highprinces are irate. they had hoped that dalinar would reconsider, and sending the proclamation out to the public has provoked them. elhokar says that it is a disaster, and fears that they'll be dead before the week is out. dalinar says he'll unite the kingdom or destroy it trying. the proclamation was made in order to re-focus the highprinces' attention on the war, and dalinar did this knowing that it would enrage them. he wants the highprinces angry, to remind them of why they came to the shattered plains in the first place. he then announces his intention to ""disarm"" the highprinces by having adolin begin dueling for the shardblades and shardplate in their armies. lastly, when prompted on his endgame, dalinar states his intention to refound the radiants. he isn't sure why exactly he needs to do this, but he knows he has to. sadeas meanwhile, torol sadeas sits in front of an elaborate stone table with oathbringer stuck through it. he thinks about how often he had lusted after the weapon, but now possessing it feels hollow. his wife ialai enters the room, and mentions that she has used dalinar's heavy recruitment drive to place more spies in his war camp. they talk about how the other highprinces hate the proclamation, and plan to fan the flames of discontent. torol wants conquest. he plans to let dalinar alienate the other highprinces and fracture the kingdom, at which point he will ""forge a new alethkar from flame and tears"". chapter 6: terrible destruction[edit] ""we had never considered that there might be parshendi spies hiding among our slaves. this is something else i should have seen."" shallan sits on the deck of the wind's pleasure, bundled up because of the cold. she's observing and taking notes on the complex geometric spren, who she had named pattern. pattern asks about the concept of food and replies, ""terrible! destruction!"" when shallan describes eating. shallan notes that pattern is connecting increasingly complex thoughts. when she asks him about his first memories, pattern starts to vibrate and shallan can hear wind blowing through branches, and the deck starts to turn to a dirt path in front of her. shallan is horrified and the images vanish. just then, yalb comes over and introduces her to ""new kid"", a six-foot-tall hulk of a man. yalb tricks new kid into doing galley duty for him, which pattern seems to like. shallan asks him if he likes lies, to which pattern replies that he likes ""good lies ... true lies."" shallan heads below deck to her cabin where she gets caught up in her research. hours go by before she closes her books, and her spheres are getting dim. she feels satisfied, her life seems to finally be coming together. she fishes some newly-restored spheres out of her safepouch to replace those in the goblet, but strangely they are completely dun. when she goes to ask jasnah for some new spheres, shallan notices that jasnah is uncharacteristically disconcerted. she seems exhausted, and her poise has been replaced by worry. they discuss the return of surgebinding, and jasnah asks that shallan focus on learning the illumination surge rather than soulcasting, as the latter can be dangerous. jasnah also reveals that she is worried about the parshmen, who she thinks are secretly the voidbringers. they worry that because the parshmen are so integrated into vorin society they could cause utter collapse if they rebelled. jasnah speaks of how in ages past, the heralds would return before desolations and train the knights radiant. she reveals that she hopes to find a path to urithiru, the legendary city of the knights radiant, in the shattered plains. there she will try to find information that will convince the alethi leaders to expel the parshmen. before shallan leaves, jasnah gives her a book that contains information on the order of lightweavers. the book is called words of radiance. shallan goes to sleep planning to read the book in the morning. she is awoken by screams, shouts, and smoke. chapter 7: open flame[edit] ""i was unprepared for the grief my loss brought--like an unexpected rain--breaking from a clear sky and crashing down upon me. gavilar's death years ago was overwhelming, but this . . . this nearly crushed me."" shallan wakes up in a panicked state, and rushes out of her cabin into the passageway. she sees three men holding torches with their backs to her, and one of them throws jasnah's body to the deck, then stabs her through the heart. she screams, recognizing one of the men as a new sailor, and returns to her cabin, locking the door. the men break down the door, but fail to see shallan as she manages to draw in stormlight then create an illusion of shadow to hide in, and another visible moving image for them to chase to another part of the ship. she sends pattern to spy and he tells her the regular sailors are being killed on the main deck. she makes her way to jasnah's cabin, surprised to not trip over her mentor's body in the dark. she finds jasnah's chest and opens it to access her spheres, and hears as the sailors are being murdered. shallan tells pattern she wants to soulcast the bottom of the ship to sink it and use the confusion to help the sailors, and pattern intercedes, giving her passage to shadesmar. pattern is there also, appearing like a symbol-head. he tells her to find the bead representing the wind's pleasure and persuades it to change and sink so that it can possibly save some of the sailors that it serves. shallan returns to the physical plane and the sinking ship, and starts going under as she cannot find the way out, then something grabs her, dragging her down. chapter 8: knives in the back - soldiers on the field[edit] ""i seek not to use my grief as an excuse, but it is an explanation. people act strangely soon after encountering an unexpected loss. though jasnah had been away for some time, her loss was unexpected. i, like many, assumed her to be immortal."" dalinar watches as highprince aladar's army, which has arrived to the plateau faster than his own, fights the parshendi over a gemheart. dalinar feels bitter and jaded, as he no longer believes the plateau runs represent the fulfillment of the vengeance pact. kaladin and his guards cross a bridge to guard dalinar as he joins aladar on his command plateau adjacent to where the battle is being fought, while adolin and general khal lead the kholin forces to the fight. dalinar joins aladar and tells him that he saved the other highprince from losing, but aladar complains that he will earn less and that he is being punished for being successful. dalinar threatens aladar on the consequences of disobedience, but aladar counters that gavilar didn't use honor to unite the kingdom originally, which strikes a nerve. aladar thinks the parshendi are about to push, but dalinar thinks otherwise, and turns out to be correct about them getting ready to harvest the gemstone and withdraw, and they end up victorious. dalinar notices the parshendi shardbearer watching from a distance, having never entered the battle, and states that this has never happened before. aladar thanks dalinar for his advice, but refuses to trust him regarding politics since he fears betrayal. back in his bunker, he notes there are now sixty days left in the mysterious countdown, and receives a letter announcing that an old friend of his would be coming soon to the shattered plains and might solve some of the problems dalinar is dealing with. chapter 9: walking the grave[edit] ""i wish to think that had i not been under sorrow's thumb, i would have seen earlier the approaching dangers. yet in all honesty, i'm not certain anything could have been done."" kaladin leads the way down into the chasms, accompanied by rock, teft, sigzil, sylphrena, and the forty bridgemen from the reorganized crews who were chosen to practice spears under teft's guidance and become future sergeants. kaladin and syl stroll off, debating the laws of physics and syl jokes about her ability to defy gravity. they discuss dalinar's plan to refound the knights radiant, which syl likes, and the mysterious countdown. syl mentions dangerous red spren that she sees on occasion. kaladin asks if there are other surgebinders and syl says yes, and there are other spren of different types doing what she is, but that she is the only honorspren and that she defied the stormfather to do so. syl tells kaladin to be what dalinar is looking for, and he says that he will try, despite his painful past. rock interrupts them, praising syl and offering to build a shrine dedicated to her. rock says that teft moved their training to a different spot, and says the bridgemen are becoming less reticent. kaladin agrees to allow sigzil to do his testing now to determine the extent of kaladin's abilities. chapter 10: red carpet, once white[edit] shallan believes the world is ending and it is her fault. as her father tries getting her to sleep he wipes some blood from her face and starts singing a lullaby. shallan thinks herself to be a monster that kills and thus unworthy of the love and affection her father is giving her. in the room are two corpses, one a man who bled and one a woman in white - shallan's mother - who lies face-down, hiding her ""horrible eyes."" as shallan and her father pass his safe in the wall, shallan can see the light from the ""monster"" inside of it. after the song ends her father leaves the bedroom closing the door on the corpses. chapter 11: an illusion of perception[edit] ""but, understandably, we were focused on sadeas. his betrayal was still fresh, and i saw its signs each day as i passed empty barracks and grieving widows. we knew that sadeas would not simply rest upon his slaughters in pride. more was coming."" shallan awakes on a rock surrounded by ocean water, just offshore. she sees the santhid that saved her swim off toward the horizon. pattern says that the ship sank and doesn't know if any of the sailors survived. shallan forces herself to accept that jasnah is dead. she manages to tread water and reach the shore. she waits on the beach for a while looking for signs of survivors but sees none. pattern says that he found someone and urges shallan to follow him, and leads her to jasnah's trunk, which contains her books and notes intact in a waterproof enclosure. shallan is unable to build a fire, so she decides to try to soulcast one. pattern eases her into shadesmar, and she sees large, fuzzy-looking, bird-like spren that hover overhead, which are exhaustionspren that are drawn to her. she takes a bead that represents a piece of wood and tries to persuade it that it could be fire, but it prefers to be a stick instead. her sphere is drained of stormlight and she flees from shadesmar, having failed to make a fire start. she gets up and starts walking, though her feet are cut up and bleeding, and ends up encountering a group of strangers around a fire, and due to her state of exhaustion, lays down next to the fire and goes to sleep. shallan wakes up as someone with a thaylen accent addresses her as brightness, but he isn't one of the sailors as she initially thinks. she realizes that they are slavers, led by a man named tvlakv, and asserts herself as she imagines that jasnah would, introducing herself and ordering them to retrieve jasnah's trunk and escort her to the shattered plains, overcoming tvlakv's objections by sheer force of will and gaining his reluctant compliance. chapter 12: hero[edit] ""unfortunately, we fixated upon sadeas's plotting so much that we did not take note of the changed pattern of our enemies, the murderers of my husband, the true danger. i would like to know what wind brought about their sudden, inexplicable transformation."" sigzil finally gets the possibility to 'measure' kaladin's abilities. down in the chasms-while teft and drehy are working with twenty others to train them-kaladin, sigzil, rock, and lopen are doing experiments. lopen guards the location to avoid unbidden guests. they try to measure how long a rock which kaladin infuses with stormlight and sticks to a chasm wall stays stuck. rock hints at spren that pull the stone to the wall. kaladin sees them too, when looking close, but sigzil does not. sigzil takes notes, writing them down in glyphs. and he is confused. he says he would need a clock to properly measure times and that he has no real references to compare. so they start testing other things, things kaladin can do in battle with his stormlight. for example, infusing his spear and making it stick to the spear of a foe or infusing the ground causing others that step on it to topple. for these experiments, lopen and rock join sigzil as sparring partners. it's shown that rock indeed knows how to fight, though he still refuses to do so aside from this sparring for testing kaladin's abilities. teft comes and sees the last part of the sparring. he asks kaladin to release him from his task of training new recruits, but kaladin refuses. when kaladin and his men leave the chasm, a darkeyed soldier tells him that a hero has arrived at dalinar's warcamp. when kaladin hears the man's name, he rushes to dalinar's command complex to see the newcomer with his own eyes. kaladin sees dalinar clutching hands with his old friend, brightlord amaram. interludes[edit] interlude i-1: narak[edit] eshonai leads the parshendi as they return to their home plateau after successfully harvesting a gemheart that was brought back by devi, who is allowed to carry it as a reward for spotting the chrysalis. she wonders where dalinar is, and feels a need to speak with him, but she can't join battles since her leg is still injured from when kaladin stabbed her during the battle of the tower. she wanders through the ancient ruins on the plateau they named narak, or exile, where her people came to escape their gods. she enters the hall of art to observe the heretofore futile efforts to rediscover a new form for making art, as an incremental step towards discovering other more useful forms, but varanis, one of her lieutenants, is unsuccessful in trying to attract creationspren to his novice attempts at painting. she contemplates the six current known forms, and laments the loss of the hundreds that their old songs mention, thinking her people may die off if they don't become more versatile. she leaves the hall, and encounters three mateforms who are playing idly in a pool, and berates them for being unproductive. she reflects back on how she and the rest of the parshendi leaders conspired to assassinate gavilar, to prevent the parshendi gods from returning, at the cost of the slow annihilation of her people. she returns to her home, and finds her sister, venli, and tells her of the plateau run and that dalinar was not present on the alethi side. eshonai says that she wants to talk to dalinar and sue for peace but venli thinks that he wouldn't accept, and says that she discovered stormform. eshonai exclaims that this could cause their gods to return, but venli says that is a moot point since the alethi now have surgebinders, though eshonai isn't sure about this. demid, venli's former mate, agrees that they should risk using stormform to protect their people from being wiped out. venli says she wants to raise the issue with the five, and eshonai says she will consider supporting it. interlude i-2: ym[edit] ym is in his shop trimming a small block of wood. the cobbler had been taught to make the wooden forms himself, so he does. it's the way it's been done for centuries, which is good enough for him. a spren moves in the dimness to his right. it has been coming around more often lately, and ym had never seen one like it before. as it moves it looks like specks of light, like those from a piece of crystal suspended in a sunbeam. when it stops, light creeps upward from it, like small plants growing, which withdraw when it starts moving again. they talk briefly about the shoes, and that ym finds himself needing more shoes for children lately. the spren shakes suddenly, and warns ""he comes."" anxious, ym stands up looking for ""the watcher,"" a man in a military coat, but finds only a child peering through the door. ym invites the urchin in, who's feet are dirty and scraped. the boy is iriali, with their characteristic golden skin and hair, and walks with a limp. ym offers him a pair of shoes in exchange for his story. as the boy speaks, ym cleans his feet to fit the shoes. one of the feet has a nasty cut on the bottom, infected and crawling with rotspren. ym cleans it and puts on antiseptic, then subtly uses some stormlight to heal the cut. they speak of ym's religious beliefs, and the boy leaves after receiving the shoes. the spren whispers ""he's still here,"" and ym spins as he hears a rustling behind him. a dark-skinned man with a crescent scar on his cheek steps out of the shadows in the back of the shop. the man accuses ym of commiting a murder in his youth. ym tells the man that it wasn't intentional, but the man says he is guilty nonetheless, then summons a shardblade. ym runs, but he is old and quickly tires. he stops, trying to pull out a sphere for some stormlight, but the dark-skinned man slams him against a wall and stabs him in the chest with the shardblade. interlude i-3: rysn[edit] rysn is traveling with vstim to the reshi isles to do trading, but vstim is very sick. gu, the flotilla's guide, takes them there, guiding them since the islands move. rysn is quite shocked and amazed when she realizes that the moving islands are huge great shells. the group lands on one of the islands, and vstim tells rysn that she must go and trade with the reshi, as he is too ill to do so. he tells her to be bold, and although rysn is nervous, she agrees to do so. kyrlm and nlent, two of the guards, accompany her as she ascends the island. while rysn is observing the island, she sees axies hanging upside down. they talk for a bit, and then rysn and the guards continue their way up the island. they make it to the king, and as rysn approaches to speak with him, talik, a reshi trader, comes forward to speak on his behalf. talik is disappointed that vstim himself did not come to trade, and initially turns her away. rysn is insistent in her trade, wishing to prove herself to vstim, and the king eventually relents so that rysn is speaking to the king, and not to talik. the reshi are opposed to trading with rysn since they do not yet respect her and do not know if they can trust her. the king eventually dismisses rysn, telling her that she did very well. rysn, worrying that vstim is dying, instead insists on talking to the greatshell that is the island, relu-na. she slides down the side of the head on a rope and begins to talk with it, pleading her case. talik attempts to bring her back on top of the island, but relu-na takes a bite of the fruit at the bottom of the rope and breaks it, causing rysn to fall. as she crashes into the water, relu-na cushioned her fall, and rysn fell unconscious. rysn wakes up in a hut on the island with her legs paralyzed. she sees vstim, a reshi healer, and talik around her. they scold her for her stupidity, but rysn insists that it was boldness, to allow for the trade. rysn realizes that it was all a test that vstim had set up for her to trade, and feels foolish. vstim reveals that the trade was for a larkin corpse, but that rysn has been granted a live larkin by the island itself. vstim and rysn will stay on the island while rysn's legs heal. interlude i-4: last legion[edit] eshonai, thude and bila examine the gemstone with the stormspren inside that will allow for a new form. bila thinks that anything that will help in the war against the alethi is worth it, but eshonai worries about the old gods. they depart, and eshonai decides that she will see her mother. on her way, she sees a group of parshendi that have chosen the dull-form, the form most like the parshmen. eshonai questions them on the cause of their transformation, and they respond that they do it so the alethi will not kill them when they come. part two: winds' approach[edit] chapter 13: the day's masterpiece[edit] ""warform is worn for battle and reign, claimed by the gods, given to kill. unknown, unseen, but vital to gain. it comes to those with the will."" shallan travels towards the shattered plains on one of tvlakv's wagons. she sits next to bluth, one of the stoic mercenaries hired by tvlakv, who drives the wagon. she distracts herself by studying their surroundings - the flora of the southern frostlands is completely unfamiliar to her. when they stop at midday for a meal, shallan asks tvlakv to set up one of the empty slave wagons as a carriage for her. wooden sides, typically used as protection for the slaves during highstorms, are hooked onto the sides of the cage to provide her some privacy. she also gets the cage's key from tvlakv, though he seems hesitant to give it to her. she crawls across the newly enclosed wagon - her feet are injured and standing on them is painful enough to make painspren appear - and opens the lid to jasnah's trunk. pattern, who had been instructed to stay hidden, waits inside. shallan tells him that the notes need to reach the shattered plains, and that she intends to finish jasnah's work of finding urithiru and convincing the alethi that the return of the voidbringers is imminent. pattern confirms that the threat from the voidbringers is real and that they are the reason he was sent to her. as she continues to go through the contents of the trunk, shallan finds a sketch she had done of jasnah and is overcome with grief over her mentor's death, as well as the loss of the rest of her sketches. she also laments the loss of the broken soulcaster, which is at the bottom of the ocean, and speculates that the attackers could have been from the same group as kabsal and her father (the ghostbloods). chapter 14: ironstance[edit] ""mateform meek, for love to share, given to life, it brings us joy. to find this form, one must care. true empathy one must employ."" adolin mentally prepares for his first duel under dalinar's plan by speaking inspirationally to his shardblade. he leaves the preparation room and walks to a staging room, where renarin and navani are waiting to equip his shardplate. navani burns a prayer glyph for safety and glory. adolin inquires about jasnah, and navani replies that her daughter has likely gone missing due to a change of plans, and would reappear at a later time. renarin verifies that adolin finished his lucky pre-duel rituals, and navani scoffs at their superstitions. adolin tells renarin that he has suspicions about kaladin. adolin enters the arena to duel salinor. a large crowd attends as this is the first formal duel at the shattered plains for more than a year. adolin begins in windstance, but thinks of his father's words and switches to ironstance and aggressively battles his opponent into submission, winning despite protests from the highjudge brightlady istow that adolin did not follow proper duel protocols. salinor protests that adolin cheated and adolin threatens to choke him until he surrenders his blade, which salinor then does, and istow proclaims adolin as the official victor. renarin praises adolin's victory, and adolin gifts his new weapon to renarin, who reluctantly accepts it with a frown. navani praises adolin for winning without putting his full ability on display in order to deceive future opponents into underestimating him and accepting duels. chapter 15: a hand with the tower[edit] ""workform worn for strength and care. whispering spren breathe at your ear. seek first this form, its mysteries to bear. found here is freedom from fear."" shallan comments about tvlakv wearing different shoes than on the first day they met, but tvlakv lies and says he only owns one pair. shallan asks pattern to spy on a conversation between tvlakv and tag, and pattern records and replays the chat for shallan in secret, revealing that tvlakv intends to protect shallan, but also to profit from her rescue to try to escape a debt. shallan uses this information to keep tvlakv off-balance and to gain the upper hand in their dealings, warning the trader not to play games after tvlakv expresses doubt over shallan's story about her betrothal and pending wealth. as she gets up to leave, tvlakv flinches away from her, and she notices that she is glowing faintly with stormlight and has a majestic appearance, which she hopes that tvlakv misinterprets as a trick of the darkness and campfire light. she returns to her wagon and notices that the pain in her infected feet has lessened. bluth returns to the camp in a panic, putting out their campfire. bluth tells them that he spotted a likely caravan of army deserters who may have turned to banditry nearby. they quickly pack up the wagons and travel east to try to escape notice. bluth explains to shallan that they probably would not be able to bribe their way past the bandits, since desertion makes them very desperate people. chapter 16: swordmaster[edit] ""nimbleform has a delicate touch. gave the gods this form to many, tho' once defied, by the gods they were crushed. this form craves precision and plenty."" kaladin leads a bodyguard patrol, along with moash and drehy, through the lighteyes training ground as they scout the area while waiting for adolin and renarin. kaladin converses with an ardent who explains the alethi tradition of allowing lighteyes to train with royal shardblades so they are ready if needed in battle. moash asks about kaladin's feelings toward amaram, and says that the two of them will get their revenge on the lighteyes who have wronged them in the past. syl asks kaladin to tell her what is troubling him, and kaladin says that dalinar is tainted by his association with amaram. after syl warns kaladin not to lie, he admits that he thinks dalinar is honorable and has been deceived by amaram. syl advises kaladin to tell dalinar how amaram really got his shardblade, but kaladin demurs, thinking that he would not be believed. on the arrival of renarin and adolin, kaladin reports to them that the area is relatively secure. adolin confronts kaladin over his insolence and mentions his suspicions as well, but kaladin retorts that his place is only to protect adolin. syl tells kaladin she does not like either adolin or renarin, and it is implied this is because they carry shardblades, though syl says the blades did not used to be the abominations she now considers them to be. kaladin surveys the area and sees someone who appears to be suspicious and goes to investigate. kaladin speaks with zahel, an ex-soldier ardent, who is observing adolin and renarin train, and who tells kaladin that he isn't going to harm either of the brothers. zahel says the two kholins need to be chosen by a master, and as he speaks, he is summoned by adolin to join the other gathered ardents. kaladin asks if zahel seems odd to syl, and she replies that all humans seem odd to her except for rock. chapter 17: a pattern[edit] ""dullform dread, with the mind most lost. the lowest, and one not bright. to find this form, one need banish the cost. it finds you and brings you to blight."" shallan sits next to bluth who is guiding their wagon, and distracts herself from worry by talking about plants that she found. she also draws some sketches of a leaf, the santhid, and bluth in one of jasnah's old notebooks, to try to recreate her lost sketch collection. the caravan stops, and shallan sees smoke on the horizon, which indicates that the deserters are following them and not worried about being seen. tvlakv says the deserters will give up the chase eventually as long as they keep moving with few stops. to distract herself further, shallan chats with the two parshmen but they are unforthcoming. shallans sketches more plants, then notices a column of smoke along their current path. tvlakv says that indicates another caravan if they are lucky. they discuss whether to go toward the new group or take a detour east while hoping the deserters run into the second group. shallan orders tvlakv to try to intercept the new group and he complies. as she rides along, she draws more sketches, including various sketches of women with shallan's face. she then moves into the covered wagon to use knobweed sap on her feet and notices they have healed significantly. she asks pattern if it healed her but it seems ignorant of how to cause or heal injuries to humans. shallan and pattern converse about lightweaving and the knights radiant. shallan asks how to use stormlight but pattern doesn't know, so she figures it out on her own and breathes it in, though she is unable to make it do anything. she notices that her wounds heal noticeably however. pattern reveals that it is a scholar and is excited to learn about humans before it is killed by shallan, as it believes will eventually happen due to the knights radiant somehow killing their spren. shallan denies that she is a knight radiant, but pattern refutes this by saying that she spoke oaths and is on a possible path to joining one of the orders. she leaves the wagon and notices a lot of smoke ahead, and realizes that it is from burning wagons. chapter 18: bruises[edit] ""scholarform shown for patience and thought. beware its ambitions innate. though study and diligence bring the reward, loss of innocence may be one's fate."" kaladin and lopen guard adolin and renarin as they take instruction from zahel. lopen leaves to carry out some orders and kaladin patrols the grounds and stops to observe zahel and renarin. zahel tells renarin to jump off the roof of the arena to practice being comfortable with his shardplate. kaladin criticizes renarin's clumsiness but zahel dismisses this and praises renarin's attitude. zahel offers to train kaladin but kaladin declines. zahel tests kaladin's abilities with a blunted shardblade to make sure he is ready to protect adolin and renarin. zahel defeats kaladin in a mock duel, though kaladin did enough simulated damage to slow down the weapons master, and believes he would have given enough protection for renarin to escape. adolin makes an insulting comment which enrages kaladin, and he attacks adolin. adolin smashes kaladin with a plate enhanced punch, and kaladin is stunned and severely injured as zahel berates the prince for his carelessness. kaladin surreptitiously heals himself with stormlight and tries to attack adolin again but runs out of strength and collapses. zahel compliments kaladin on his tenacity and quick-thinking but says it won't be enough against shardbearers, and says he won't force kaladin to train. kaladin asks syl why he lost strength suddenly and syl observes that kaladin was not protecting anyone when it happened. chapter 19: safe things[edit] shallan is wearing a new silk dress, a gift from her father. the dress is that of a woman as she is now old enough to cover her safehand. she starts to think of her mother, then stops, like a candle suddenly snuffed. two maids bustle past, getting ready for guests. shallan overhears one softly whisper ""she saw. poor thing was in the room when it happened. hasn't spoken a word in five months. the master killed his own wife and her lover."" shallan thinks that because she does not speak, apparently the maids do not think she can hear either. at times, she wonders if she is invisible or not real. the door suddenly slams open and her brother helaran enters. grinning wide, he gives her a gift of charcoal pencils and thick, expensive paper. he has missed her drawings and asks her to practice more. he tells her she needs to be strong and that he needs her to look after the other brothers for him. the door slams open again, this time admitting her father, lin davar. her father and brother start arguing, and helaran calls their father a murderer and summons a shardblade. lin cuts off, putting his hands up and says ""you don't know what you think you know. your mother-"", but helaran cuts him off. shallan manages to say ""no"" to helaran, stopping him from killing lin. helaran leaves, saying that he has important work to do, but warns their father that he will be checking in on the house. chapter 20: the coldness of clarity[edit] ""artform applied for beauty and hue. one yearns for the songs it creates. most misunderstood by the artist it's true, come the spren to foundation's fates."" shallan's caravan arrives at the source of the smoke and they find burned wagons and the aftermath of a battle with corpses and some survivors. as shallan and tvlakv debate whether to approach the burning wagons or flee, a woman from those wagons confronts them, and notes the deserters chasing shallan. shallan offers the woman her protection but she laughs and says shallan can join her caravan to die as they now face two possible enemy groups. shallan sends tvlakv to the woman's caravan while she has bluth drive her with a wagon toward the deserters to confront them. using stormlight to weave a disguise to make her appear noble, she speaks to the deserters, asking them for help against the other bandit group and offering amnesty and a fresh start. vathah, the leader of the deserters, scoffs at her offer but many of his followers are enticed and charge toward the battle to fight the bandits. shallan then convinces vathah and the rest to help out. shallan used all her stormlight so she stays out of the fighting. pattern compliments shallan on her ability to use words to transform people without using soulcasting. shallan draws a prayer glyph for hope and awaits the outcome of the battle. chapter 21: ashes[edit] ""mediationform made for peace, it's said. form of teaching and consolation. when used by the gods, it became instead form of lies and desolation."" shallan says a prayer for bluth, who died fighting the bandits, though the bandits ended up being defeated. shallan speaks with the caravan owner, macob, and the lead guard, tyn. shallan explains that she got the deserters to work for her and asks the caravan to accompany them to the shattered plains. macob agrees to shallan's request. vathah forcefully confronts shallan and asks why she doesn't look majestic anymore, and shallan dissembles about his conscience tricking him. shallan tries to reassure vathah that she will protect him from prosecution for desertion but he does not believe her, and pattern tricks vathah into letting shallan go. tvlakv confronts shallan with a conspiracy theory about bluth being a bandit but shallan disproves it and demands the non-parshmen slaves in compensation for saving his life. shallan frees the slaves but offers to hire them as servants. shallan watches as one of the women from the caravan offers a paper with a glyph of thanks written on it to the one-eyed deserter, who accepts it and burns it as the rest of the caravan folks observe. chapter 22: lights in the storm[edit] ""stormform is said to cause a tempest of winds and showers, beware its power, beware its powers. though its coming brings the gods their night, it obliges a bloodred spren. beware its end, beware its end."" kaladin sees a reddish glow through the shutters during a highstorm while in king elhokar's quarters but it vanishes before he can investigate it. adolin peruses a catalog while renarin idly opens and closes a small box. dalinar and navani are nearby in a small side-room. kaladin studies a ruby heating fabrial which renarin says was developed by navani. kaladin makes a brusque comment on adolin's reading material and they argue over whether kaladin needs to be there to protect them during a highstorm, with elhokar taking kaladin's side. after the storm ends, dalinar and navani exit the side-room and dalinar reports that no mysterious numbers have appeared on the wall. dalinar talks to renarin about his visions but stops when he notices kaladin listening. dalinar asks adolin about his progress in setting up more duels and adolin says that he is only getting refusals now. dalinar speaks of the situation with sadeas, and of trying to convince amaram to secede from sadeas' princedom, and of amaram trying to make peace between kholin and sadeas. kaladin states that the shardbearers may be boycotting adolin's requests to duel and dalinar agrees and says they have to focus on undermining sadeas. kaladin speaks to dalinar in private about amaram's betrayal of kaladin and about how he actually got his shardblade. dalinar asks for proof of the serious accusations and kaladin mentions witnesses present at the scene. dalinar tells kaladin to not speak of the incident and pledges to investigate it, and dresses down kaladin over his insubordination. kaladin and syl discuss the conversation with dalinar, and kaladin states that dalinar will not do anything and he will take matters into his own hands. syl replies that kaladin isn't a skybreaker and that she worries about him. kaladin returns to his barracks and notices a new herdazian crew member there who is a cousin of lopen's that abandoned brightlord roion's army and allows him to stay. shen confronts kaladin over his prohibition on being armed, and says he is being treated like a slave, which upsets kaladin. one of the guards from the palace, natam, suddenly appears at the barracks, speaking of an assassin going after the king. chapter 23: assassin[edit] ""nightform predicting what will be, the form of shadows, mind to foresee. as the gods did leave, the nightform whispered. a new storm will come, someday to break. a new storm a new world to make. a new storm a new path to take, the nightform listens."" kaladin returns to the king's quarters to find that everyone is ok and that there is no pending danger. kaladin and moash go out to the balcony and find one of the railings torn loose where elhokar had leaned on it and almost fallen to his death, barely being rescued by a guard. kaladin finds a joint that had been cut clean through and discusses his findings privately with dalinar. kaladin says this was an incompetent or cowardly attempt on the king's life, and that the cut was made by a shardblade which helps them narrow down the possible suspects. dalinar says it must be an inside job, and puts kaladin in charge of guarding elhokar effective immediately. kaladin hears elhokar's complaints about not being protected adequately and thinks the king does not display proper composure, then decides that he should focus on guarding the king and not on judging him. chapter 24: tyn[edit] ""decayform destroys the souls of dreams. a form of gods to avoid, it seems. seek not its touch, nor beckon its screams, deny it. watch where you walk, your toes to tread, o'er hill or rocky riverbed hold dear the fears that fill your head, defy it."" shallan listens to gaz' and red's stories of how they were recruited into the alethi army and how they ended up deserting due to the lack of progress on the vengeance pact because of the greed of the highprinces and because of their service oaths binding them to virtual slavery. vathah derides gaz for being overly solicitous of shallan, but shallan defends gaz and argues that the deserters have redeemed themselves and insults vathah to the point that he leaves. shallan asks about gaz' debt but he refuses to discuss it and leaves. shallan studies jasnah's notes about the shattered plains and urithiru. shallan complains to pattern about how the historians weren't as factual and objective as she would like but pattern says that truth is subjective. shallan and pattern discuss spren and voidbringers, which disturbs pattern, and pattern describes what spren are, mentioning three shards: honor, cultivation and odium, speaking in a high-pitched tone when mentioning the latter name. one of shallan's slaves delivers a summons to visit tyn, and the two get together to eat dinner. tyn asks about shallan's identity and says that she has sent inquiries about shallan davar and deduced that her story is so improbable that shallan is really a con artist and impersonator trying to pull off a scam. tyn offers to help shallan with her con and shallan plays along, implying that she has dangerous secrets about dalinar. chapter 25: monsters[edit] ""smokeform for hiding and slipping between men. a form of power, like human surges. bring it 'round again. though crafted of gods, it was by unmade hand. leaves its force to be but one of foe or friend."" dalinar orders kaladin and bridge four to learn how to ride horses so they can travel more quickly around the camp. moash advises against trusting dalinar but agrees eagerly to learn to ride for the battlefield advantage that horses give. jenet, the stablemaster, is displeased but lectures bridge four on horsemanship. adolin appears but is chased off as jenet tries to hit him with some rocks. after the lecture, kaladin and the others practice riding the horses, which is difficult for kaladin at first though he gains a small amount of proficiency. kaladin questions one of the bridgemen, natam, about the night that elhokar almost fell off the balcony. kaladin realizes the sabotage must have happened after the highstorm. adolin taunts kaladin into abandoning his training horse to ride an untamed horse, though kaladin gives a different reason to syl, saying it is to get over his fear. kaladin mounts the new horse, dreamstorm, using stormlight to adhere himself to the saddle. the horse tires itself out trying to buck kaladin from the saddle, and eventually succeeds when the stormlight runs out. dalinar orders kaladin to start patrolling outside the camps using the horses. kaladin further questions natam who says that he saw moash go onto the balcony after the storm but kaladin dismisses him as a suspect. kaladin seethes with anger as he sees dalinar have a friendly chat with amaram. chapter 26: the feather[edit] ""they blame our people for the loss of that land. the city that once covered it did range the eastern strand. the power made known in the tomes of our clan our gods were not who shattered these plains."" adolin and jakamav lead an alethi charge against the parshendi to capture a gemheart on a pyramid shaped plateau. jakamav mentions that adolin isn't supposed to be there and observes that dalinar is trying to increase cooperation between the highprinces. adolin and jakamav reach the chrysalis but they are too late as eshonai already retrieved the gemheart and gave it to another parshendi who escaped with it. eshonai tells adolin that she wants to parlay with dalinar. adolin agrees to tell dalinar and eshonai says that a messenger will be sent. adolin checks on renarin and finds out from a guard that renarin intended to join battle at one of the bridges but had one of his fits after he summoned his shardblade. jakamav comments that adolin will eventually lose a duel but adolin complains that he is having difficulty getting anyone to accept a duel. jakamav reveals that sadeas has been bribing people to refuse duels but says that adolin should try challenging eranniv. adolin asks to talk about his relationship problems at a winehouse that evening but jakamav declines, stating that it is not popular to be seen around adolin due to dalinar's proclamations. adolin stalks off, frustrated, to ride his horse. renarin tells adolin that he didn't have a fit when he froze on the battlefield and that it was simply fear. adolin notices renarin isn't wearing his glasses. renarin comments cryptically that they need to be ready for the coming storm. chapter 27: fabrications to distract[edit] shallan is outside in the gardens of their estate sketching. she longs to stay out there, where people do not scream at each other, where there is peace. unfortunately, it is a fake peace, cultivated like the garden itself. she hears shouts from the nearby manor house, which cause her to tense up and ruin the sketch she's working on. she thinks of her brother helaran, who brings her the fine sketching paper. his returns home are unpredictable and short, and no one knows where he goes when he leaves. she stares at a blank piece of paper, and loses track of time. eventually noticing the sky has darkened, shallan packs up her things and heads inside. her father has been throwing feasts regularly, and it is almost time for the one tonight. she turns up the stairs to get ready. there would be a new dress for her to wear as she sits quietly. she suspects her father doesn't like that she has begun speaking again. perhaps he does not want her to be able to speak of things she has seen. her mind goes blank. her brother jushu finds her on the stairs, staring at the wall. jushu's jacket is undone and askew, and his cheeks are flush with wine. he has no cuff links or belt, having gambled them away. when asked, jushu tells shallan that he heard the yelling. balat has been starting fires again, and nearly burned down the servants building. jushu says that he is the only one left in the family with any sense. they pass their father's quarters. it is being tidied with the door open, which allows shallan to see the far wall. she stumbles. though hidden behind a painting, she can see the outline of the strongbox glowing, blazing like fire. jushu asks what she is staring at, but when she tells him, he thinks she is crazy. shallan continues to stare at the light, thinking a monster hides there. that her mother's soul hides there. chapter 28: boots[edit] ""the betrayal of spren has brought us here. they gave their surges to human heirs, but not to those who know them most dear, before us. 'tis no surprise we turned away unto the gods we spent our days and to become their molding clay, they changed us."" tyn guides a chull wagon and gives friendly advice on being a con artist and impersonator to shallan. tyn explains how carefree she is and how fleeting personal belongings and missions are to her, and that her most recent mission ended without a positive resolution, though shallan senses some tension when tyn says this. the caravan encounters four uniformed horse riders, and tyn and shallan separate from the group to meet with them. tyn speaks with the riders, and proclaims shallan to be a horneater princess, and shallan attempts to play the role. one of the riders, kal, inquires if they have seen any bandits and tyn replies that they had and asks why he cares. kal replies that they represent the alethi king and want to patrol the area to clear it of bandits, and presses for more details on the attack. kal then comments that shallan looks too thin to be a horneater, and she acts offended and demands kal's boots in compensation, which he gives up reluctantly before their patrol departs. tyn compliments shallan on her impersonation but criticizes her for being overly empathetic as that is not a good quality in a con artist. chapter 29: rule of blood[edit] ""artform for colors beyond our ken; for its grand songs we yearn. we must attract creationspren; these songs suffice 'til we learn."" sadeas rests after a prolonged battle against the parshendi, reveling in the thrill before the feeling fades away and contemplating how it grows less sweet as he dwells on the pointlessness of the fights for gemhearts and the lack of progress toward his ultimate goals of conquest. amaram tells sadeas that his ploy of carelessness in going on the raid out of turn failed since the correct armies showed up before he left with the gemheart, but sadeas replies that he doesn't care. amaram expresses disapproval of sadeas and says he wants peace with elhokar and dalinar, but sadeas says that he knows how ruthless amaram really is. amaram acknowledges this, but says that there is a bigger picture to be concerned with. amaram asks if sadeas ever worries about the costs of war, and sadeas replies that a realistic viewpoint is necessary to achieve anything in life. hatham confronts sadeas, who concedes the gemheart and proclaims that he was bored, and then leaves to return to the warcamp. sadeas sits at the dueling arena, contemplating that his fashionable clothes are very uncomfortable and wishing that he could wear a simple uniform like dalinar's if that didn't send the wrong message. sadeas thinks about aging and desire to achieve a form of immortality through conquest. ialai shows up and praises sadeas' stratagem of giving away the gemheart to undermine dalinar's accusations of greed. sadeas says he is not pleased that eranniv accepted the duel despite his efforts to block adolin from having any dueling opponents, and that he wants dalinar's plan to fail so that he can rebuild their kingdom to his own specifications. as adolin duels with eranniv, ialai described the failed assassination attempt on elhokar, and they debate the ramifications of it, as sadeas ponders that elhokar must die and dalinar must be dealt with so that he can wipe the slate clean. sadeas and ialai decide to expose dalinar as a hypocrite since he didn't involve sadeas in the assassination investigation which would be only proper as sadeas is the highprince of information. sadeas says he will renounce his post in protest when it will cause the most harm to dalinar's strategy. sadeas realizes that adolin is toying with his opponent and that he is very skilled and clever to win while appearing to be losing. sadeas tells ialai to stop from interfering with adolin's dueling aspirations to try to take advantage of adolin's hotheadedness, and to invite ruthar on his next hunt. chapter 30: nature blushing[edit] ""'tis said it was warm in the land far away when voidbringers entered our songs. we brought them home to stay and then those homes became their own, it happened gradually. and years ahead 'twil still be said 'tis how it has to be."" shallan is excited to see a small naturally occurring diverse ecosystem of plants and small animals protected by a rock overhang, and has their caravan diverted to investigate it. shallan settles down to draw sketches of the small garden and is joined by gaz, who requests that she draw a sketch of him, to which she replies that she will. shallan draws a quick portrait with slight modifications from reality to make gaz appear more impressive and gaz is very appreciative. vathah tells shallan they are stopping for the night and pattern tells shallan there will be trouble, and shallan agrees. shallan draws a bunch of sketches of the thicket, then draws whatever floats into her mind, including a rocky ocean shore with some indistinct figures of which one reminds her of yalb and a woman taking a hammer and chisel to a statue, though shallan does not know why she drew the last picture. tyn tells shallan she has artistic talent but should practice forgery instead of drawing, and that she wants to introduce shallan to some friends in the shattered plains. she also claims shallan needs a dose of realism in order to be ready for the real life of a criminal. tyn asks if shallan wants to back out of their criminal enterprise, but shallan says she is committed and that her planned scam is to impersonate the betrothed of adolin kholin. tyn gives shallan some advice on carrying out her love scam. as they talk, shallan worries about the state of the betrothal even though it is secondary to her research on urithiru and the voidbringers, and about what to do with tyn when the fake scam falls through, though she is also excited as well. chapter 31: the stillness before[edit] ""smokeform for hiding and slipping 'tween men. a form of power--like surges of spren. do we dare to wear this form again? it spies. crafted of gods, this form we fear. by unmade touch its curse to bear, formed from shadow--and death is near. it lies."" kaladin, along with forty bridgemen from bridge seventeen, returns to bridge four's barracks for evening stew. pitt, one of those bridgemen, apologizes to kaladin for being glad when bridge four went on hunts instead of seventeen, and says he will do his best to motivate his crew. rock chases off a man trying to draw sketches of the bridgemen. kaladin eats his dinner quickly in anticipation of going to protect dalinar during the upcoming highstorm. tyn watches shallan practice sleight-of-hand tricks and inquires about her practice with accents and lectures her on how she needs to overcome her prudishness. their caravan reaches the outskirts of the war camps and they decide to stop for the day. tyn tells shallan the veden king is dead, along with six highprinces, all killed by szeth, and that she expected to learn more via spanreed later that evening. macob agrees with the decision to stop the caravan due to the upcoming highstorm that night. chapter 32: the one who hates[edit] ""the spren betrayed us, it's often felt. our minds are too close to their realm that gives us our forms, but more is then demanded by the smartest spren, we can't provide what the humans lend, though broth are we, their meat is men."" kaladin falls asleep during the highstorm and dreams he is the storm and speaks to the stormfather about syl. the stormfather says that kaladin will betray and kill syl and that he is already beginning to do so. as they speak, a second larger storm with red lightning appears and the stormfather says he is sorry, and tells kaladin that “he comes”. kaladin wakes up as adolin and renarin are discussing the upcoming meeting with the parshendi envoy. kaladin goes to the balcony to check on the weather but only sees the diminishing of the winds as the highstorm passes. pattern whimpers during the highstorm and ignores shallan as the highstorm passes over. syl tells kaladin something is wrong and that the one who hates is coming, and that something bad is going to happen. heeding syl's warning, he goes into dalinar's and navani's small room to tell them they need to take the king and leave the palace and head into the warcamp. kaladin explains that his instincts sense danger and dalinar agrees to trust his senses and leave the palace despite elhokar's dissent. kaladin sends beld and hobber to scout their way out and leaves moash and ralinor to guard their rear while mart and eth stay with the king. as they flee through the palace, they find a dark hallway where the spheres were drained of light and a hole cut into the palace through the rock wall. szeth appears, stormlight leaking from his body. dalinar orders renarin to take the king and flee. dalinar, adolin and kaladin stay to fight szeth, dalinar and kaladin armed with spears and adolin with his shardblade. the three rush szeth but he eludes them using a lashing, then binds adolin to the ceiling. kaladin and dalinar both stab szeth with their spears, but he chops the weapons in half with his blade and smacks down dalinar as he heals using stormlight. adolin falls to the ground when the lashing runs out, and he stays down. kaladin uses his spear like a quarterstaff and with syl flying around him attacks szeth, hitting him a few times and forcing him to draw in more stormlight. szeth is able to dodge a strike and stab kaladin through his arm with the shardblade, causing it to go numb and lifeless, and kaladin then is kicked into a wall, and slumps in frustration as szeth goes to chase down his prey. syl tells kaladin that szeth is not a radiant but something worse and pleads for kaladin to get up. dalinar confronts szeth and says he won't let the king die but szeth says he is there to kill dalinar instead. as szeth swings it from above his head at him for a killing blow, dalinar catches the shardblade between his palms, and kaladin arrives and knocks both himself and szeth through the hole in the wall into open air. chapter 33: burdens[edit] ""but it is not impossible to blend their surges to ours in the end. it has been promised and it can come. or do we understand the sum? we question not if they can have us then, but if we dare to have them again."" as szeth and kaladin plunge toward the ground, szeth starts glowing more brightly and kaladin uses szeth's gemstones to draw in some stormlight before he loses his grip on the assassin. kaladin lands hard but the stormlight quickly heals him, though his right arm is still grey and lifeless although he has some slight sense of feeling in his arm. szeth is shocked at kaladin's survival and thinks that he accidentally lashed kaladin to slow his fall. as szeth pauses in confusion, kaladin uses his stormlight to bring his right arm back to life, and szeth cries out in surprise. szeth jumps back in shock and asks what kaladin is and kaladin replies that he is a windrunner, the same as szeth. but szeth denies this, angrily shouting that he was named truthless, and asks if the radiants are all back. kaladin says yes and szeth flees. kaladin collapses in exhaustion. kaladin wakes up with syl hovering nearby and expresses surprise at his ability to heal the shardblade wound, which syl did not expect either. syl tells him there are dead at the battle scene and goes with kaladin back inside the palace. kaladin tracks down the king's entourage. dalinar is shocked at kaladin's survival and kaladin says that he held onto szeth as they fell and somehow lived due to szeth's abilities, which the others believe. kaladin wants to tell dalinar about his abilities but not adolin or elhokar so he says nothing. kaladin says that szeth escaped and that he saw a light in the darkness which earns a glance from syl though it wasn't a complete lie. elhokar says that szeth came for him and no one corrects him on his mistake. kaladin leaves to do something and tells the others to stay there. adolin ponders the strangeness of kaladin apparently healing from a shardblade wound and surviving a great fall but dismisses his suspicions as paranoia. elhokar goes to get more wine and they find a series of glyphs carved into the wood and renarin says that in thirty-eight days, it will be the end of all nations. kaladin finds beld's corpse and laments that he failed the bridgeman, but syl says that he died protecting and that was beld's choice. kaladin asks about how skilled the assassin was and if kaladin has more words to speak, but syl says that though there are more words, he is not ready yet to speak them. kaladin asks how the assassin could have found a spren to bond and yet still slaughter without honor and compares that to his killing of parshendi, and syl says the two situations are totally different since kaladin is protecting, and that szeth's shardblade is somehow different and that he uses the wrong amount of stormlight. kaladin finds hobber still alive, but with both legs disabled, and says he will stay with bridge four as a cook, and brings him back to get medical attention. chapter 34: blossoms and cake[edit] ""our gods were born splinters of a soul, of one who seeks to take control, destroys all lands that he beholds, with spite. they are his spren, his gift, his price. but the nightforms speak of future life, a challenged champion. a strife even he must requite."" shallan reads a dispatch on tyn's spanreed about the political situation in jah keved and dwells on the consequences for her family if there is a succession war. tyn asks if shallan personally knows any of the important players for the veden throne but shallan says she wasn't important enough. tyn says they might want to go to jah keved to take advantage of the chaos once they are done in the shattered plains. the spanreed report continues with information about the deserters and reward bounties from their former leader, sadeas. shallan is angered that tyn wants to turn them in and says that she promised them amnesty but tyn scoffs at this and says that a con artist can't afford to believe their own lies and that shallan has no chance to get sadeas to forgive the deserters. shallan is upset at this and worries that she will soon get caught up between the truth and tyn's misguided notions over who shallan really is. tyn continues reading the spanreed and gleefully announces that there is good news and shallan reads the printout about jasnah being dead and the wind's pleasure being lost with all hands. tyn confirms that this was her job to the south. the spanreed also mentions about jasnah taking a new ward, a girl named shallan. tyn reacts immediately, slamming shallan to the ground and asking if jasnah somehow survived. shallan says no. pattern distracts tyn briefly but it is not enough for shallan to break free. tyn draws her sword to kill shallan, but shallan uses stormlight to create an illusion to distract tyn long enough for her to summon her shardblade and kill her. vathah, gaz and the other deserters appear at the tent, saying they heard a voice telling them to help shallan, then heard shallan's screams and fought their way through tyn's soldiers to help shallan. vathah sees the shardblade and says that shallan could have killed all the bandits on her own. shallan tells them the voice they heard was her spren, tyn was an assassin, and they are to search tyn's tent for any documents for shallan to read. shallan watches as the spanreed continues to write that tyn's employers, who happen to be the ghostbloods, want to hire her for another job and inquires if she would like to have a meeting arranged in the warcamps. shallan realizes that the city the ghostbloods are investigating is urithiru, and replies yes. interludes[edit] interlude i-5: the rider of storms[edit] as a highstorm approaches the city of narak, thude reports to eshonai that they have a meeting in seven days with the alethi and that he didn't see either dalinar or the surgebinder when he arranged the meeting. eshonai attunes resolve and brings her captive spren into the highstorm to transform. eshonai stands in the storm, with a shield braced against a rock to protect her from the winds, to face the stormfather head on rather than sheltering in rocks. the wind blows her shield away leaving her exposed, though she is able to hold onto some rocks to keep from being blown away. the eye of the storm reaches her and the stormfather asks if this is really what she wants. the red spren breaks free from its crystal and shoots out red lightning. eshonai has a bad premonition and says no and tries to elude the spren, but it hits her in the chest shooting out red tendrils. the stormfather says that this was inevitable, he cannot protect eshonai, and he is sorry. eshonai begins to transform. interlude i-6: zahel[edit] zahel wakes up suddenly, as his life sense alerts him that someone is approaching. he opens the door, feeling the aftermath of the highstorm, as kaladin is about to knock. zahel comments on how bad kaladin looks, and kaladin explains that he just stopped an assassination attempt on elhokar a couple of hours previously. kaladin asks if zahel's offer to train him is still open and zahel says no and to come back and ask again at a more reasonable hour and to have a good attitude. zahel goes back to sleep missing the voice that he used to hear in his head years ago. interlude i-7: taln[edit] bordin speaks to elhokar and dalinar of his journey with wit to transport a seeming madman to the shattered plains, as the madman listens on and thinks of various torments that he has undergone. the madman identifies himself as talenel'elin, herald of war, and speaks of the desolations wiping out past knowledge and of the other heralds helping to prepare the world for the time of the return and desolation, though his audience can barely understand him since he is speaking inaudibly with a northern alethi accent. bordin says the madman just dropped his shardblade and that his eyes were always dark. bordin suggests sending the madman to the ardents to take care of him. the madman comments that the coming days will be difficult but humanity will survive, and that he must be brought to their leaders. dalinar says he has a use for the shardblade and needs bordin's assistance as well. the madman comments that he thinks he is late this time and asks himself how long had it been. interlude i-8: a form of power[edit] eshonai returns after the highstorm to narak to a large crowd who were curious about her transformation. eshonai feels energetic, and sees tiny red lightning bolts when she flexes her fist, and has lost her bulky warform in favor of small ridges in her skin. she is able to leap a chasm by crouching and throwing herself into the air, with less effort than warform required. thude confronts her, saying her eyes are red which is something referenced in the songs but eshonai cuts him off. venli approaches, and is told that with the stormform that she can move in the highstorm unimpeded and that she can feel a storm building beyond the rhythms, a highstorm that they can guide to use against their enemies. eshonai addresses the crowd, saying that she saw the betrayal in the storm rider's eyes, and that he intends to help humans against the parshendi, but that they can now fight back using this new form, and the crowd hums to awe in appreciation. eshonai glories in the praise but a voice inside her screams in horror. part three: deadly[edit] chapter 35: the multiplied strain of simultaneous infusion[edit] ""they also, when they had settled their rulings in the nature of each bond's placement, called the name of it the nahel bond, with regard to its effect upon the souls of those caught in its grip; in this description, each was related to the bonds that drive roshar itself, ten surges, named in turn and two for each order; in this light, it can be seen that each order would by necessity share one surge with each of its neighbors."" adolin paces about on a plateau, wearing his shardplate, dwelling on the assassination attempt the prior evening. adolin tries to practice throwing his shardblade but loses focus often since he did not get any sleep because he was guarding his father's quarters throughout the night. adolin thinks that his three bridgemen guards are useless, but reflects that kaladin was unusually effective in protecting dalinar, though he is also very unlikable and strange. adolin succeeds in throwing his shardblade, and returns to the warcamp with his bodyguards, and notices a procession of soulcasters that usually aren't seen during daytime. adolin converses with the main ardent soulcaster kadash and learns that their services are in high demand and that they have to increase their training and work shifts. adolin watches as a group of soulcasters working behind a silk screen for concealment use their fabrials in concert to create a stone windbreak. adolin questions kadash about the old radiants and kadash answers noncommittally at first until adolin expresses that he needs information urgently due to the fact that the assassin had radiant-like abilities and kadash then agrees to do research for adolin. navani stands on an observation platform in the engineering grounds and supervises an experiment to use a fabrial to cause a platform to be raised into the air. after extensive preparations and careful implementation, their attempt to cause a round wooden parapet to float in the air without support succeeds. adolin joins navani and they talk in private, with navani explaining in technical terms how she arranged fabrials in tandem to act like levers to produce the desired results. adolin realizes the military application for this, but navani says there are more practical applications than raising archers in a battlefield. adolin confronts navani over her relationship with dalinar and the awkward position that his father is in regarding violating social customs that he lectures other highprinces about following, but she scoffs at those traditions, and tells adolin that he is free of his betrothal for the time being due to jasnah's disappearance. adolin and navani leave for a meeting with dalinar and elhokar. chapter 36: a new woman[edit] ""and when they were spoken of by the common folk, the releasers claimed to be misjudged because of the dreadful nature of their power; and when they dealt with others, always were they firm in their claim that other epithets, notably ""dustbringers,"" often heard in the common speech, were unacceptable substitutions, in particular for their similarity to the word ""voidbringers."" they did also exercise anger in great prejudice regarding it, though to many who speak, there was little difference between these two assemblies."" pattern opens a lock on one of tyn's trunks for shallan and she examines the contents, finding clothing and spheres among other useful items. vathah reports to shallan that he has burned all the bodies of tyn and her guards, and she says that she will deal with the skeletons to avoid uncomfortable questions. macob sends a servant to retrieve a palanquin for shallan, then goes his own way. as shallan enters the warcamp, accompanied by vathah and his deserter guards, and her slaves, she frets over her betrothal and plans to continue jasnah's research. she learns that dalinar is in conference with elhokar, and orders her palanquin to be brought to the meeting. as she travels to the palace, she draws a sketch of herself confidently confronting dalinar to try to boost her own morale. at the palace, shallan enters with vathah and gaz as attendants. they reach the conference room at the top of the palace, and kaladin spots her, and asks her if adolin is betrothed to a horneater princess and she replies that she was trying to travel incognito. kaladin has gaz seized, and says that shallan is an impostor since adolin's real betrothed was lost at sea, but shallan gives a spanreed printout to kaladin to have navani authenticate her claims. shallan becomes upset at kaladin's lack of accommodation and they have a heated argument. kaladin stalks away angry, but shallan feels that the disturbance will lead to the desired result of her receiving an audience with dalinar. gaz mentions that kaladin was a slave in the lumberyards recently and is very dangerous. kaladin enters the chamber with the paper, and returns after a short time, summoning shallan to enter. chapter 37: a matter of perspective[edit] ""now, as each order was thus matched to the nature and temperament of the herald it named patron, there was none more archetypal of this than the stonewards, who followed after talenelat'elin, stonesinew, herald of war: they thought it a point of virtue to exemplify resolve, strength, and dependability. alas, they took less care for imprudent practice of their stubbornness, even in the face of proven error."" during a break two hours after the meeting started, adolin ponders on the lack of consensus on how to deal with the threat that szeth poses to the kingdom and how dangerous he is even with the number of shardbearers that are available to protect elhokar and dalinar, based on the reports of szeth's other attacks. adolin drinks some wine and taunts relis over his boasts about wanting to duel szeth to try to bait him into a duel. adolin then directly challenges relis but relis says that adolin has to rise in the rankings according to protocol before he can fight him. relis declines despite adolin offering to wager five shards against one, but elit accepts a duel for the same proceeds. relis is upset that elit accepted the duel and tries to taunt adolin to a violent comeback and possible voiding of the duel agreement but adolin restrains himself. sadeas taunts adolin more effectively, causing adolin to come near to punching him before he is restrained by amaram who counsels him to ignore sadeas. adolin tells amaram to abandon sadeas for dalinar but he refuses and says that he is able to keep the kingdom from falling apart further by bridging the gap between sadeas and dalinar. adolin's mind wanders as amaram speaks about how sadeas' and dalinar's goals are the same despite the different means they use, and he sees shallan and is drawn to her immediately. amaram comments on his flightiness and need to settle down and comments that the girl is probably from jah keved, and adolin realizes who she is and goes over to meet her, as she speaks with dalinar and navani about jasnah being lost at sea. chapter 38: the silent storm[edit] ""now, as the windrunners were thus engaged, arose the event which has hitherto been referenced: namely, that discovery of some wicked thing of eminence, though whether it be some rogueries among the radiants' adherents or of some external origin, avena would not suggest."" shallan offers her condolences on jasnah's loss to dalinar and navani, reflecting on her own grief but using her sketch to project strength and suppress her emotions, and dalinar thanks her. shallan mentions that she also brought some of jasnah's belongings and has information on jasnah's research, which navani scoffs at. shallan notices adolin looking at her and feels some attraction toward him. shallan gives a detailed account of the attack on the wind's pleasure at navani's demand, and navani berates shallan for saying she set the ship on fire despite jasnah's apparently already fatal wound but dalinar defends shallan's action and navani apologizes and leaves. shallan tells dalinar an abbreviated version of her journey via caravan from the frostlands to the warcamps and about being rescued by deserters to whom she pledged clemency in reward for their service, and dalinar promises pardons from the king for them. shallan then brings up the betrothal and adolin joins them, smiling. shallan and adolin flirt awkwardly and adolin offers to maintain the betrothal, but dalinar asks adolin to get some wine so he can talk privately with shallan. dalinar inquires about shallan's family and her interest in adolin, and she explains the situation as jasnah described it to her. dalinar allows the betrothal to stand temporarily based on jasnah's implied endorsement of shallan pending further developments, and offers her a position as a clerk. their discussion is abruptly interrupted by highprince sebarial who gets dalinar to return to the conference table to resume the meeting. shallan mentally notes the attendees of the meeting, realizing that there are three primary factions with elhokar and dalinar opposing sadeas, ruthar and aladar, and hatham leading a group of mediators, and sebarial as an outsider excluded from the factions. shallan dissects the meaning behind the arguments until she is drawn into the discussion. shallan says that she has little knowledge about the events in jah keved since she wasn't there at the time of the assassination and that she is there as jasnah's ward and has personal business, and aladar realizes she is adolin's betrothed. several highprinces want to get her own testimony about events in her home country but she doesn't want to be used, so she lies and says that she took a job to work for her supposed distant relative sebarial and he plays along with her ploy. shallan speaks privately with sebarial, saying that their arrangement will be mutually beneficial. dalinar disrupts the discussion and says that the war is failing and that they will change their strategy to either make peace with the parshendi or march in full force and wipe them out. hatham expresses disdain and sadeas insults dalinar, which upsets and provokes adolin momentarily. dalinar mentions the parshendi envoy who offered an olive branch right before the assassination attempt and wonders at the coincidence and if the parshendi are still controlling szeth as they claimed to have when gavilar was killed. dalinar outlines his plans to scout the plains and outfit a major expedition to the center of the plains and choose and train new shardbearers to use the armor and weapons that he thinks adolin will win through duels, then brings the meeting to a close. sebarial leaves and shallan says she will meet him, and goes to speak to elhokar personally about his sister. she then brings a writ of pardon to vathah, which amazes him, and tells him that they all have a place to stay. chapter 39: heterochromatic[edit] shallan's father is having a feast, trying to pretend that their family hasn't grown impoverished. the guests are brightlord tavinar and his wife and daughter. they don't seem like they want to be there, and conversation is terse and stunted. eventually, shallan's father calls for a toast and announces that he has found a new wife, malise gevelmar, who will be coming to the estate soon. the response is subdued, which makes him angry, but he gives celebratory gifts to his children anyway. the boys receive fine daggers, and shallan gets a silver necklace. the door to the feast hall slams open, and a man walks in. the man is redin, bastard son of highprince valam, and he has come to investigate rumors about shallan's mother's death. lin says that his wife was murdered by her lover, but redin says that others tell a different story. they speak alone for a while, and lin eventually slams his hand down on the table in anger. calmly, redin stands up and announces that any lighteyes of high birth can provide witness, and asks if any of the children will come with him to do so. balat grabs the sides of his chair as if to stand, but seeing lin's face stops and whispers that his father will kill him. shamespren stir among the children, then redin states that if any of them remember something they want to tell, they will find willing ears. after redin leaves, shallan's father shrinks down in his seat with his head in his hands. chapter 40: palona[edit] ""that they responded immediately and with great consternation is undeniable, as these were primary among those who would forswear and abandon their oaths. the term recreance was not then applied, but has since become a popular title by which this event is named."" sebarial and shallan return to his warcamp after the meeting. sebarial explains that he profits from manufacturing and farming and selling his goods to the other highprinces, greatly offsetting his fines for not participating in hunts. they arrive at sebarial's manor and shallan is introduced to palona, his mistress. palona helps shallan settle into her living quarters. chapter 41: scars[edit] ""this act of great villainy went beyond the impudence which had hitherto been ascribed to the orders; as the fighting was particularly intense at this time, many attributed this act to a sense of inherent betrayal; and after they withdrew, about two thousand made assault upon them, destroying much of the membership; but this was only nine of the ten, as one said they would not abandon their arms and flee, but instead entertained great subterfuge at the expense of the other nine."" kaladin gives orders for teft to train bridge seventeen in the chasms. there are thirty-seven days remaining before the mysterious glyph countdown reaches zero. syl asks kaladin what his goal is now that his bridgemen are relatively safe. kaladin says he wants to beat szeth but syl scoffs at kaladin's explanation that he is trying to protect dalinar. kaladin encounters sigzil who is speculating with rock and lopen about szeth's motivations and true employer as he was trained by his master to ask questions. kaladin tries to duplicate szeth's feat of walking on walls but fails. sigzil wishes he could see syl and she appears to him. kaladin asks both syl and sigzil about windrunners so he can be better prepared to battle szeth but neither is able to give any information. sigzil, rock and lopen discuss the attempt to make elhokar fall off his balcony but kaladin ignores them and suddenly has an insight and a vision of another world that allows him to walk on the wall of the chasm. kaladin tells syl that he protects dalinar so that he can know if dalinar lives up this reputation as being honorable, and syl says that honor lives in people and spren like her. kaladin says that if he trusts dalinar that he will share the knowledge of his abilities with him. kaladin says that he will kill amaram for his betrayal. kaladin falls from the chasm wall and lands in the chasm with stormlight aided strength. kaladin explains his theory about the shardbearer slicing the balcony after the highstorm. kaladin notices gouges from where a chasmfiend passed and is concerned that it will be dangerous to train here. kaladin and the others return to their barracks and find a tense dinner gathering. renarin asks to join bridge four to become a warrior like dalinar and adolin and to be glorified in the tranquiline halls. renarin eventually persuades kaladin to allow him to provisionally join bridge four as a new recruit, and shows a good attitude even when given menial tasks to do. moash expresses doubt but kaladin says that renarin is different from most lighteyes and could fit in with them. kaladin ponders how to confront moash over suspicion of him helping to assassinate elhokar. moash advises kaladin to try to get a duel against amaram to deliver his own justice. moash and a few bridgemen leave to go drinking and invite kaladin but he declines and stays to eat dinner. chapter 42: mere vapors[edit] ""but as for ishi'elin, his was the part most important at their inception; he readily understood the implications of surges being granted to men, and caused organization to be thrust upon them; as having too great power, he let it be known that he would destroy each and every one, unless they agreed to be bound by precepts and laws."" shallan wakes up in her new quarters in the evening. shallan and pattern converse and shallan teaches her spren some figures of speech. shallan opens her trunk and finds the spanreed blinking an alert light, and sets it up to receive messages. shallan reads tyn's old correspondence regarding jasnah, house davar and the ghostbloods. pattern points out a code that he detects in the messages. shallan frets that she will not be able to infiltrate the ghostbloods, but then uses her sketching ability and lightweaving to create an illusionary disguise for herself. shallan receives a message on the spanreed that indicates the ghostbloods want to meet with tyn that evening, but shallan says that she is not well and that she will send an apprentice in her (tyn's) place. the intermediary eventually replies that the ghostbloods will meet the apprentice and gives a map and time for the meeting. shallan wears tyn's clothing, bluth's hat, and a darkeyes disguise and leaves to go to the rendezvous. chapter 43: the ghostbloods[edit] ""and thus were the disturbances in the revv toparchy quieted, when, upon their ceasing to prosecute their civil dissensions, nalan'elin betook himself to finally accept the skybreakers who had named him their master, when initially he had spurned their advances and, in his own interests, refused to countenance that which he deemed a pursuit of vanity and annoyance; this was the last of the heralds to admit to such patronage."" shallan walks to the meeting using her map as a guide. shallan tells pattern to follow her and try to see if anyone tries to trail her and pattern reports that no one is tailing her. she reaches the destination which is a tenement building and is admitted by a horneater guard. the guard points her to a staircase leading down and she finds another room with a trapdoor and takes a ladder down further and ends up in a carpeted trophy room with several people. one of the people reminds her of hoid. the man points a blow gun past her and shoots a dart at a target behind her. the man questions tyn's story and shallan revises it, saying that tyn wants to work through an intermediary for now. the man praises shallan's boldness and tries to bribe shallan into revealing where tyn is hiding, but shallan declines, and calls his bluff of torturing her successfully. the man says he revised his plan to kill shallan and track down tyn, and that he is satisfied at tyn's partial success but unhappy that tyn didn't show up in person. five other people including a masked woman are present. shallan takes a moment to examine the shelves of mementos. the man, who identifies himself as mraize, says his next target is amaram. mraize says that tyn is to learn amaram's secrets from his manor and bring information the following week. shallan aka veil accepts the assignment and doesn't haggle over the payment and is dismissed. after shallan leaves the building, pattern warns her that the masked woman is tailing her. she draws a sketch and creates an illusionary wall to hide from her pursuer. shallan's disguise vanishes as her stormlight runs out and she ditches her coat and hat and returns to the manor, feeling excited over her adventure. shallan makes plans to investigate amaram and interact with adolin. chapter 44: one form of justice[edit] ""but as for the bondsmiths, they had members only three, which number was not uncommon for them; nor did they seek to increase this by great bounds, for during the times of madasa, only one of their order was in continual accompaniment of urithiru and its thrones. their spren was understood to be specific, and to persuade them to grow to the magnitude of the other orders was seen as seditious."" kaladin arrives at the lighteyes training grounds and asks zahel to train him and moash, teft and yake. zahel plays a game where he throws rocks into a circle and tells kaladin to do laps around the grounds, but then tells him to stay as it was only a test. zahel gives instruction to renarin, then brings one of the king's shardblades for the bridgemen to practice with. zahel tells them he got permission from dalinar and elhokar for them to learn sword stances to better counter szeth's attacks. zahel says there is nothing holy about the sword and that he is not a very good ardent. moash, teft and yake practice with the shardblade but kaladin declines since he has bad memories of friends being killed by them. kaladin tells zahel to swing the blade at him without a guard so that he can have practice facing one. syl thanks kaladin for not using the blade. as kaladin is dodging zahel's swings, he meets adolin who gives him a nod of respect. ivis takes zahel's place and trains the bridgemen on the ten shardblade stances. after the practice, kaladin gets some water and glances around the training grounds, and spots shallan. yake says she is good looking but kaladin retorts that she is lighteyed. teft says they should keep an eye on shallan as a possible assassin and kaladin agrees. kaladin goes to talk to shallan and adolin joins him, saying she is probably there to ogle him and that she can't stay as it would set a bad precedent. shallan goes to speak to nall and doesn't even notice adolin. shallan asks permission to sketch the shardplate and shardblades for the royal record and receives it from nall. adolin says he thinks shallan is there to watch him, but shallan says that adolin is egotistic for thinking that, and she tells kaladin she returned his boots slightly modified, and that she still wants to take a walk with adolin. shallan abruptly leaves them to watch renarin and zahel, and adolin grins and says that shallan is insufferable for ignoring him and he then walks away. kaladin rejoins moash and the others but watches adolin, renarin and shallan. moash says that elhokar had his family executed and explains how it happened and that another lighteyes was also involved. kaladin asks if moash cut the balcony railing and moash says they can't speak there since it is too open. moash doesn't deny it and kaladin grows agitated and threatens to turn moash in but is convinced not to as long as moash stops trying to kill the king. moash says others are involved and asks kaladin to meet them and he agrees to. syl says they should go to dalinar and that she senses danger but kaladin says that he wants to find out more first. kaladin practices with the shardblade and ignores laughter and frowns from some lighteyes, thinking he was actually worthy for defeating that shardbearer, and on how alethi society is hypocritical on its treatment of darkeyes. kaladin asks syl for advice on who is right to kill and who isn't and syl says it depends if he is killing to protect or not. kaladin asks to learn the lastclap maneuver, which dalinar used to catch szeth's shardblade, from zahel but he says it won't be useful to learn, and the swordmaster is happy that kaladin accepts his explanation. chapter 45: middlefest[edit] shallan and her family are attending the middlefest fair on her father's estates, which draws people from hamlets and villages all around. a thaylen merchant has a colorful show chicken, jeksonofnone, on display, and shallan thinks it bizarre. she follows her father to their box at the dueling arena, where they are soon approached by brightlord revilar. revilar tries to force her father into an unfavorable business deal, noting his popularity with highprince valam and house davar's declining status. eventually her father bows his head and they send shallan away. she is excited to see the fair unchaperoned but forces herself to do work first. after finding eylita tavinar, who gives her a note, she sets off to find brother balat. while searching she thinks of her mother and her mind goes blank. jix, one of her house's guards, eventually finds her and agrees to accompany her. balat is at the axehound fights in the gambling pavilion, watching intensely, fixated on the animals killing each other. shallan gives him the note, and he's surprised and excited by the meeting she's arranged. after he leaves, shallan sits on a rock, relieved to be out of the pavilion and happy she was able to help balat, even in a small way. when she returns to her father's box, he's in a meeting with a man she doesn't recognize. the man, dressed in black, seems startled when he sees shallan and almost drops his glass. malise tells her that the man claims to have brought word from her brother helaran. when asked what news the man brought, her father commands her not to speak helaran's name and declares him disinherited. shallan leaves and seeks out their carriage. wikim is within, depressed and despondent. he asks whether their father sent her, or whether she came on ""one of her new little missions of mercy"". he tells her that she can't fix their family, and that he won't be around to see their collapse because he'll be dead by then. feeling like a fool, she gives him the gift she had prepared, a set of math problems, then hastens away from the carriage fighting back tears. sitting on a rock and trying to compose herself, the messenger in black starts talking with her. the man, unbeknownst to shallan, is wit. he tells her that the message sent by helaran to her father is that he ""has eyes nearby, and is watching."" wit then asks her if spren talk to her, which causes her to think about ""twisted symbols the eye should not see"" and ""her mother's soul in a box"". she tells him that of course they don't and that she should be returning to her father. wit tells shallan that helaran was right, her father is destroying their family, but wrong about everything else. he points out that wikim is engrossed in the math problems that she had given him. he asks her to tell him the most beautiful thing she can imagine, and she describes a scene with her family happily living in together. as she talks, wit pulls out some spheres and wisps of stormlight hang in the air between them. when she notices, she draws back and the light fades. wit tells her that she will need to understand the nature of lies and see truth before she can expand upon it. chapter 46: patriots[edit] ""when simol was informed of the arrival of the edgedancers, a concealed consternation and terror, as is common in such cases, fell upon him; although they were not the most demanding of orders, their graceful, limber movements hid a deadliness that was, by this time, quite renowned; also, they were the most articulate and refined of the radiants."" kaladin reviews bridge seventeen and tells pitt how impressed he is, which is a lie but spoken to motivate. he then checks on bridge eighteen where there are problems with cohesion. kaladin gives them a motivational speech and decides to split them up if their morale doesn't improve. as kaladin goes to check on bridge nineteen, sylphrena chides him on working instead of eating dinner. she tells kaladin that she sees red spren sometimes and kaladin thinks there is a connection to the countdown which points to the weeping. kaladin relents and goes to his barracks for dinner stew. kaladin scoffs in disbelief that more of lopen's cousin's joined bridge four. kaladin finds shen and gives him a spear and tells him that he will be permitted to train and shen praises kaladin, and starts to tell him something else but is interrupted by moash, who tells kaladin to join them going out. as they walk through the warcamp, they hear rumors of war in jah keved and a new emperor in azir, and sigzil pays the crier for more information. moash picks a tavern called the ornery chull for them to visit, and peet concurs. the bridgemen order drinks and rock speaks of his homeland and how the horneaters ended up living in the mountains with the help of the gods. rock says the hot springs are not just regular water, but rather a connection to the gods and a place to view the place of the gods. rock tells the bridgemen that there are certain details that he cannot divulge since they are complicated, such as the reason why he can see spren, and also tells them to stop making incorrect assumptions about the story. rock says he met a god named lunu'anaki from the hot springs who cannot hurt people, and sigzil is startled by his physical description. the conversation turns to how sadeas has not been obeying the hunt rotations, causing people to talk in the warcamps. kaladin fantasizes about bringing sadeas down using his abilities. moash tells kaladin that the people he wants kal to meet have arrived, and the two leave to see them in a private dining room with four people inside and a couple of guards. a man named graves greets kaladin heartily, and kaladin recognizes danlan also. kaladin calls the so-called patriots out on their plans to kill elhokar, and graves defends their goal as protecting the kingdom from a terrible ruler and getting a replacement in dalinar. kaladin argues against their plans, but eventually says he will consider helping them, and leaves with moash. kaladin tells moash he wants nothing to do with the plot and that moash is just pursuing his grudge and not acting out of patriotism, and that moash is not to meet with them anymore. chapter 47: feminine wiles[edit] ""yet, were the orders not disheartened by so great a defeat, for the lightweavers provided spiritual sustenance; they were enticed by those glorious creations to venture on a second assault."" shallan and pattern discuss several maps of roshar that seem to contradict other maps over the actual historical location of urithiru. pattern reads the maps and partially deciphers the dawnchant language that had mystified scholars for a long time. shallan and pattern take a carriage to meet adolin, and shallan practices lightweaving while traveling. chapter 48: no more weakness[edit] shallan, balat and wikim are relaxing in the gardens when they hear a carriage arriving at their house. balat goes to see who it is, and wikim tells shallan that what she's been doing has been helping their family. he gives her a bag of dried blackbane that he's been carrying for over a year, indicating that he no longer wants to kill himself, then jogs off to the house. though unsettled by the blackbane, she returns to her drawing. a short time later she is interrupted by shouting. when she reaches the house, she finds three men standing before her father and jushu kneeling on the floor with his hands tied behind his back. lin says he won't pay jushu's gambling debts, despite his son's pleas, and tells the men that they can have him. shallan begs ballat to do something as jushu is dragged away, but he doesn't know what he can do. shallan follows her father into his study. the house's ledgers are open and she can see that they are in staggering debt. her father tells her that he doesn't have the spheres to pay the men, and commands her confined to her rooms. crying, she runs back into the feast hall, asks balat and wikim for the daggers their father had given them, then chases after jushu and the men. she manages to convince the men to take the daggers and her necklace (which they decide not to keep) in payment of jushu's debt, though they are only worth about half of it. she tells jushu, who's been beaten and can't hear well, that balat and wikim saved him. she returns to her rooms and waits, hearing the inevitable shouts. eventually her father opens the door to her room. she can see the crumpled form of minara, their serving maid, in the hall. her arm is broken and she leaves a streak of blood on the wall as she tries to crawl away. her father tells shallan that he's found a way to control himself, he just needs to let his anger out, and that his anger is created when people disobey him. he tells her that he would never hurt her, and so he wouldn't want to have to punish others because she defied him again. chapter 49: watching the world transform[edit] ""these lightweavers, by no coincidence, included many who pursued the arts; namely: writers, artists, musicians, painters, sculptors. considering the order's general temperament, the tales of their strange and varied mnemonic abilities may have been embellished."" shallan arrives at an open-air winehouse to meet adolin for lunch. shallan tries to focus on her purpose of allying with house kholin but is distracted by romantic considerations. shallan and adolin make small talk until shallan is alarmed when adolin says that a highstorm is expected soon and she considers how exposed their lunch table is. adolin explains that there is a new trend to stay outside during the approach of highstorms and wait until the last minute to seek shelter. shallan asks adolin to talk about his experiences with plateau runs to show interest in him but ends up derailing the conversation by asking an inappropriate question which ends up impressing adolin and making him more open. shallan then asks about the chasmfiends and draws some sketches of chrysalises from memory as adolin answers and points to one of the drawings to indicate what chasmfiends look like. shallan theorizes that the hunts are culling the chasmfiend population and that a study should be made to verify this, and that she would like to be involved in that, and that she wants to go on a hunt to gather first-hand information. adolin tells shallan about the upcoming summit with the parshendi and the political situation in the warcamps and dalinar's visions and plans. in turn, shallan confides in adolin about jasnah's research and about how the parshmen are related to the voidbringers and asks if the parshmen could be removed from the warcamps but adolin doesn't think that is possible. as the highstorm arrives, the winehouse area is vacated for the shelters, but shallan stays transfixed as she watches the storm approach, despite adolin's attempts to get her to go indoors. she has a sudden desire to sketch, but adolin drags her inside before the doors are closed. adolin says that he will try to get her permission to go on a hunt before they split up into separate rooms divided by gender. shallan feels satisfied at her progress despite her unorthodox methods and ignores jealous looks from women as she plans how to sneak into amaram's house. chapter 50: uncut gems[edit] ""and now, if there was an uncut gem among the radiants, it was the willshapers; for though enterprising, they were erratic, and invia wrote of them, ""capricious, frustrating, unreliable,"" as taking it for granted that others would agree; this may have been an intolerant view, as often invia expressed, for this order was said to be most varied, inconsistent in temperament save for a general love of adventure, novelty, or oddity."" adolin sits in the storm shelter listening to the highstorm. adolin chats with elit who vows to win their upcoming shard duel. sadeas sits next to adolin and makes him uncomfortable. sadeas flaunts some emeralds that he obtained from an unauthorized hunt, and taunts adolin about the bridgemen and his renouncing of his title of highprince of information. sadeas says he is trying to save their kingdom from elhokar and dalinar and that adolin will make a good highprince and adolin replies in anger, threatening sadeas, who then walks away. after the highstorm ends, adolin along with two bridgemen guards leaves the market, putting sadeas out of his mind to think about how much he likes shallan. adolin spends some time shopping for jewelry for shallan before returning to his complex. adolin finds some bridgemen outside dalinar's sitting room, and glyphs on the wall that say thirty-two days, seek the center. adolin calls for the area to be restricted and for navani to be summoned. dalinar determines the glyphs were inscribed with his knife and navani says that they were probably etched by dalinar himself. adolin says he is worried because dalinar is foretelling which is something of the voidbringers supposedly. they discuss the meaning and decide that they will follow the advice to seek the center of the shattered plains in thirty-two days during the weeping, which they think will be easier if their peace summit with the parshendi is successful. they cover up the glyphs and swear the guards to secrecy. adolin asks about the parshman bridgeman being armed and dalinar said he allowed it out of curiosity. chapter 51: heirs[edit] ""in short, if any presume kazilah to be innocent, you must look at the facts and deny them in their entirety; to say that the radiants were destitute of integrity for this execution of one their own, one who had obviously fraternized with the unwholesome elements, indicates the most slothful of reasoning; for the enemy's baleful influence demanded vigilance on all occasions, of war and of peace."" adolin joins a planning meeting with dalinar, navani, khal, teshav and kaladin to discuss tactics for the upcoming summit with the parshendi. adolin decides to attend the summit in dalinar's place to keep his father out of harm's way. adolin rides dalinar's ryshadium, gallant, to keep up pretenses, as he travels to the meeting with the parshendi. after adolin arrives at the designated plateau, the parshendi arrive as well. adolin and his scribe brightness inadara meet alone with eshonai. adolin says they are there to discuss terms of a parshendi surrender, but eshonai laughs and says things changed since she spoke with adolin previously. adolin senses a different demeanor to eshonai, who says there will be peace only when one of the sides is wiped out, and that she only appeared to see dalinar in person. adolin asks why they killed gavilar and she replies because he revealed his plans to return the parshendi gods, then she leaves. adolin returns to the warcamps with his entourage. adolin broods that he should have allowed dalinar to go instead, but dalinar replies that adolin did well and that now they can battle the parshendi with a clear conscience. dalinar reveals a battleplan to take as many soldiers and highprinces to the center of the shattered plains during the weeping to bring an end to the war. dalinar implores adolin to fight more duels and says he will try to convince neutral highprinces to join the expedition. chapter 52: into the sky[edit] ""now, as the truthwatchers were esoteric in nature, their order being formed entirely of those who never spoke or wrote of what they did, in this lies frustration for those who would see their exceeding secrecy from the outside; they were not naturally inclined to explanation; and in the case of corberon's disagreements, their silence was not a sign of an exceeding abundance of disdain, but rather an exceeding abundance of tact."" kaladin walks through the shattered plains at night to the plateau where he encountered wit a few weeks previously. kaladin verifies that no one can see him, and he steps off the plateau into a chasm. after landing at the bottom, he runs through the chasm, with sylphrena alongside him. he tries to jump onto a wall but fails and lands on the ground. sylphrena offers some advice, and kaladin agrees that he has to practice to be able to fight and lash as well as szeth. kaladin realizes he has to get over fear of injury and is able to jump on the wall without stumbling or falling, then back onto the floor. kaladin becomes more comfortable in jumping between the ground and walls and tells sylphrena that everything about himself changed to allow this. kaladin runs along the walls and leaps chasms and plateaus, draining all his gems and glowing with stormlight. sylphrena follows him along with dozens of windspren. kaladin lashes himself over the plateaus and hovers in place, noticing a pattern in the plains beneath him. as he stays in the same place, the windspren leave him. kaladin asks if sylphrena was with him as a child and she says yes and no. kaladin says that all his skill was due to her, but she says that it was due to both of them, which kaladin accepts. sylphrena says that szeth's weapon is special and was made to give abilities to men in the same way their bond does. kaladin asks if a new unstained blade can be forged and syl says yes but doesn't say how. syl confronts kaladin on informing dalinar about moash's patriot friends and kal replies that he wants to consider it some more first. he walks toward sadeas' camp and contemplates killing amaram for his role in tien's death, but syl gets him to reconsider in light of his accomplishments that evening. returning to his barracks, he finds shen there, who says that he has to leave immediately, and kaladin permits it, saying he is a free man. shen says his real name is rlain, and that he thinks kaladin is a good man. shallan walks through sadeas' warcamp disguised as a messenger boy. shallan enters amaram's manor after passing a checkpoint guarded by hav. shallan waits for a maid and a man to leave the manor grounds, then changes her clothing and disguise to impersonate her, and enters the manor. shallan enters the kitchen, trying to imitate the maid's mannerisms. the cook addresses her and gives her tasks to do, and shallan just nods without speaking so as to not blow her cover. shallan almost runs into amaram who she thought wasn't going to be in his home, and panics. she follows amaram toward the room she wants to enter, and confronts him, saying that a messenger is waiting outside to give him a message, and he leaves to investigate. shallan asks pattern to pick the lock and she enters the shuttered room which turns out to be filled with maps. shallan asks pattern to act as lookout while she peruses the maps and predictions for highstorms. she takes memories of the maps which focus on the shattered plains and are more detailed than any she had seen before. she also deciphers the handwritten stormwarden glyphs though she is puzzled by them as they aren't meant to form sentences, and realizes that amaram intends to find out from the parshendi how to return the voidbringers, and to reach the center of the shattered plains before dalinar's army. she theorizes that jasnah, the ghostbloods and amaram all are interested in the same things. she also realizes that she has to avoid alerting amaram that his private room was infiltrated. shallan returns to the kitchen disguised as amaram using pattern to imitate the brightlord's voice. she tells the cook that telesh was on a secret mission for amaram and that the cook is to pretend that she knows nothing of where telesh was that evening and to not mention this conversation to amaram at any point. shallan then leaves the manor and changes her guise back to that of the messenger boy and returns to the front of the building as hav and amaram walk up. she says she has a message from shallan davar to request a time to sketch his shardblade to which amaram acquiesces. amaram summons his shardblade and shallan realizes that it used to belong to her brother, helaran. shallan requests the background of the shardblade and amaram lies and says he got it from a young veden man who tried to assassinate him, and she thinks that amaram killed helaran. she then takes her leave, realizing that helaran was caught up in the conspiracy. chapter 53: perfection[edit] ""as to the other orders that were inferior in this visiting of the far realm of spren, the elsecallers were prodigiously benevolent, allowing others as auxiliary to their visits and interactions; though they did never relinquish their place as prime liaisons with the great ones of the spren; and the lightweavers and willshapers both also had an affinity to the same, though neither were the true masters of that realm."" adolin duels elit with precision, realizing that his previous tactics didn't persuade anyone into accepting his challenges. adolin wears down elit with small strikes to his armor, causing many small cracks until elit's armor eventually is drained of stormlight and he is unable to move. adolin shoves elit who falls to the ground, and is awarded judgment. adolin retires to his staging room where renarin and navani wait. shallan shows up to congratulate him. navani compliments shallan and leaves before shallan can say anything and adolin says to give her time to grieve. shallan says that she wants to have dinner and a walk with adolin the next day and says that her research says that if adolin wins his next bout in a spectacular fashion it could help him with his duels. relis ruthar storms into the staging area demanding the bout be nullified but highjudge istow refuses. adolin offers to wager six shards and fight relis alongside whoever relis chooses and relis accepts to duel in two days. shallan explains her plan to adolin. chapter 54: veil's lesson[edit] ""there came also sixteen of the order of windrunners, and with them a considerable number of squires, and finding in that place the skybreakers dividing the innocent from the guilty, there ensued a great debate."" shallan travels in her guise as veil to a meeting with the ghostbloods in the unclaimed hills, following a map sent via spanreed. mraize quizzes shallan on the uses of a parshendi blowgun and her answers make mraize realize she is a scholar. mraize asks shallan why tyn failed at her mission and is surprised to learn that she succeeded instead as shallan provides him with reproductions of the locked room and maps. shallan accidentally reveals her sketching ability then is forced to demonstrate it. mraize offers shallan a job and realizes that she killed tyn. mraize cautions shallan that the ghostbloods are protective of each other and have a greater purpose, and that she would be assigned another mission, and shallan leaves. when she is out of sight of the ghostbloods, she hides inside an illusionary rock. she tells pattern to imitate her to tell the carriage to return to the warcamps. as she hides, she hears mraize give instructions to someone to bring shallan's sketches to thaidakar. her illusion wears off after several hours and she walks back to the warcamps, on the way encountering her burned out carriage wrecked with all the parshmen and the driver killed, which upsets shallan greatly. shallan and pattern discuss uses of her lightweaving ability. chapter 55: the rule of the game[edit] ""the considerable abilities of the skybreakers for making such amounted to an almost divine skill, for which no specific surge or spren grants capacity, but however the order came to such an aptitude, the fact of it was real and acknowledged even by their rivals."" kaladin guards adolin as they get a carriage to bring them to sebarial's warcamp to meet shallan. kaladin recognizes wit as the carriage driver and is surprised. wit berates kaladin for abandoning his flute and mocks his lack of eloquent retorts to wit's insults. wit implies that he knows of kaladin's abilities and asks kaladin to tell him a story as they ride. when they stop to pick up shallan, adolin realizes wit is the driver and exclaims as such. shallan also exclaims upon seeing wit and hugs him, which surprises adolin. kaladin joins the two betrothed in the carriage to better watch shallan, and adolin and shallan flirt. they decide to go to see a menagerie. shallan reads an account of a highprince named yenev who was killed in a duel by sadeas by the right of challenge and king's boon because yenev opposed gavilar's unification campaign. shallan says that adolin can try to invoke this boon to challenge sadeas, if he wins his upcoming duel spectacularly. kaladin surmises that this boon could help him deal with amaram. kaladin decides that shallan is not a danger to adolin and that adolin is falling for her. they arrive at the menagerie and discover wit has already departed. syl admonishes kaladin for his sour mood as they walk through the menagerie. shallan draws sketches of the various animals and chats with adolin. syl asks kaladin if he is almost ready, and he replies yes. amaram and dalinar appear at the menagerie. amaram is wearing a distinctive cloak and dalinar announces that he is refounding the knights radiant and that amaram is their leader. chapter 56: whitespine uncaged[edit] ""twenty-three cohorts followed behind, that came from the contributions of the king of makabakam, for though the bond between man and spren was at times inexplicable, the ability for bonded spren to manifest in our world rather than their own grew stronger through the course of the oaths given."" kaladin and sigzil discuss amaram's lack of surgebinding ability as they arrive at the dueling arena. with the entire kholin household in attendance, kaladin brings every guard that he could. kaladin feels anger that amaram is honored by his appointment by dalinar after what kaladin told dalinar about amaram, and decides that he has to do something about it if dalinar won't. sigzil suggests that kaladin reveal his powers and join dalinar's knights but kaladin ignores this and sends sigzil to pass his orders to the guards. kaladin orders moash to lead a patrol duty the next day so that he is away when graves is dealt with. adolin speaks with his shardblade to prepare for his duel. he burns a glyphward painted by shallan and tells navani to give her a chance. they discuss the plan regarding the boon and some changes to the terms of the duel. they review adolin's preparations and adolin gets anxious when he realizes he doesn't have his mother's bracelet as a good luck charm. adolin enters the dueling arena and waves to shallan and checks to see if sadeas is there. his opponents enter the arena and he is shocked that there are four instead of two like he expected. dalinar questions sadeas about what is happening and sadeas proclaims ignorance, until elhokar questions him. sadeas replies that since adolin wasn't specific enough when naming the terms of the duel that he would be subject to a full disadvantaged duel. dalinar tells elhokar that adolin would have to forfeit but elhokar dissuades him, and the duel begins. adolin curses himself as he realizes his mistake in the way he issued and accepted the duel challenge. he realizes the four opponents include relis, elit, abrobadar and jakamav. adolin puts his back to a wall so he doesn't get surrounded, and zahel shouts advice to him to try to fight them one at a time. adolin takes an offensive approach and does well until jakamav is able to surprise him with a hammer blow. adolin tries to yield but in the chaos of the duel is ignored, and he realizes that he might be severely injured. dalinar realizes that adolin can have two fellow duelists under the terms of the challenge and asks for elhokar's shardblade but the king refuses, since that would endanger dalinar. sadeas taunts dalinar for not going into the arena to help adolin. dalinar watches alarmed as renarin - without shardplate - goes to help his brother. adolin battles on and tries to get some breathing room so that he can signal the judge to yield, but relis threatens to have renarin severely injured or killed if adolin doesn't keep fighting and accept punishment for what he did to elit. adolin reluctantly agrees, but berates his supposed friend jakamav. dalinar implores istow to end the fight, then says he will end it since she ignores him, but she replies that her authority supersedes him in the arena. renarin fights abrobadar, but he is hopelessly outclassed. abrodar seems content to only stop renarin reaching adolin, and does not fight to maim as the other three gang up on adolin, and one of adolin's shoulder segments breaks. dalinar addresses the crowd, asking for someone to aid his sons. he looks at amaram, who averts his eyes. kaladin then volunteers to aid them, telling dalinar to take care of his men if it goes poorly, then he jumps into the arena with his spear. chapter 57: to kill the wind[edit] ""malchin was stymied, for though he was inferior to none in the arts of war, he was not suitable for the lightweavers; he wished for his oaths to be elementary and straightforward, and yet their spren were liberal, as to our comprehension, in definitions pertaining to this matter; the process included speaking truths as an approach to a threshold of self-awareness that malchin could never attain."" shallan wonders why adolin doesn't surrender since he is outmatched, and berates herself for not seeing the loophole and failing her betrothed. she briefly considers jumping into the arena but discards that idea. she tells pattern to try to distract abrobadar to help out renarin. she watches as kaladin joins the fight. kaladin tells sylphrena that this better end differently than when he saved amaram, and sylphrena says that it will. relis ignores kaladin and pays the price as he gets stabbed in a crack in his armor. kaladin guards adolin's back and says that adolin will need to break their foes' shardplate for him. adolin says for kaladin to distract one foe and to watch out for renarin while he fights the other two and kaladin agrees. kaladin draws relis' attention while adolin fights elit and jakamav. relis fights kaladin for a short time but then goes back to fight adolin who is skillfully dueling his two foes, so kaladin uses a lashing-enhanced kick to knock relis down, breaking his own legs in the process, though he is able to heal them. kaladin sees that he cracked some of relis' shards. adolin's own armor is mostly cracked but he gets a strong blow at elit and cracks his chestplate, slowing elit greatly. kaladin sees abrobadar waving his blade at the ground and sylphrena exclaims about something mysterious and flies over toward renarin. kaladin uses his broken spear to strike elit in his exposed armor and forces him to yield. the remaining three opponents gather to battle adolin, leaving renarin alone to sit in the sand. kaladin demands elit's helm and is given it; he puts it on his hand as an armored glove, and arms himself with a knife to help adolin. kaladin tricks relis into backing away then he goes to help adolin. relis and jakamav both try to attack kaladin with sylphrena circling around him, and he dodges their shardblades or blocks them with the helm until he runs out of stormlight, realizing the helm drained it from him. kaladin is backed against a wall, but adolin appears and grapples jakamav to the ground. kaladin sees that abrobadar was just defeated. relis, the last man standing, rushes toward renarin and kaladin follows, yelling at renarin to yield but he only dismisses his blade and does nothing. relis raises his blade toward renarin but is reluctant to kill him; when kaladin draws close, relis turns to swing at kaladin. in desperation, kaladin successfully performs a lastclap, catching the blade. he hears a scream that sounds like sylphrena; relis too hears the scream and drops the blade, fleeing the arena and forfeiting the duel. jakamav yells at adolin to fight him as he is held down and kaladin walks up to him with his knife and places it by a crack in his armor and tells him to yield or else. jakamav yields and adolin is declared victor. adolin laughs joyously at the spoils he won and asks kaladin to help him remove his drained armor. elhokar announces how impressed he is by adolin and offers him a boon. kaladin notices sadeas trying to leave the arena, but before he does, adolin demands the right to duel sadeas. kaladin immediately demands to challenge amaram for the crimes of murder and obstruction of justice, causing amaram to cower. adolin groans and the crowd goes silent. elhokar orders kaladin to be arrested. chapter 58: never again[edit] ""so melishi retired to his tent, and resolved to destroy the voidbringers upon the next day, but that night did present a different stratagem, related to the unique abilities of the bondsmiths; and being hurried, he could make no specific account of his process; it was related to the very nature of the heralds and their divine duties, an attribute the bondsmiths alone could address."" kaladin, in chains, listens as dalinar argues on his behalf while elhokar berates kaladin for besmirching a general and destroying their chance to defeat sadeas immediately since sadeas uses a loophole to delay the duel. elhokar threatens to have kaladin executed for slander but dalinar says he won’t stand for it. elhokar then orders kaladin to be imprisoned until further notice which dalinar accepts. dalinar thanks kaladin for saving adolin and renarin but then berates him for ruining their plan to defeat sadeas and for his allegations which dalinar has found seventeen witnesses who testify in favor of amaram's statements. kaladin argues against his punishment but dalinar says that he will obey and serve his sentence. sadeas returns to his own quarters and contemplates his narrow escape. ialai appears and sadeas orders her to find incriminating information about dalinar then have him assassinated. kaladin is led to a prison cell in dalinar's camp prison. he tells sylphrena that he will never trust lighteyes again. interludes[edit] interlude i-9: lift[edit] lift and six other thieves climb over a wall of the bronze palace as they intend to rob it while a new prime aqasix is being chosen by the vizierate. lift sees nale in the distance and frets that he is still pursuing her somehow. the thieves climb up the palace wall and lift chats with her spren wyndle, who says that he wanted to choose someone else with whom to bond but ended up with lift since she had visited the old magic. lift and wyndle bicker as they infiltrate the palace. huqin says they are there to steal clothes which aren't well guarded but will sell for a lot. lift disobeys huqin and wanders the palace with gawx accompanying her. lift tells gawx that she wants to steal the prime's food and she heads towards the prime's chambers while he goes to the vizier quarters to find spheres. wyndle helps her further infiltrate the palace while he teaches lift about spren and her odd ability to convert food into stormlight. lift sneaks into the dining area and hides under the table as the vizierate reviews applications for emperor. lift listens as they debate what to do since no one wants to be prime due to the recent assassinations. she steals a dinner roll then hesitates as she notices that nale is there. she tries to flee but is caught, and nale has her arrested and tells the vizierate that he has the proper forms. she tries to use her ability to escape but is inhibited by a larkin which drains her stormlight. the head vizier protests that lift will be executed for mere thievery, but nale adds the crimes of trespass and interrupting a holy conclave in session. lift escapes long enough to get a half-eaten roll which she quickly eats before being captured again. after a short time, lift gains enough stormlight to evade her captors, though she sees nale has abilities also as he chases her carrying a shardblade. one of nale's companions slits gawx's throat, and nale recaptures lift, then berates his ally for killing the boy without filling out the correct paperwork. lift escapes but then decides to save gawx because someone has to care, and wyndle says that her regrowth ability could help if she was more trained. she returns to gawx' body and breathes stormlight into his mouth before nale again captures her and identifies her as an edgedancer and tells her about their order. nale says he hunts her because her abilities could bring desolations back to the world. nale draws his shardblade to kill her but she is suddenly pardoned by the new prime aqasix, gawx, who was elected due to his miracle survival. nale obeys the pardon to release lift and praises yaezir and leaves. lift congratulates gawx on his election and asks for food. interlude i-10: szeth[edit] szeth sits atop the tower of urithiru, haunted by the screams of his victims. he dwells on his oath and errant banishment for being wrong about the return of the radiants. he leaves the tower to seek answers - or someone to kill of his own choosing. interlude i-11: new rhythms[edit] eshonai tries to shoo away a spren but fails. she attunes her old rhythms as the new ones that she was listening to which had voices that gave advice tended to make other people nervous. she meets the others of the ruling council, with her sister venli having taken stormform as well. eshonai tells them that they need to transform more of their people to be ready for the alethi push toward narak, so they can summon a highstorm to use as a weapon. eshonai tunes out the voice within that is screaming and attunes joy and tells how awesome she feels. zuln dissents from eshonai's proposal, saying it is not right. the meeting breaks up and venli and eshonai discuss their options for getting consensus on their plan and venli says that she knew what the stormform would do to eshonai, angering her sister. eshonai asks how venli knew but she doesn't answer. eshonai addresses a crowd and tells them that the five want to forbid the new form but that she will allow anyone who wishes to join her in a highstorm to transform, then she generates a miniature storm for them to see as a demonstration of her new ability, impressing the onlookers. she then asks for volunteers from her soldiers for the new form and is happy that almost no one refuses her. she then tells the soldiers that she wants to transform all the civilians also, and has them go through the city get volunteers and segregate anyone who refuses the transformation. venli says that those unwilling to transform must be killed and eshonai says that will happen after her soldiers all take stormform. abronai refuses the transformation and is grouped with the dissenters, along with zuln. thude confronts eshonai on her changes in behavior and attitude but she defends her actions as necessary to their people's survival. eshonai sends thude to guard the dissenters, which include her own mother. as she prepares to speak to her entire people, varanis tells her that the dissenters escaped, helped by thude, but eshonai says not to pursue them since they will not survive the next highstorm anyway. venli confronts eshonai, who threatens to kill her sister but doesn't since she needs venli for the stormspren. eshonai lets venli go and addresses the listeners as she planned. part four: the approach[edit] chapter 59: fleet[edit] ""i'll address this letter to my ""old friend,"" as i have no idea what name you're using currently."" kaladin feels claustrophobic in his prison cell. kaladin asks sylphrena if she would help him break out if he wanted to and she says yes, but then inquires why he would break out since he entered there willingly. he hears a disturbance but isn't able to find out what causes it. he says he won't be executed and that he doesn't trust dalinar anymore because dalinar allowed his imprisonment and that he is the same as the other lighteyes. sylphrena asks him to repeat that and he is unable since he can't easily lie to his spren. kaladin speaks out against elhokar, saying the kingdom would be better off without him, and says that this is no different than when he was a slave, and sylphrena doesn't contradict him. wit appears, sitting on a bench outside his cell, tuning a musical instrument and mentioning his perfect pitch and saying that he came for the story that he previously requested at their last meeting. kaladin says he isn't in the mood but after some verbal sparring, wit starts playing his instrument which affects kaladin internally. wit asks kaladin to close his eyes and describe what he sees, and kaladin thinks of a race, and says as such, and wit sings lyrics that rhyme and repeat kaladin's story in musical form, accompanying with his instrument. as wit sings the story of fleet, kaladin pictures it in his mind, and each time wit pauses, kaladin tells fleet's tale for wit to expound upon. fleet races against a highstorm from the eastern sea to the lands of shinovar and reaches safety but dies due to his effort, causing the storm to stop, though fleet's soul then rises to win the race and ride the winds thereafter. wit tells kaladin about the nature of stories and accepts the ending that kaladin gave this tale and asks kaladin what the meaning of this story was. kaladin says that the storm caught fleet, and wit says the storm catches everyone and does it matter, and kaladin says he doesn't know. wit says that's good since kaladin now has something to ponder on. chapter 60: veil walks[edit] ""have you given up on the gemstone, now that it is dead? and do you no longer hide behind the name of your old master? i am told that in your current incarnation you've taken a name that references what you presume to be one of your virtues."" shallan and pattern study maps of the shattered plains and old natanatan as well as amaram's notations while trying to locate urithiru. pattern tells shallan that she must remember what she used to know about him and unlock her repressed memories so that she can gain her abilities. she practices with lightweaving but is unable to create sound using her illusion, though she figures out how to reduce her stormlight glow. she also figures out that she can invest pattern with stormlight so that he can maintain her illusions and even make them move. chapter 61: obedience[edit] shallan has become the perfect daughter. she keeps quiet now, particularly around her father, and spends most of her days in her rooms. her father had proven several times that he wouldn't hurt shallan if she angered him, but would beat others in her name. the only time she drops her mask now is with her brothers, making jokes to try to drive back the darkness in their home. she is also more involved in keeping house davar's accounts, and their fortunes seem to have improved. her father has shrewdly stopped being bullied by the other lighteyes and has started playing them off each other. new marble deposits have been discovered, which provide resources to keep up with his promises, bribes, and deals. shallan hopes this will improve her father's temperament, but it doesn't. lin and balat are arguing about who he will marry. balat wants to marry eylita tavinar, but his father thinks she's of too low a status. he wants balat to marry sudi valam, daughter of highprince valam, who is a widow in her fifties. their argument escalates and balat calls his father a murderer. in response, lin coldly orders one of his new guards to kill balat's new axehound pups. balat is outraged and tells his father that helaran is back, and that they had met only two days past. they lock eyes, then balat stalks out of the room. shallan finds balat in the kennel, where his new pod of axehound pups were dead in a pool of violet blood. she'd encouraged him to breed them and he'd been making progress with his demons over the years, rarely hurting anything larger than a cremling now. they discuss fleeing their house, and balat tells her he wants to go to live in vedenar with eylita. shallan says she can't go but will try to think of a way for them to escape, and returns to the house. while passing her father's door shallan overhears him talking to rin, one of the house's new guards. her father tells rin to find helaran, ambush him, and bring back his head. he offers helaran's shardblade as payment. malise, having also apparently overheard this, is shocked that her husband would order the murder of his own son. a violent, angry argument breaks out, and rin leaves. chapter 62: the one who killed promises[edit] ""this is, i suspect, a little like a skunk naming itself for its stench."" kaladin wakes up in his cell resigned to the monotony of solitude and darkness. he sees a strange spren that looks like taut wires. he talks to syl who is nearby but hidden and tells him about a cryptic, a revolting kind of spren who hid from syl before she could find it, though she realizes that the cryptic may be trying to bond another radiant and that kal may not be alone in the near future. dalinar shows up and kaladin salutes him by reflex. dalinar tells kaladin to pretend he is guarding the prison cell and that elhokar may relent soon and allow kal to be released once the pardon doesn't make the king seem too ambivalent. dalinar says that his men are being taken care of and that his reputation with dalinar is not harmed, but kaladin retorts that the king has a history of allowing people to rot in prison, and dalinar knows about the situation that kal is talking about and says he would prefer to not speak of the roshone affair, which shocks kaladin. kaladin asks for a further explanation and dalinar gives it reluctantly. dalinar says that he wanted to demote roshone but was overridden and ended up exiling him where he could do no harm, not knowing what happened later in hearthstone. kaladin says the mercy shown roshone is rarely granted to darkeyes, and dalinar replies that kaladin is in a special position and that he has to show extra loyalty. dalinar also explains that he trusts his instincts about kaladin as a man that can help inspire positive change in the kingdom, and that he wants kaladin to lead by example and not act erratically. after dalinar leaves, kaladin discusses the revelations with syl and blames his family's misfortunes on elhokar. kaladin concludes that moash is right and that the king must die. chapter 63: a burning world[edit] ""now, look what you've made me say. you've always been able to bring out the most extreme in me, old friend. and i do still name you a friend, for all that you weary me."" shallan and pattern hide in one of her illusions to watch a drop location secretly for anyone to try to leave instructions for her, while she chats with adolin via spanreed. shallan decides she must be irresistible to adolin to keep his interest. she asks pattern why mraize didn't send instructions via spanreed and realizes that the ghostbloods are trying to spy on her. she tells pattern to find the spy and he locates iyatil. adolin sends a message that shallan can join a scouting trip to the shattered plains as she requested, but she says she hopes to find a live chasmfiend for her research. she gives an excuse to adolin to end their spanreed conversation, then destroys her illusion, and creates a new one of veil attached to pattern and tells him to make it seem that veil is retrieving something from the tree, then to go to an adjacent alleyway. shallan waits outside iyatil's room, disguised as veil, and confronts her when iyatil enters the hallway, explaining how she was tricked by her ""double"". iyatil gives her name and explains that shallan has an urgent task to investigate a new arrival in dalinar's camp and that she is to watch while shallan performs it. shallan tells iyatil that she can join her instead of following her secretly. shallan and iyatil ride in a palanquin as shallan reads her instructions to investigate a supposed madman that dalinar and elhokar are interested in. iyatil reveals that mraize is her student, not her master, and that she wears a mask to reserve herself and allow her to adapt. shallan removes her disguise without letting iyatil notice by using the palinquin's curtains for concealment and is immediately recognized and permitted into dalinar's camp. she has pattern make a distraction so that she can withdraw into the palanquin and resume veil's appearance without iyatil noticing. iyatil tries to guess how shallan got them past the guards and shallan flashes an enigmatic smile. the palanquin proceeds to their destination, and shallan deceives an ardent into thinking that her sister needs medical attention for a psychological impairment, and they are admitted to the temple. while some ardents try to diagnose iyatil, shallan sneaks off and creates an illusion of one of the ardents to move freely around the temple. pattern locates the madman for her and picks the lock so that they can enter his dark cell. the man is whispering about the return of desolation and needing to prepare, and calls himself talenel'elin. she tells pattern that she doubts that the man is one of the heralds. taln repeats his words and shallan writes them down, since he doesn't answer her other questions. shallan tries to recreate her illusion, but taln sees this and grabs her and holds her against the wall in alarm, and speaks of one of ishar's knights, then goes back to his bed and lies down and repeats the same whispers. shallan summons her shardblade to defend herself but doesn't need it. her mind blanks out and she thinks of mother's soul, then she wakes up and pattern asks if she is crazy, and she replies yes. she goes to leave the room, but sees amaram approaching it. chapter 64: treasures[edit] ""yes, i'm disappointed. perpetually, as you put it."" kaladin sits in his cell, moping and feeling dejected. he tries to absorb stormlight from a sphere outside his cell, and has brief difficulty before he is able to soak it into his fingertips. sylphrena appears and says she is worried about kaladin growing dark. feeling slightly better, kaladin takes his meal as a puzzled guard swaps out the dun sphere. shallan panics, but thinks quickly and creates an illusion of darkness to conceal herself within the cell. amaram and bordin enter the cell and close the door. shallan feels muted anger at seeing helaran's killer though she realizes that her brother may have been killed in self-defense as a possible assassin. amaram looks at taln and proclaims that his and gavilar's plan has succeeded. bordin tells amaram that taln spoke of a cache of shardblades once to bordin and amaram asks bordin to take him to the location before someone else finds it, and the two depart. shallan feels like she is in over her head with the conspiracies, though pattern doesn't understand her analogy. shallan returns to say goodbye to iyatil after giving her the transcription of taln's ramblings and a brief description of amaram's visit. after verifying that iyatil can escape on her own, shallan apologizes to the ardents for getting lost in the temple and prepares to leave. iyatil says how impressed she is, and asks who shallan really is, and shallan replies that she is a seeker of truth. shallan then tells iyatil that she will send a full report to mraize. mraize indicates that shallan has proven herself and is safe from any danger from the other ghostbloods, and that shallan is to get a tattoo anywhere on her person to symbolize her loyalty to the ghostbloods and that she is now admitted as a member of their group. chapter 65: the one who deserves it[edit] shallan is in her room. not two hours have passed since her father ordered helaran's assassination, and a pair of guards have been stationed outside in the hallway. she suspects the guards are there to keep her stepmother from trying to flee, though she doesn't even know whether malise is still alive. she quietly slips from her room and walks toward the guards, hands trembling. she doesn't know them, all of the guards she'd grown up with have been replaced. one of the men puts his hand up to stop her, but she keeps walking, insisting that her father will need her. as she passes her father's door, she can hear malise softly weeping. shallan finds her father slumped at the high table in the feast hall, but slips into the kitchen before he notices her. she mixes his favorite drink; deep violet wine warmed and spiced with cinnamon. when she returns to the feast hall and gives it to him, she looks into his eyes. she doesn't see the darkness there, which is very rare these days. lin complains that no one listens to him, and that his house should support him. shallan tells him that she'll speak with them and goes outside into the night air. she finds balat laying on a bench in the gardens. he's been ripping the claws off of cremlings again. shallan tells him that their father can't control himself anymore, and that he ordered the assassination of helaran. they make a plan for balat and malise to escape with a letter from shallan to warn their brother. shallan then returns to the house and goes to her father's sitting room. the guards stop her, but she holds her ground despite her fear, and they eventually let her pass. this is the first time she's entered this room in years, and she has to raise a hand to shade her eyes against the light coming from behind the painting. it is blinding to her and she wonders how anyone can stand it. malise, curled up in a chair with her lip split and her arm broken, says that lin will kill them all. shallan starts treating the wounds, and tells her stepmother about the escape plan. as shallan is about to leave, malise asks her ""if i go, and balat with me, who will he hate? who will he hit? maybe you, finally? the one who actually deserves it?"" shallan just replies, ""maybe."" chapter 66: stormblessings[edit] ""is not the destruction we have wrought enough? the worlds you now tread bear the touch and design of adonalsium. our interference so far has brought nothing but pain."" kaladin mopes in his cell, imagining paranoid fantasies of his incompetence and of bridge four placating him by saying they like to be bodyguards. kaladin snaps to alertness as a jailer says he is pardoned with no loss of rank and free to go. kaladin vows that he will never be imprisoned again by anyone as he leaves. he figures he was there for several weeks based on his beard. they pass another cell where adolin is locked up, and he leaves his cell as well, and the jailer explains that adolin demanded to be locked up until kaladin was freed. adolin says that he did this because it wasn't right for kaladin to be locked up, since kaladin saved his life and that of his brother's. the two banter and reconcile, and adolin holds elhokar responsible for the failure of their plan. kaladin confirms that he was telling the truth when he accused amaram and adolin believes him despite dalinar's friendship with amaram. they enter another room where most of bridge four awaits kaladin to celebrate his liberation. adolin calls for quiet and says that after the other shards were distributed, there was a full set remaining which he gives to kaladin. kaladin gives them to moash, and adolin objects until kaladin explains his dislike of shardblades, and that he is more than capable on the battlefield even without shards as he showed in the arena, for when szeth returns, and that they would have an additional shard bearer for that confrontation in moash. adolin tells moash to take the shards and that he will now be a lighteyes and can start his own house or join one of dalinar's. moash takes up the shardblade, amassing gloryspren, and has the armorers put the armor on him. bridge four then returns to their barracks to eat some stew that has been simmering the entire time that kaladin was locked up. teft brings kaladin up to speed on bridge four's activities and emotions while he was away. kaladin talks privately with moash and says he agrees with the plan to remove elhokar, and moash is pleased and that they will possibly deal with amaram next. moash decides to go to the sparring grounds to practice, and kaladin returns to the barracks to feast. chapter 67: spit and bile[edit] ""my path has been chosen very deliberately. yes, i agree with everything you have said about rayse, including the severe danger he presents."" dalinar and navani watch two armies return from a hunt, and one of their guards leaves to get a status report. dalinar thinks how disciplined bridge four is, and how kaladin fit the ideal of the type of officer that dalinar looked for. navani talks about possible usages for fabrials and how gemstones weren't always used to bond shardblades, a fact which alters their understanding of shardblades. as she talks, he thinks about his more urgent preparations for their expedition to the shattered plains. she notices his distracted state and comments on it, then expresses her ongoing grief for the loss of jasnah and dalinar comforts her. navani asks how dalinar coped when shshshsh died, but he doesn't answer, though he thinks how he couldn't remember his wife anymore due to a hole in his memories. dalinar mentions the secrets hidden by gavilar and navani says she will try to find something in her journals about that, though she has already checked many times. dalinar says their immediate concern is the feast they are attending, and navani admonishes him to try to be encouraging instead of contemptful of the other highprinces, before they separate to the gender segregated islands of the feast. dalinar goes to the king's island, noticing that people seem to be paying more attention to him as he walks by. dalinar steps up to vamah and inquires about his hunt strategy, but vamah's response is interrupted by several people laughing nearby, and dalinar leaves to investigate, ending up face to face with aladar and sadeas. dalinar confronts them but they feign ignorance and walk away. dalinar looks around for someone else to question, then hears wit welcome amaram to the feast with insults, though amaram responds in a friendly manner. dalinar asks amaram about some papers being distributed, but is constantly interrupted by wit's remarks until dalinar and amaram walk away from him. amaram tells dalinar that the papers have accounts of dalinar's visions as dictated to navani. dalinar tells amaram to bring navani to him but she is already heading to him. dalinar asks amaram's opinion and he replies that he thinks the visions are authentic and meaningful for their roles as recreators of the radiants. dalinar asks about taln, and amaram replies that he is still investigating. amaram also comments on his lack of faith in kaladin's ability to protect dalinar and that he would like an apology from him. navani brings some of the papers, and tells dalinar that the words and tone were changed to make it seem that navani was humoring dalinar by transcribing the visions, and that a mocking commentary was added. dalinar asks if the visions were changed and navani replies that they were not, and dalinar says he will not be bothered by this attempt to embarrass him, and he quotes from the way of kings to shield himself from ridicule. dalinar stands on a table to address the crowd and says that the accounts of the visions are accurate, despite the mocking tone and commentary, and that in the future he will have the accounts of his visions published for scholars to investigate. he vows that he will be vindicated instead of broken and says that he will talk to each of them individually and ask them to speak their minds to his face instead of anonymously. dalinar sits down to rest after hours of politicking and talking up his expedition to the shattered plains. wit approaches and compliments dalinar on his approach to dealing with the insults. wit implies that dalinar outshines elhokar in importance, and dalinar asks if he is a tyrant, and wit replies that he is but that he is a benevolent one, which is preferable to a weak ruler, and what the world needs currently. wit said that what was done to unify the kingdom years ago was good work, but dalinar complains about how weak the kingdom is because of the means they used in unification, and that more than beneficial tyranny is needed according to nohadon. wit cryptically comments that he has to go somewhere but he doesn't know why, and when asked, denies that he is a radiant or herald, and that their goals do not completely align and that wit would watch the world crumble and burn to get what he needs, though not happily, and that dalinar can't trust wit. wit says that he will try to help carefully but must avoid being destroyed by dalinar's enemy, the father of hatred. chapter 68: bridges[edit] ""however, it seems to me that all things have been set up for a purpose, and if we--as infants--stumble through the workshop, we risk exacerbating, not preventing, a problem."" kaladin is on a scouting expedition to the shattered plains and has bad memories of being a bridgeman. he frets that he is unable to absorb stormlight unless sylphrena is near him, and she admonishes him for being naughty and acts capriciously toward him. he grows angry that syl doesn't agree with his decision and says he is broken, to which she replies that all the old knights were. kaladin decides to ignore her and enjoy the company of bridge four as they reach a plateau with a permanent scouting location. he overhears a scout tell dalinar that a glowing flying man was spotted in the plains, and dalinar believes that this was szeth, though it was actually kaladin. dalinar and kaladin discuss how renarin is fitting in with bridge four and if that is affecting him positively or not. kaladin has more difficulty absorbing stormlight, finds sylphrena later, almost acting like a windspren, and she tells kaladin to decide what he wants, and he realizes he made two conflicting promises to moash and dalinar which violates the code of honor. he asks for advice and sylphrena tells him to find the words, and then she flies away. shallan draws a sketch of one of the mechanical bridges being unfolded, and kaladin also watches, and recognizes one of the carpenters. moash shows up in his shards and salutes kaladin, though he now outranks him, and says he will always be part of bridge four, even as a lighteyes. moash says that the assassination plot is close to fruition, and that they only need kaladin to create an opening, which makes him worry over what sylphrena told him. adolin and kaladin discuss contingencies for a possible attack by szeth, and adolin asks for advice about women. adolin tries to get kaladin to reveal his abilities but fails. shallan joins them and starts sketching some moss, and they banter a bit, with shallan getting upset that kaladin insulted adolin and that kal acts so negatively despite adolin's positive attitude. kaladin rejoins bridge four to carry their mobile bridge over the mechanical one, toward their destination where a chasmfiend was slain, and where shallan plans to study the chrysalis. they reach the destination, and the carpenter that kaladin recognized calls to dalinar who crosses the bridge. kaladin realizes the carpenter worked in sadeas' lumberyard and cries out a warning. he gets adolin and dalinar off the bridge but is too late as the carpenter throws an emergency lever that causes the bridge to collapse with kaladin and shallan still on it. chapter 69: nothing[edit] ""rayse is captive. he cannot leave the system he now inhabits. his destructive potential is, therefore, inhibited."" kaladin kaladin falls into the chasm and is able to absorb a bit of stormlight through desperate effort though he hears a pained scream from sylphrena as he does so, and hits the ground, falling unconscious. he awakes in darkness, since all his spheres were drained, and great pain, and hears a voice asking what has he done. syl's scream haunts him. he is uninjured and gets to his feet, and runs into shallan, and lies about how he survived, and shallan explains how the bridge was collapsed. they search the bridge wreckage and find several bodies but don't see dalinar or adolin. kaladin thinks that he somehow saved shallan. kaladin says that there was a parshendi attack right before the bridge fell, and that means that dalinar probably retreated. kaladin tells shallan that they may have been rescued by a windspren as in folktales. kaladin and shallan discuss how they will survive and what dangers they may face, the worst of which is a highstorm due the following night. they decide to set out immediately for the warcamps. shallan shallan is both annoyed and pleased to find kaladin survived, and thinks that she saved both of them somehow. as they walk, she notices how much plantlife there is in the chasm. kaladin walks silently and asks if shallan will constantly chat as they travel and ignores her response, focusing on finding the shortest path back to the warcamps. shallan tries to get kaladin to relax but he reveals his prejudice against lighteyes and she says he only uses that as an excuse to be obnoxious. he brings up the incident with the boots, but then reveals that he doesn't have a grudge and that he doesn't actually dislike her as he does other lighteyes. shallan is insulted and they start an argument that is cut off as they hear a loud scraping noise that seems to be approaching them. they realize the danger they are in, and begin to run. chapter 70: from a nightmare[edit] ""whether this was tanavast's design or not, millennia have passed without rayse taking the life of another of the sixteen. while i mourn for the great suffering rayse has caused, i do not believe we could hope for a better outcome than this."" kaladin kaladin and shallan flee as they are chased by a chasmfiend. shallan chooses a path and orders kaladin to follow her. they stop and kaladin covers his stormlight, and he realizes that she lured the chasmfiend back to their original location to the fresh corpses for food. shallan decides she wants to see the chasmfiend, and get close to take a look at it as it fills the chasm and has small glowing spren around it like the spren that follow skyeels. they leave before the chasmfiend finishes its meal. shallan shallan lets kaladin lead, though she tries to keep track of where she is, and dwells on the chasmfiend. she grows tired now that all her stormlight is drained. kaladin says they should stop so they don't risk getting lost and going the wrong direction, and wants to wait until daybreak to get their bearings. they banter for a bit, with less antagonism, and shallan sketches their path through the chasms in the form of a map, which impresses kaladin. shallan kaladin wakes her up after a short sleep, before daybreak. they set out, and when the sun rises, they think they are going the right direction. they banter further, with shallan dishing out lighthearted insults while kaladin resists replying in kind unlike his earlier behavior. kaladin asks why shallan came to the shattered plains and she becomes serious, replying that she was trying to continue jasnah's important research, and that adolin was an added bonus. kaladin asks if she was there to investigate the strange structures that they saw and she tries to dissemble but he sees through it, and explains his original suspicions of her. she says that she wants the parshmen exiled before they betray the alethi, and he replies that they might be replaced with regular alethi slaves and she empathizes with his former plight as a slave. shallan tries to be lighthearted but kaladin will have none of it, though he tries to not argue either. kaladin explains that he thinks she is a typical pampered sheltered lighteyes which shallan rephrases back as self-contradictory and convoluted, and kaladin sees the flaws in his argument. shallan tells kaladin that she won't harm the kholins and she is sincere in trying to prevent disaster, and he accepts this. kaladin then checks their bearings and realize they are going the wrong direction. chapter 71: vigil[edit] ""he bears the weight of god's own divine hatred, separated from the virtues that gave it context. he is what we made him to be, old friend. and that is what he, unfortunately, wished to become."" teft teft and sigzil are in the warcamp, sitting vigil for kaladin, and teft speaks of his childhood and of what his parents did as envisagers. they knew things about the radiants, and some envisagers including his parents attempted suicidal stunts to see if they would manifest powers, and teft ended up turning them into the authorities who had them executed. dalinar shows up and inquires about their vigil and teft proclaims that kaladin definitely survived despite falling into the chasm. sigzil proclaims his belief in kaladin's return and dalinar just tells them to not overextend themselves or stay out during highstorms, though the highprince believes that kaladin is dead. kaladin kaladin feels like a fool for leading them in the wrong direction. he calls out for syl but gets no answer. he also feels like a fool for the way he treats shallan and for the incorrect assumptions he made about her. he compliments shallan on her drawing ability as she sketches a more accurate map of the plains, though it is getting much sooner until the next highstorm. she traces a couple of the plateaus nearby by walking around them, and kaladin notices her having a mysterious conversation with someone and speculates that she might be a radiant talking to a spren. shallan says that some of the series of plateaus are mirror images of others and kaladin says that the plains are symmetrical and that he knew that from a dream, and shallan says she knows where the parshendi are, and the oathgate, and that she can map all of it since the plains were not a natural forming pattern, but rather created through cymatics. they follow a revised path based on shallan's map, though they have to periodically check their route, slowing down their escape. kaladin occasionally shouts up from the chasm to try to get the attention of alethi scouts, but no one answers. kaladin grows moody because he feels that he failed them, but shallan tries to remain optimistic. kaladin says he wished he could be like shallan, but then shallan describes how it is like to be depressed and hopeless and he understands that she wasn't always happy, but she somehow muddles through anyway, which inspires him. they banter again with shallan trying to improve kaladin's mood again like she used to do with her brothers, and he goes along with their jokes to an extent. the chasmfiend shows up again, and they try to flee, hiding in a narrow fissure. the chasmfiend fails to reach them, but it then settles nearby to wait as the highstorm is rapidly approaching, with about two hours left before it reaches them. kaladin decides to try to distract the chasmfiend to allow shallan to escape back to the warcamps with her vital information. he prepares to fight to the death, and tells shallan to apologize to adolin on his behalf. shallan says that before he goes to fight to take her shardblade. chapter 72: selfish reasons[edit] ""i suspect that he is more a force than an individual now, despite your insistence to the contrary. that force is contained, and an equilibrium reached."" kaladin kaladin asks how shallan has a shardblade and she replies that it is unimportant. he brushes against the blade and doesn't hear screams like he did previously in the dueling arena. he reluctantly accepts the blade and shallan swears him to secrecy, then says she wants to get her satchel. kaladin distracts the fiend, dodging around it and leading it away from shallan. he uses the confined space of the chasm to advantage, and cuts the beast a couple of times, but then gets bitten in the leg as he tries to evade an attack. shallan distracts the beast and he is able to retrieve the shardblade but then collapses from pain. he picks up a sphere and tries to drain its stormlight but only hears distant weeping. he sees an illusion of himself that distracts the beast momentarily before it vanishes in a puff of stormlight which he somehow thinks that he created. he decides he has to go for the beast's head and stabs at it as its jaws reach for him. shallan shallan sees the beast fall on top of kaladin, and notices some spren around the chasmfiend seeming to leave it. kaladin's body protrudes from the creature's mouth and she tries to pull him out, and he says ow. they banter as she uses her blade to try to cut him free, and he explains that he stabbed the chasmfiend in the brain to kill it. once free, kal asks her to bind his leg for him which she does. they take a brief rest, and despair that the storm will get them anyway. kaladin then realizes that shallan could use the shardblade to cut out a cubbyhole above the waterline in the chasm for them to hide in from the storm and flood waters. she climbs up the dead fiend, then changes her blade to be knife-size and carves handholds in the chasm to climb above the waterline to carve a shelter out for them. they banter as shallan cuts the rock, and it takes about an hour for her to finish. she uses a vine to help kaladin climb up to the safe spot just before the floods reach them. chapter 73: a thousand scurrying creatures[edit] shallan and jushu are in balat's room helping him prepare to leave. they talk about the valuable deposits of stone recently found on their land, and how they find it strange to be wealthy all of a sudden. despite the family's wealth, their father's mood has continued to grow darker. shallan unfolds and reads a letter. their contacts haven't been able to find helaran, who seems to have disappeared. balat is jumpy, worried that their father will discover that he intends to leave. his plan is to escape with eylita, and if he can't find helaran, they'll go to highprince valam and redin, who years ago told them he'd listen to anyone willing to testify against their father. jushu is skeptical, saying that their father is in favor now, and that the highprince is nearly dead. wikim slams the door open, telling them that eylita is in the feast hall, that their father had summoned her. balat and wikim rush to find out what is happening. shallan follows slowly, overwhelmed with panic, but she feels pulled forward. somehow she knows that this has been coming, that it was inevitable. she collects the pouch of blackbane that wikim had given her years ago, and heads downstairs. balat is arguing with their father about eylita. lin reveals that he knows about their plan to leave. shallan enters the room and walks along the walls toward the kitchens. she notices something on the floor, blocking the kitchen doors from closing. lin tells them that helaran is dead; he died on a battlefield in alethkar. shallan reaches the bundle on the floor and realizes it's a body. it is malise; she'd been killed by several blows to the head. shallan concludes that he'd discovered the plan, sent for eylita and waited for her to arrive, and then killed his wife. it was a calculated punishment, not committed in a moment of passion. she moves to where servants had left a pitcher of wine with cups. balat unsheathes his sword, followed by lin. they clash brutally, and lin is able to swat balat's sword out of his hand. lin tells them that he's always despised balat, and of his sons only helaran wasn't worthless. shallan hands him a cup of wine, which he gulps down. balat grabs his sword and tries to stab their father, but hits something metallic through his coat, which stops the blade. lin tosses his sword aside and gets an iron poker from the fireplace. he slams it into balat's leg over and over, berating him about being useless. lin's hands start shaking and the poker slips to the ground. lin is surprised, and he stumbles and falls to his knees, then to his side. shallan, feeling cold, tells eylita to bind balat's wounds, then kneels next to her father. lin is motionless, staring at the ceiling. after her brothers' initial confusion, shallan tells them that she poisoned their father by placing the blackbane in his wine. jushu pulls a soulcaster out of lin's pocket, which had apparently been broken while blocking balat's last strike. just then, their father starts twitching, and his eyes focus on shallan. she realizes that the poison has only paralyzed him, and says that they need to finish the job. everyone else shies away, so she thanks her father for everything he did for her, then wraps her necklace around his neck. she twists the necklace around the handle of a fork for leverage, crying and whispering the lullaby that he'd sung to comfort shallan in her childhood as he dies. chapter 74: striding the storm[edit] ""you, however, have never been a force for equilibrium. you tow chaos behind you like a corpse dragged by one leg through the snow. please, hearken to my plea. leave that place and join me in my oath of nonintervention."" kaladin reaches the sheltered alcove just before the floodwaters arrive. he and shallan huddle together against the rock as the waters quickly rise, momentarily cresting over the edge of their carved out cubby. kaladin tells shallan how he was left to die in a highstorm by sadeas. kal looks up and thinks he sees a giant glowing figure followed by another figure walking in the storm. shallan asks kal to tell his story as a means of taking her mind off the highstorm, and he starts from when he was made a slave by amaram, and speaks of his slavery and tvlakv, his time with bridge four, and the rescue of dalinar and fighting the parshendi shardbearer. he hears chanting and sees strange spren flying around. after he finishes his story, shallan says she killed her father, and tells about how her mother died, and what her life was like when she was a child, and kaladin realizes how much he had in comparison with her since his parents weren't abusive. he realizes that her brother was the shardbearer he killed when he saved amaram, but doesn't reveal that fact to her. she tells of her plan to steal the soulcaster from jasnah, and instead becoming her ward and adolin's betrothed. she vanishes, and kaladin realizes that he is having a vision. kaladin sees a giant face and addresses it as stormfather, and is called child of honor in return. kal asks if shallan is a radiant and gets a rumble in return. kal asks about sylphrena and the stormfather says that kaladin killed her and that she can't be brought back since she is now broken. he also declares that kal will never ride his winds again, and then says goodbye as the vision ends. shallan exclaims and says she also saw the face of the vision, which kal identifies as the stormfather. after the storm subsides, they fall asleep. chapter 75: true glory[edit] ""the cosmere itself may depend upon our restraint."" dalinar amaram implores dalinar to speak with sadeas and make peace with him before they begin their expedition. dalinar looks at navani but doesn't reply. they hear horns which announce the sighting of a chrysalis and its location, and dalinar says they won't go after it on the way to the parshendi camp. amaram says that sadeas will go after it on his own, and that his disobedience is causing the rifts in the kingdom to grow worse. amaram says the voidbringers are coming and they need to be united but dalinar says the time and opportunity to work together with sadeas has long past. amaram tries to dissuade dalinar from his expedition and says that even dalinar won't listen to him anymore and why should anyone else, and dalinar replies that he has to go out to seek the answers. dalinar asks about amaram's investigation into the madman, and amaram says the madman was deluded about having a shardblade. a messenger runs up, saying that stormblessed has returned from the chasms. dalinar runs the entire way to the triage area where kaladin is receiving medical attention, and kaladin stands with great effort to salute him despite being told not to. dalinar asks how he survived, and kaladin says he is unsure but that spren were involved. kaladin also indicates that he has brought shallan safely back, and that he also killed a chasmfiend that had been prowling nearby, and presents its large glowing green gemheart to dalinar. shallan contradicts him and says the chasmfiend was already dead and rotting before they harvested it, and kaladin confirms this story, but dalinar suspects they are both lying. navani appears and becomes protective of shallan after her ordeal. kaladin implores dalinar to speak with shallan of her discoveries before dalinar leaves for his expedition. dalinar tells kaladin that bridge four held a vigil for him, with the confidence that he would return, and he asks if kaladin has been the person that he was searching for. kaladin replies that he once was but no longer is, and dalinar grunts in response, and orders that any demands of kaladin's are to be met as he is a hero, yet again. dalinar wonders where amaram went and decides to speak with shallan. shallan shallan rests in bed, accepting of navani's unexpected affection. pattern repeats a conversation that he was sent to spy on between dalinar and navani. notably, dalinar wants shallan to go on the expedition but navani trying to protect shallan by having her stay behind. shallan tells pattern she has to go and asks if she is a radiant, and he replies most likely not yet since she has more to do first, but he isn't sure since he hasn't always been sentient. pattern tells of the recreance, when most spren except the stormfather and a few others were killed (caused by broken oaths). pattern thinks that the chance to learn is worth the possible cost of dying again. pattern says that shallan spoke the words, but she lacks truth. adolin appears and embraces her in a hug and kiss. he says that he was visiting all the highprinces delivering an ultimatum to join dalinar or be labeled as someone who refused to fulfill the vengeance pact. shallan says she saw a dead chasm fiend that she wants to draw for him. adolin apologizes for rescuing his father instead of her, and promises to protect her but she says that she doesn't need protecting and that she will never be 'something' to be locked away again, though she doesn't elaborate on when she was previously locked away. dalinar and navani enter, and dalinar has a request, but shallan anticipates him and requests to go on the expedition despite the dangers since she thinks the ancient city that jasnah was searching for is there. dalinar asks her to expand on their map of the shattered plains and she says she will do so. shallan also requests that they leave the parshmen behind since jasnah felt they were dangerous, and dalinar says that he will do so, and that they are leaving within the hour. interludes[edit] interlude i-12: lhan[edit] pai, a devout female ardent, is assigned to be mentored by brother lhan in kholinar so that she can join queen aesudan's retinue as she requests. lhan explains that the ardents are rewarded well by the queen as long as they make her feel that she is religiously devout, though pai feels that the queen lives too luxuriously while there are starving alethi. lhan feels that he has to persuade pai to be less confrontational and more accepting of the queen's lack of religious orthodoxy. lhan tries to explain how comfortable pai's life will be but this seems to only make pai more disagreeable. lhan then shows pai some wasted rotting food, and tries to convince her that if she is allowed to stay that she will be able to have a positive effect in the city by being given an opportunity to help the poor, but that she won't be allowed to stay if she maintains a contrary position to the lazy lives of the queen's ardents. after given several hours to think, pai questions lhan about the lack of spirituality in alethkar, and about how the elite only go through the motions but aren't really devout. pai says that she will comply with his request to fit in with the ardent's lazy lifestyle and lead by example and do what good she could, though lhan isn't entirely confident that she won't cause trouble. lhan arrives at the palace the next day to find that pai has painted the throne room with large glyphs depicting the ten foolish attributes, and how the queen exemplifies them. pai is subsequently executed, and the alethi riot in protest of this. interlude i-13: a part to play[edit] eshonai tries to ignore a voice that screams deep within her. venli and eshonai discuss the upcoming alethi attack on narak, and eshonai says they should wait and try to surprise their foes with an unexpected highstorm that blows in an opposite direction from regular highstorms. eshonai isn't happy with how comfortable venli and her scholars are with the new stormform, but goes about her training of soldiers for the upcoming battle. interlude i-14: taravangian[edit] taravangian awakes on a ship with stiff muscles, but noting that he doesn't feel stupid, which he considers a good sign. he notes that his ship has moored on time, when his servants arrive. maben brings him his morning meal, but is stopped by mrall, one of the kings testers. he wants taravangian to take the test first since it is an important day and he wants to know what to expect. taravangian agrees with him and mrall lets the testers approach. the three stormwardens give the king some paper on which some math-problems are put down with figures and glyphs. taravangian made these himself on one of his better days and even though he knows he is not a complete idiot, he finds that he is only average on this day. after checking the papers the stomwardens judge: ""he is fit to serve,"" one proclaimed. ""he may not change the diagram, but he may interact outside of supervision, may change policy, and pass judgment."" mrall, after getting taravangian's acceptance, lets maban bring him his breakfast. taravangian considers that, even though it always takes up one hour of every day, the test is the best way for a man who wakes up every morning with a different level of intelligence. he contemplates that life can be tricky especially when the world might depend on him. taravangian and his retinue enter the battlefield outside vedenar, where his countrymen setup healing tents to tend to the wounded, and where they are welcomed and cheered for their mercy and aid, as the diagram predicted, despite the fact that he was behind the civil war. taravangian and adrotagia speculate on the thrill and nergaoul. as taravangian talks to the soldiers to show his compassion, he is confronted by szeth who says they need to speak. taravangian panics and makes sure he still has the oathstone. they talk quietly and szeth says that there is a problem, that dalinar has a surgebinder and taravangian thinks he found out about jasnah and thinks she faked her own death. szeth says that he fought a male surgebinder who protected dalinar, which surprises taravangian, and makes him wonder how szeth will deal with the fact that he was right about the voidbringers returning. taravangian says that szeth must have fought someone who had an honorblade, and must return to kill dalinar and avoid fighting kaladin. taravangian's cabal discuss the possible identity of the surgebinder, and he consults the diagram, and tells adro that he asked the nightwatcher for capacity to save humankind from the desolations. taravangian guesses from one of the passages that one of the bridgemen that dalinar took is the surgebinder, and that they must keep szeth from him at all costs, to maintain control of their assassin. taravangian then goes to see king valam, who is dying. valam is upset how coy taravangian is, and knows that taravangian is feigning neutrality, but will soon press his valid but hidden claim for the throne of jah keved once valam dies. valam tells his scribe that he is making taravangian his heir, and is shocked to learn all the other highprinces are dead. valam asks his son redin to stab him in the heart to put him out of his misery, and he does so when prodded, and as he dies, he has a death rattle. taravangian thinks he succeeded as the diagram instructed him to become king of jah keved, and is unifying the world as gavilar insisted was necessary based on visions that he had. part five: winds alight[edit] chapter 76: the hidden blade[edit] ""they will come you cannot stop their oaths look for those who survive when they should not that pattern will be your clue."" kaladin kaladin has insomnia and worries that he killed sylphrena. he leaves his bed and tells lopen that he wants to watch the army depart. lopen asks why he doesn't use stormlight to heal and he says he lost his ability and that syl is gone, and lopen tries to give him advice to get syl to return. kaladin gasps in awe and tells lopen that the gathered armies appeared as kaladin had imagined them to be when he was younger. kal and lopen go to see bridge four off on the expedition. dalinar dalinar expresses surprise to roion that sebarial is bringing his army. dalinar says as much to sebarial who replies that he thinks there are opportunities for him out on the plains and he wants to be thought of as arriving before highprince aladar joined them, further surprising dalinar. sadeas ialai tells sadeas they could try seizing power in a coup, as they scout sebarial's farms west of the warcamps. sadeas says it won't be necessary and that dalinar won't survive the expedition. a messenger arrives and delivers unpleasant news. dalinar dalinar questions why aladar is joining them since he was always a supporter of sadeas, and he replies that he won't stand by while two of the least brave highprinces march to war to fulfill the vengeance pact. dalinar demands a vow of loyalty from aladar, and decides that he will trust him out of necessity though he will make sure that he is not in a position to be betrayed again. amaram questions dalinar's decision to trust sebarial and aladar, and mentions the glory they could have by leaving them out, and dalinar says that he hopes they are above that. as they ride, dalinar sees kaladin and bridge four, and tells amaram to come with him to speak to them to put the rumors of what kaladin said about amaram behind them. kaladin kaladin feels jealous of adolin over shallan, but his admiration for adolin overcomes that and he thinks they belong together. kaladin thinks that he should talk to renarin about his condition and find out if anything else is going on. the bridgemen all berate kaladin for not recuperating from his injuries. dalinar and amaram appear, and kaladin suppresses his hatred after the punishment that he had to endure after his challenge was turned down. kaladin asks who is watching elhokar, and teft says they left their best man, and kaladin realizes that would be moash, and silently curses to himself. dalinar asks amaram to confirm his story that he never met kaladin before and that he didn't steal his shards from kaladin and amaram concurs with these statements, saying that kal's claims are preposterous. dalinar says an apology is in order, and interrupts kaladin and looks at amaram who is shocked. dalinar explains his sting operation with bordin and taln to trick amaram, then summons a shardblade and holds it to amaram's throat right before amaram summons his own. dalinar demands an explanation for amaram's lies and deceit, and amaram says that he did it for the greater good since the voidbringers are returning. amaram apologizes to kaladin, who realizes with shock that amaram is sincere despite the means that he used to achieve his goals. dalinar accuses amaram of murder, but amaram counters that dalinar has sent many soldiers to death to win gemhearts. dalinar tells amaram to remove his cloak since he is no radiant, and lets him go for now against kal's protest, and says that he will face justice at a later time. kaladin thanks dalinar for believing him, and dalinar tells him to get rest. kaladin says for dalinar to stay safe, and dalinar replies that him having a shardblade, though it feels wrong, will help him if szeth shows up. sadeas sadeas is upset that aladar is joining dalinar, and makes plans to replace the highprinces that he thinks will die on the expedition. chapter 77: trust[edit] ""one danger in deploying such a potent weapon will be the potential encouragement of those exploring the nahel bond. care must be taken to avoid placing these subjects in situations of powerful stress unless you accept the consequences of their potential investiture."" shallan shallan is excited as the armies begin their march across the plains. adolin and shallan banter as they ride. shallan is briefly distracted by thoughts of kaladin. adolin suggests that shallan ride in sebarial's carriage and she says that if she could walk through a highstorm then she can ride, but he warns her of saddle soreness which is a hazard of riding. gaz appears and delivers a copy of words of radiance as she requested and she thanks him. shallan rides in a private coach, with pattern, reading her new book, which tells of the orders of the knights radiant and their traditions, abilities, and attitudes, though some of it is based on hearsay since it was written two hundred years after the recreance. shallan wonders about the different orders, and if surgebinders would start appearing. navani joins her in her coach and apologizes for neglecting shallan and asks to help with her research. the two bond over their shared feelings of inadequacy around jasnah. shallan and navani discuss plans to narrow down where stormseat is located and how to open the oathgate. shallan says that jasnah expected urithiru to have information about the knights radiant and voidbringers, and navani replies that she was, like dalinar, trying to bring back powers that should be left alone. shallan reveals that jasnah actually succeeded and that jasnah could soulcast on her own without a soulcaster, and that her fabrial was a fake. navani is alarmed by this since the radiants are linked to the return of the voidbringers, and leaves to make preparations. kaladin kaladin feels gloomy as he is stuck in a sickbed during the dreary weeping period. moash visits kal and explains the plan to kill elhokar and make dalinar the new king, and that kaladin won't need to do anything. kal tells him that he lost his abilities and that he thinks syl left him because of the assassination plot. moash says he visited to deliver a message for kaladin to visit the drunk king, but will tell elhokar that kaladin isn't up for it, and leaves after making sure kaladin isn't having second thoughts about the planned assassination. kaladin feels helpless at this point to stop the plot, being wounded and powerless. chapter 78: contradictions[edit]

draws a sketch of jasnah based on a memory of her on the wind's pleasure. pattern sees some creationspren fade out and comments how useless they are. they discuss the nature of perception and lies, the latter a subject that fascinates pattern. dalinar joins shallan in her tent and she takes a memory since she has no sketches of him. dalinar asks for privacy, and shallan's guard and the scribes leave. dalinar asks about shallan telling about jasnah discovering the secrets of the radiants and she verifies what she said is true. dalinar says he thinks he is supposed to refound the knights, but that he chose the wrong person to lead them, and that they might be refounding themselves. shallan asks dalinar if he is supposed to gather the radiants instead of refounding them, then she demonstrates her ability which leaves dalinar in awe. dalinar says he should put shallan in charge of the radiants but she demurs using an awkward phrase, but they are then interrupted by an alert of parshendi being spotted. dalinar goes to investigate and shallan follows, assuring him that she can handle the danger. she says that she can also soulcast but not well, and asks her abilities to be kept a secret and he says he will only tell navani but she says not to, and that she isn't really under his authority. dalinar acquiesces to her demands but says they will talk further, and says that she gives him hope. a scout reports that they spotted the parshendi, and lost three men but killed one of the foes and they appear different from past parshendi, and the scouts had burn wounds oddly enough, despite the rain. shallan examines the corpse and sees that its eyes are red and is alarmed. teleb reports that another parshendi walked up to the army, not attacking but just standing, and dalinar and shallan go to investigate. the parshman, rlain, calls out to some of the bridgemen. skar verifies that he used to be in bridge four and now wants to surrender to dalinar. chapter 79: toward the center[edit] ""q: for what essential must we strive? a: the essential of preservation, to shelter a seed of humanity through the coming storm. q: what cost must we bear? a: the cost is irrelevant. mankind must survive. our burden is that of the species, and all other considerations are but dust by comparison."" dalinar and navani interrogate rlain in his tent. dalinar notices how much different he appears from regular parshmen. rlain salutes dalinar and sits as instructed. rlain doesn't know any of the parshendi plans and says he was a parshman spy for about three years. rlain says that something is wrong and that eshonai has changed in a bad way and that all his friends among the listeners have become monsters, and that he has nothing left. skar and rock disagree and say rlain is still a member of bridge four. rlain tells that although he is a parshendi, he was able to spy on the alethi because he changed into dullform to closely impersonate a parshman and that no one would suspect or complain of having an extra parshman slave. dalinar asks about the red eyes and rlain replies that it means their gods have returned, the souls of those ancient who hate the alethi and want to bring something terrible. dalinar tells rlain to lead the alethi army to rlain's people and that dalinar will protect the innocent and non-combantants and try to save them from destruction. rlain is released into the custody of bridge four. chapter 80: to fight the rain[edit] ""you must become king. of everything."" shallan shallan climbs up a rock formation to get a good view of the ruins of an old city. shallan reluctantly returns to the tents to join a war council among the highprinces. shallan tells dalinar they must push onward. adolin reports that ten thousand parshendi have been spotted on the nearby plateaus. dalinar decides they will march toward the city the next day and attack. everyone leaves but dalinar, navani and shallan. shallan tells the two that the oathgate is real according to jasnah, and dalinar thinks they might need it in case of emergency to escape. kaladin kaladin walks through the near deserted camp to think and try to put his losses behind him. he returns to his barracks and finds elhokar is waiting for him. elhokar speaks with kal privately and asks how kaladin knows how to be a hero. elhokar complains that he is incompetent even though the almighty gave him the throne. elhokar asks kal if he is a bad king, and kal replies yes. kal thinks he could kill the king then and there and wonders if he should, but then realizes that while it would be good for the people, he doesn't want to fail dalinar. kaladin suggests that elhokar resign, which angers the king. elhokar then says that when kaladin came, that the shadows that haunted him vanished and that there is something special about kaladin. elhokar apologizes for his previous treatment and imprisonment of kaladin which was out of jealousy, and admits culpability for their failure to deal with sadeas, and leaves. chapter 81: the last day[edit] ""the unmade are a deviation, a flair, a conundrum that may not be worth your time. you cannot help but think of them. they are fascinating. many are mindless. like the spren of human emotions, only much more nasty. i do believe a few can think, however."" dalinar dalinar goes to the edge of a plateau and looks across a chasm to see a large group of parshendi with glowing red eyes. dalinar calms down the other highprinces and gives orders for the army to be prepared for battle. navani says she can't hide from danger since she has to setup her fabrials. dalinar gives a motivational speech to nearby soldiers saying that he was sent from the almighty with knowledge of what they face from visions of the past and to trust that the voidbringers will be countered by the radiants as in the past. as they wait to join the battle, the parshendi start singing. rlain appears as summoned and says that song is of death and destruction and power. the parshendi start glowing, and rlain tells dalinar that they must stop the song or else. heeding the countdown that says this is the last day that it was leading to, dalinar orders that his army attack immediately. kaladin kaladin walks through the lighteyes training ground, still injured and walking with a crutch. kal talks with zahel who says the purelake reminds him of his home unlike the shattered plains. zahel says they flooded the training grounds to wash the sand with the weeping rains. kal says he is looking for wit but zahel says he isn't around. kal explains his dilemma vaguely and zahel replies to choose the option that lets him sleep best at night. kal tries to practice his spear forms but has difficulty due to his injury. kal has a realization that elhokar is dalinar's tien. adolin adolin receives his orders to attack and orders his soldiers to be ready to charge against the parshendi. after receiving the signal, his group charges, but they get hit by a lightning blast which kills sureblood and throws adolin from the saddle, dazing him briefly. adolin sees flashes of red lightning taking out his soldiers. he yells at his men to advance as if they were fighting archers. he is struck directly by a bolt of lightning but it only blinds him momentarily. he suspects his shardplate and helm provide some sort of immunity or protection to the parshendi lightning attacks. he subsequently uses his shardblade to attack and kill some parshendi, and he sees small red spren leave the corpses and vanish. shallan shallan sketches a map of the nearby plateaus so they can try to locate the oathgate, as a scout reports on the local terrain and parshendi locations. pattern says something is very bad. inadara implies that pattern is related to the voidbringers and pattern replies that she is more likely to be one, causing her to be annoyed. renarin studies pattern closely. pattern says the red stormspren are a form of voidspren that present a great danger. another scout arrives and says that shallan's drawing of the central plateau is wrong and that it is actually round, not thin and long, and this alarms shallan. dalinar dalinar orders renarin to find some soldiers to accompany shallan, and to lead them. he sees that the fighting is tough but his men are holding against the wind and lightning attacks. dalinar redeploys his soldiers and orders navani's fabrials to be used. as he walks, he hears a voice and realizes it is the same one he has heard in his visions. chapter 82: for glory lit[edit] ""there is one you will watch. though all of them have some relevance to precognition, moelach is one of the most powerful in this regard. his touch seeps into a soul as it breaks apart from the body, creating manifestations powered by the spark of death itself. but no, this is a distraction. deviation. kingship. we must discuss the nature of kingship."" kaladin kaladin returns to the palace to save elhokar, and notices there are no guards which alarms him. he reaches elhokar's rooms and sees two unfamiliar men, who work for graves. they tell kaladin that everything is taken care of and to return to his barracks. with effort, kal ambushes and incapacitates them. he enters the room and finds the king lying down on a couch and not moving. adolin adolin battles but the parshendi try to ensnare him using ropes. perel reports that both forces are currently evenly matched, and that the singing parshendi are not joining the battle. adolin decides to go after the singers and has a battalion gathered to go after them while perel provides a distraction. dalinar dalinar addresses the voice he hears, but the voice says it is not the almighty, but rather a sliver of him left after he was killed by odium. a messenger reports that teleb has fallen and roion routed. dalinar takes the messenger's horse and goes to the battlefront to get a firsthand look at the status. he goes to navani and tells her to execute her plan immediately. a line of archers under a covered pavilion is exposed to the chasm front, with fabrials draining moisture from the air, and the archers join the battle to attack the parshendi who are surrounding roion's forces. kaladin kaladin relaxes as elhokar is alive but drunk, and the king sulks. kaladin warns that assassins are coming and they must seek safety. as they leave, one of grave's men surprises and stabs elhokar in the side, before kal can stab him with his spear. the king is bleeding though not critically injured. kal tells elhokar to put pressure on his wound, and the king sees that kal is also bleeding. kal tells elhokar not to give up as they flee. moash and graves, both in shardplate, appear. chapter 83: time's illusion[edit] ""obviously they are fools the desolation needs no usher it can and will sit where it wishes and the signs are obvious that the spren anticipate it doing so soon the ancient of stones must finally begin to crack it is a wonder that upon his will rested the prosperity and peace of a world for over four millenia."" shallan shallan and renarin along with some soldiers and bridgemen enter a deserted circular plateau after skirting along the battle lines. she explains that this must be where the oathgate is because it seems to be the center from which the shattered plains was broken. pattern says the voidspren are raising a storm, and renarin says the winds are blowing the wrong way, from west to east, and that is an everstorm. shallan tells them to search the area for anything out of the ordinary. they find a large rock mound and renarin cuts a hole into it at shallan's request. adolin adolin and his soldiers enter a chamber in the rock formation behind the parshendi lines, after adolin cut a hole in the rock using his shardblade. adolin tells his force that he will cut a hole in the wall behind their foes and that they are to attack the singing parshendi who are on the other side of the wall. adolin's group is able to ambush the singers who are disoriented briefly when they stop singing to fight back. adolin is disgusted by the ease with which he kills his foes, instead of feeling the 'thrill' as usual. he dismisses his shardblade but is then attacked by eshonai and he then happily resummons his blade in order to face the worthy foe. dalinar dalinar retreats from the battle to get a spear wound treated by physicians. the survivors of roion's army follow him. navani shows up and dalinar tells her they are losing the battle, though navani says that adolin won his plateau. roion yells in panic that they are losing, and dalinar hears the voice that says it should not end this way. dalinar asks who the voice is and realizes the voice is the stormfather, who calls dalinar a child of honor. the stormfather says he is both spren and god and that the parshendi are summoning an opposing deadly storm and that all he can do is bring a storm of cleansing to wash away their bodies. dalinar is angered and denounces the stormfather for abandoning them. the stormfather says he has to go since his daughter is disobeying and that dalinar will see no more visions. dalinar pleads for him to not leave. kaladin kaladin stands before elhokar's unconscious body as moash approaches. graves yells at moash who in turn replies that kaladin is indeed trustworthy. kal recognizes that they are in the same hallway as where szeth previously attacked. moash tries to get kal to stand down, saying the king is probably already dead, but kal refuses and says that moash is betraying bridge four, and that kal is trying to repent by doing the right thing now. moash and kaladin argue and kaladin tries to get moash to pursue justice against roshone who was responsible for the death of moash's grandparents, and that moash's method is not honorable. kal refuses to back down and moash readies to fight. chapter 84: the one who saves[edit]

large circular room covered with majestic images on the wall and floor. she believes that this is where the portal is. there are ten equal divisions in the floor mural and an eleventh narrower one representing urithiru. renarin says it is coming. pattern says the everstorm has been summoned and that there is another highstorm and that the two will collide nearby, causing a very devastating storm. shallan tells renarin to insert his shardblade into a keyhole to try to activate the gate but nothing happens. shallan tells the bridgemen to get their armies onto this plateau so that they can escape, while the scholars try to figure out how to work the oathgate. adolin adolin and eshonai duel amidst the storm and battle. eshonai thinks she is winning, but she gets reckless and adolin is able to knock her into a chasm by slamming into her chest and knocking her backward. adolin almost falls but is grabbed by skar and drehy and other soldiers who pull adolin back away from the chasm ledge. adolin returns to the central plateau to get an update and stops someone who looks like a cloaked messenger but it turns out to be szeth. kaladin kaladin tries to attack with his spear, but moash breaks it then hits him hard with a shard-aided punch, and kaladin crumbles in pain with broken ribs. moash and graves try to set the scene up to implicate szeth as elhokar's assassin. kaladin hears a distant argument between sylphrena and the stormfather. moash and graves argue over which one of them will kill elhokar. kaladin thinks that he will protect even those he hates so long as it's right, his next oath, and explains it to himself why he must do so since that is what is right. kaladin struggles to stand up and draws his knife and places himself between the assassins and elhokar. kaladin stands in defiance and hears syl claim him and stand down the stormfather's argument. graves says that kaladin must die, and kaladin drops his knife. kaladin speaks his third oath as instructed to do by sylphrena and the stormfather accepts the words. syl appears and tells kaladin to hold his hand out, and she becomes a shardblade in his hand. kaladin breathes in and drains the stormlight from all the nearby spheres, exploding with light and blinding moash as he heals himself. wind blows in through burst shutters and a glyph resembling wings forms in frost on the ground. kaladin says the knights radiant have returned, and graves yells out that the diagram spoke of this but that they didn't realize what it referred to until it was too late, saying they were trying to separate kal from dalinar but not realizing the implications. moash and graves flee. kaladin puzzles over graves' words, realizing that dalinar is in danger, and syl tells him something is still very wrong. chapter 85: swallowed by the sky[edit] ""but who is the wanderer, the wild piece, the one who makes no sense? i glimpse at his implications, and the world opens to me. i shy back. impossible. is it?"" dalinar peet reports to dalinar and navani that shallan said there were two storms converging on their location. cael reports that aladar won his plateau and that they were defeating the parshendi. they plan to relocate to where shallan is to try to flee to safety. adolin suddenly flies into the tent, battered and missing parts of his shardplate. szeth arrives nearby as dalinar looks up. shallan shallan tries to figure out the puzzle of opening the oathgate. renarin speaks cryptically about seeing the future and that the end has come. dalinar fearing the end as szeth approaches, dalinar speaks to adolin about being a good leader when adolin ultimately takes over their princedom. dalinar tells adolin that he was taught well and is a good man and that adolin isn't a tyrant like dalinar originally was, and to unite the highprinces. dalinar tells bridge four to back off, and asks szeth why he killed gavilar. szeth replies that he obeys his masters without explanation and that he will get what he is owed. szeth attacks and is parried by dalinar, causing szeth to smile wickedly. adolin adolin struggles to his feet, watching dalinar and szeth battle and seeing another storm forming. he tells skar and drehy to help him remove his battered (non-functioning) shardplate. dalinar dalinar thinks of his brother as he fights szeth. eventually szeth gets a stormlight aided punch through and breaks dalinar's ribs, taking him out of the fight. dalinar comes to the realization that he would not have been able to save his brother's life against szeth, bringing peace to his soul. szeth approaches to finish the fight, but is attacked by roion. adolin adolin watches as szeth slices up roion's sword and lashes him to the sky, causing him to fly up. szeth then slays a dozen soldiers easily. adolin attacks but is easily parried. roion soon comes crashing down to the earth and is instantly killed from the impact. adolin is joined by some bridgemen and soldiers, but szeth manages to knock him back with a forceful swing of his shardblade. szeth reaches dalinar and touches him, causing him to fly up into the sky (in the same manner as roion), then walks away. adolin follows but stops as szeth says that he is done. adolin moves to strike at szeth but the parrying blow breaks his wrist and szeth moves in for the kill as adolin loses his blade. he looks up in surprise to see dalinar floating back down slowly. szeth looks up in horror to see kaladin crash into the ground holding a shardblade, leaving a swordlike glyph where he landed. kaladin says that he claims the sky and winds, and szeth's life. chapter 86: patterns of light[edit] ""one is almost certainly a traitor to the others."" kaladin kaladin watches as szeth reacts in horror to his arrival and dalinar's safe landing. kal tells dalinar to seek shelter as he flew over a storm while traveling. kaladin says he will deal with szeth and says 'yes' when dalinar asks if kal is what dalinar has been looking for. teft and bridge four members throw down lanterns with infused gems for kaladin to drain for investiture. kaladin attacks szeth, angered and ready to avenge the fallen bridgemen. shallan shallan asks to have renarin quieted while she tries to figure out the pattern to opening the oathgate and realizes that the lock is a fabrial. dalinar dalinar asks for a status report on their retreat as he watches kaladin fight szeth. he helps adolin to his feet and confirms that kaladin is a radiant, making adolin smile in realization. adolin heads toward where shallan is, along with some bridgemen. dalinar finds his horse, then goes toward shallan's plateau, finding roion's army heading that way. dalinar encounters sebarial, who is in repose with palona, and who says that he helped organize the retreat, and gives an update on the armies. aladar reports on his victory and proclaims the vengeance pact fulfilled due to the overwhelming number of parshendi slain, as the soldiers gather on one plateau. dalinar explains that victory feels like exhaustion and pain and suffering, and that they need to fit everyone close together on the plateau to be ready to get through the portal. kaladin kaladin flies through the air chasing szeth as syl flies around him, saying that she was only as dead as his oaths. kaladin asks about the out of season highstorm, and syl says the stormfather caused it to try to end it all and wash everyone away and hide from the future. kaladin flies high enough to break the storm ceiling into sunlight and finds szeth. szeth claims that kaladin stole an honorblade but he denies this. szeth attacks and syl changes into a spear so that kaladin can more easily parry. szeth observes this but clings to his denial of kaladin being a radiant. shallan shallan infuses spheres in the chamber with stormlight, not bothering to conceal her abilities. she runs out of stormlight and cries for more gemstones. she sees adolin leading the soldiers and goes to him briefly. adolin sees her glowing and says, 'you too?' and she replies 'yes, sorry' then yells for them to hurry. kaladin kaladin and szeth battle, using lashings to maneuver back and forth as the two storms crash into each other below. szeth says the knights can't be back but kal retorts that they are and will kill him. szeth manages to stab kaladin but he is able to heal his wound though it consumes a lot of stormlight. szeth boasts that he will win due to his experience but kal says that the sky is and was always his. kal starts fighting instinctually and manages to strike szeth as syl changes weapon forms (e.g., sword to spear to hammer to spear, etc.) while they fight, though szeth dodges a killing blow. kaladin sees the top of the plateau crest through the clouds, spinning slowly. szeth lands on the surface, chased by kaladin. szeth again yells that the voidbringers can't be back, and heads back toward where dalinar is in order to complete his assigned assassination. shallan shallan gets the last spheres lit as time is running out, and the floor begins to glow. shallan tells adolin to put his shardblade into the keyhole but nothing happens. she realizes what the problem is, and summons pattern in blade form, and puts him in the key hole, causing a reaction as she senses something unlock deep inside the plateau. shallan and adolin push against pattern (in the form of an inserted blade/lever) along a ridge in the circular wall to where the picture of urithiru is, and she then pulls pattern out. the lamps then fade out. kaladin kal follows szeth into the storm as syl admonishes caution because the stormfather hates him and this is his domain and that another worse storm brews as well. kaladin and szeth both reinvest their stormlight from the storm. szeth reaches the plateau before kaladin but it is mysteriously empty. adolin adolin cuts a hole in the stone, revealing sunlight. they look outside and find the gathered armies on the plateau, but it has relocated to the mountain range that also houses urithiru. kaladin szeth screams at kaladin as red spren zip around in the tempest. szeth realizes that dalinar and the armies went to urithiru, and flies off toward the west, chased by kal. kaladin chases with difficulty and they both reach the stormfront and break through it, and kaladin stabs szeth in his foot. kaladin manages to smash szeth in his shoulder as they fight just ahead of the highstorm. as they fight, szeth finally acknowledges the truth and says that he was right all along and never truthless, and that he could have stopped murdering at any time. szeth stops fighting, and kaladin is about to make a killing strike, but instead slices his wrist, sending the honorblade tumbling down. syl urges kaladin to grab the sword, and kaladin dives after it as szeth falls to the ground, no longer lashed and pummeled by the storm. kaladin stays hovering surrounded by windspren, and syl says she may keep kaladin around. syl demands compliments and a smile. chapter 87: the riddens[edit] ""chaos in alethkar is, of course, inevitable. watch carefully, and do not let power in the kingdom solidify. the blackthorn could become an ally or our greatest foe, depending on whether he takes the path of the warlord or not. if he seems likely to sue for peace, assassinate him expeditiously. the risk of competition is too great."" kaladin sylphrena says that the other storm which is blowing from west to east is of him, not us, but that she doesn't know what will happen. kaladin wonders where the army vanished to as he stands on the empty plateau where the army had been. syl verifies that shardblades are dead spren, but they gain a little life when summoned, and that forces, unlike people, can be broken without being completely destroyed. kaladin asks why szeth's blade doesn't scream and syl says it is not a spren but something different and dangerous. she says she thinks it is an honorblade of the heralds, and that its grants its holder the powers of a windrunner, and that the honorblades were given by honor to men and that spren are based on those blades, and that it is valuable. she explains that the blade gives the abilities without the checks a spren requires but that it requires dangerous amounts of stormlight. kaladin encounters some men from bridge four, including rock and teft. kaladin says the new blade was szeth's and he is now dead. bisig says that radiant girl showed them how to bring the plateau back, and kaladin realizes that must be shallan and that she is either a radiant or has an honorblade. kaladin gets a status report, and wonders what he should say about moash, and realizes he can't keep his abilities a secret. teft says some of the bridgemen began to glow and that the bridgemen might be part of the radiants' hierarchy as well. teft tells kaladin that his eyes turned light and kaladin silently curses. kal summons syl to operate the lock fabrial to transport them. shallan shallan stands by the gates of urithiru, watching as people begin exploring the city. pattern says that shallan is almost a radiant and will be so once she speaks truths. shallan guesses that their location is in the mountains near tu bayla or perhaps emul. shallan checks in with dalinar as scribes send messages via spanreed warning of the storm blowing in the wrong direction. dalinar reports that elhokar vanished and that kholinar is in riot. shallan sees a flash that marks the return of kaladin and bridge four. kaladin floats over, carrying a shardblade, and reports that szeth is dead and that elhokar was wounded but relocated to a safe house that no one would think of. lopen lopen experiments with an infused gemstone as his mother implores elhokar to eat his chouta. chilinko tells lopen they may need to move from their house in sebarial's warcamp as there is word that something was found on the plains. lopen manages to drain some stormlight briefly and sees new flesh growing where his arm is missing, and he then demands more spheres from his family, proclaiming in triumph. moash moash rides on a cart heading out of the warcamps, with his armor packed away. graves joins him and points out some scavengers going through the warcamps to loot them. he says they will get what is coming to them when the everstorm arrives. moash thinks to himself in disbelief that he was a traitor and that he tried to kill kaladin and failed to kill elhokar. graves explains what he knows from the diagram though it is vague, and curses that jasnah was right about the voidbringers being the parshmen. moash asks who graves really is, and he replies that he is a patriot who interpreted the diagram incorrectly. graves tells moash that he will bring him into the diagram and that they have important work ahead in saving the world. moash thinks he was played but still goes along. chapter 88: the man who owned the winds[edit] ""1173090605 1173090801

piece of paper marked with the ghostblood symbol and her real name, which alarms her. she enters a nearby room where mraize awaits her, and readies to draw pattern just in case, acknowledging to herself that pattern is not a typical blade. mraize says that she gave herself away by using her abilities while saving the army, and suggests that veil is her true identity, not shallan. mraize speculates on how people will see shallan, and says that the ghostbloods take care of their own including her. she angrily declares that the ghostbloods killed jasnah, but mraize calmly replies that jasnah had assassinated some of their members also, and that he should have guessed shallan's identity sooner due to her family's history. shallan says she won't help mraize but he replies that he has her brothers. he also says that he is owed for the broken soulcaster and that she happens to be one. shallan threatens to kill mraize but he says that her brothers will be safe, and then he says that there are answers that she needs to learn about the ghostbloods' purpose and what her brother and father were up to. he says that she can be both a radiant and a ghostblood in her different identities and that she can take time to consider if she wants to join the ghostbloods. she finds adolin and they hug and banter for a bit. adolin leaves after saying that pattern chose her quarters for her. she looks at the wall which resembles the room at her father's home and pattern says it is time for her to be a radiant. she sees an illusion of a room with a white carpet and two corpses on the floor, and a painting outlined with a glow with something hidden behind it. behind the painting, a strongbox is hidden and she opens it and takes out a shardblade that was originally pattern. shallan looks at the corpses of her mother and her mother's friend and talks about how her mother tried to kill shallan when she learned what shallan could do. shallan speaks of how her father took the blame for shallan killing her own mother in self-defense and how it destroyed their family and that pattern says that shallan will get revenge and kill pattern. shallan says she doesn't want revenge, she wants her family. amaram amaram writes a note to restares reporting that voidbringers were spotted and that a new storm was unleashed, and that the world had to be put in crisis for the heralds and church

proud. amaram stealthily cuts his way into the room where taln is being held, thinking of regrets for his loss of friendship with dalinar over kaladin's accusations of murder. as amaram leads taln from the room, taln catches a poison dart in midair that would have hit amaram, and he sees a masked person shoot another dart at him that is also caught before the would-be assassin runs away. amaram then leads taln to his coach. szeth szeth wakes up wondering why he did not die from the shardblade wound. nale is standing there and szeth recognizes him. nale explains how he was brought back to life, and says he is one of szeth's gods, though szeth replies that his gods are the stones, sun and stars, not men. szeth recognizes him as nalan, herald of justice. szeth asks why he was saved since he can't take his torment anymore and nale replies those words are foolish and unbecoming of his apprentice to be. szeth says he wants to die, but then changes his mind and says that he was right and his people wrong. nale says he will teach him to ignore feelings and bring justice to his former leaders. szeth says he is not worthy but nale disagrees saying that he stuck to his personal code at great cost and is worthy to be a skybreaker. nale says that szeth is reborn and is to begin training immediately and that he brought a shardblade for szeth and throws it to the ground. szeth picks up

of his youthful home, and a distant source of warmth, then wakes up in urithiru. he thinks the dream was a vision but there was no highstorm which generally accompanies the visions he has. adolin

and tries to get sadeas to admit that dalinar was right, but sadeas claims it was all a deal worked out with the parshendi as evidenced by rlain being a bridgeman. adolin asks why sadeas wants to knowingly spread lies, and sadeas says that either him or dalinar can succeed but not both. sadeas says that he suffered a temporary setback but will take everything away from dalinar, and this aggravates adolin into attacking sadeas. they grapple, and eventually adolin stabs sadeas in the skull, killing him. he throws away sadeas' shardblade and covers up his tracks and leaves. dalinar dalinar reaches the roof of the central tower. he looks down upon the city, seeing the circular rings that comprise the tower, and pillars that match one in the capital of alethkar where the palace and temple were built. dalinar then looks up and questions the actions of the stormfather that almost led to their destruction. the stormfather explains his purpose and that he is like a spren to the almighty. dalinar swears the first and second ideals of the order of bondsmiths, and the stormfather reluctantly bonds him, though he insists upon dalinar getting rid of his shardblade and refuses to be summoned as one. the stormfather says that he sent no vision that morning and states that dalinars experience was a simple dream, which confuses dalinar, as he felt it was even stronger than a vision. the stormfather bids dalinar to go and lead his people against odium, warning that he is leading them to destruction as dalinar is nothing compared to the almighty. dalinar retorts that if the almighty could be killed, then so can odium. dalinar leaves the tower top and goes to another room near the top where shallan and kaladin await. dalinar takes out a sphere and draws stormlight into himself in response to kaladin's inquiry, and feels his injuries heal. dalinar explains that he is a bondsmith and shallan says there are three knights but is corrected by renarin, who walks in and reveals himself to be a truthwatcher. dalinar explains that the parshmen are all being changed by the everstorm and that they must prepare. kaladin says he has to go home to warn his parents, leaves with dalinar's blessing to pack for the journey. dalinar sends renarin to elhokar (who has arrived with the herdazians with whom he was hiding) to acquire spheres for kaladin; he muses that now renarin is a radiant, he should stop sending him on menial errands. dalinar and shallan, now alone, speak of the tasks facing them to save as many people as possible, reciting the first ideal again. epilogue: art and expectation[edit] wit talks to himself about art and beauty and expectation while he waits for jasnah to transport herself from the cognitive realm. she asks how he found her and he replies that she made a large disturbance on the other side. jasnah threatens and interrogates wit, but he brushes these off and says he is already aware of the important tidings she brings. wit says the everstorm has arrived and urithiru was located and the knights have been refounded. wit offers to work with jasnah and pool their knowledge as they walk back to civilization, despite the desolation that is beginning to destroy the world. endnote[edit] ""alight, winds approach deadly approaching winds alight."" nazh discusses the ketek found on navani kholin's personal journal, which

Salay,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Salay,"""“guiding the ship is a privilege, and the helmsperson is an officer tasked with a serious duty.”-hoid about salay"" salay is the helmswoman of the crow's song on lumar. like tress, she had set out in search of someone she had lost: her father. after tress returned from her encounter with the dragon xisis, she gave salay a note indicating her father's location to be filistrate city. sometime after the departure of the sorceress, salay and her father were reunited, and he took up the post of apprentice helmsman on their ship, the two cups. appearance and personality[edit] salay is a short, dark skinned woman with black, tightly-curled hair and delicate features. her naval outfit as helmswoman of the crow's song is a coat and stiff trousers. she can have a short temper, but is very loyal to her friends and the crew of her ship; she takes the loss of members of her crew very personally and feels responsible for their wellbeing. ann claims salay is bad at judging people. salay is also quite courageous, being willing to stand up to captain crow and to sail the crimson and midnight seas. attributes and abilities[edit] ""“it’s the helmswoman’s job to protect the ship. keep a steady hand, steer clear of danger. out of storms, away from spore explosions. keep them safe somehow . . .”-salay"" salay is an expert helmswoman. her duties include sailing the ship on the spore seas, charting the distances traveled and avoiding storms as well as possible. the helmswoman also traditionally engages the captain of a captured ship. salay also feels responsible for the welfare of her crewmates in her role as helmswoman. as helmswoman, salay safely navigates the crow's song through battles on the emerald sea,, storms on the crimson sea, and through the maze of rocks surrounding the sorceress's island in the midnight sea. history[edit] early life[edit] salay, like fort, is from the islands of lobu in the sapphire sea. after her father got in debt, she promised him she would pay off his debts by working as a helmswoman. however, before she returned to pay off his debts, he was pressed into labor by the king's collectors. they left him in an unknown debtor's prison. passing royal ships who needed crewmembers pressed him into their crews, leaving him in other prisons after they no longer needed him. salay kept sailing to try to find him. crow's song[edit] captain crow convinced salay and the crew of the crow's song to become pirates as an alternative to fighting in the king's war. salay chose to remain on the ship as a pirate to continue to sail, both because of a love of sailing and in hopes of finding her father. shortly after becoming pirates, salay and the crew are forced to become deadrunners after killing the crew of the oot's dream through laggert and crow's machinations. salay tries to prevent further killing - she stops crow from killing the crew of a captured merchant ship and agrees to sail the crimson sea to avoid raiding more ships. salay comes to believe tress is a king's mask and invites her to a secret meeting with ann and fort to discuss how they plan to react to captain crow's actions. once on the crimson sea, salay manages to navigate through a storm, keeping all of the crew except pakson alive. however, a second storm comes on the crew when the sea is stilled, and salay is unable to do anything to save them. through quick thinking, tress is able to save the ship by growing verdant vines to lift the ship above the crimson spikes until the storm passes. shortly after this, ann, salay, fort, and tress meet to plan how to mutiny against captain crow. crow, however, spies on the meeting with midnight essence. she sends laggart to bring them to the deck at gunpoint. laggert shoots salay in the thigh and then has ann and fort bring her up to the deck. crow challenges the four to a duel and handily defeats them, stepping on salay's wounded leg in the process. when crow takes tress to the lair of the dragon xisis, ulaam applies healing salve to salay's wound, which helps speed up her healing. new hope[edit] when tress returns, she gives salay an envelope with a letter from xisis, which reveals that salay's father is currently in filistrate city. this gives salay new hope and purpose. she helps install tress as the new captain of the crow's song. tress is determined to rescue charlie from the sorceress, and so salay sails the ship to the border of the midnight sea, where they drop anchor. on the way there, salay alerts tress that they had caught hoid throwing supplies overboard on huck's orders. salay tries to convince tress not to go alone onto the midnight sea, but is unsuccessful. once tress does not return, she and the crew decide to sail to the sorceress's island to rescue tress. after being alerted to the dangerous rocks near the island by tress, salay is able to safely sail around the rocks by observing the flow of the spores around the rocks. she, fort, and ann bring hoid to the sorceress's tower, where they are able to help save tress and charlie and to force the sorceress to leave lumar. after sailing out of the midnight sea, the crew sells the crow's song and buys a newer, larger ship - the two cups. they also find salay's father, who becomes the assistant helmsman on the ship. over the next few years, the crew of the two cups, including salay, become quite wealthy due to their ability to trade through the crimson and midnight seas. notes[edit]"

Charlie's father,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Charlie%27s_father,"charlie's father is the duke of diggen's point. he cares little for his son and particularly disapproves of his relationship with tress. appearance and personality[edit] the duke is a tall man, who stands up straight and dresses in military decor covered in military medals that appear to stick his clothes too him. the duke is a very grumpy person, regularly found grumbling in his mansion atop of diggen's point. he is described as taking his job of yelling a lot very seriously. the one time tress remembers seeing the duke smile, he was punishing old lotari for trying to escape the island. history[edit] the duke believes charlie is not fit to be his heir because he is not physically strong, nor is he a war hero. his father even seems to disapprove of his son’s intelligence. after witnessing the close bond between tress and charlie, and as a last attempt to make charlie into a proper heir, the duke takes him off the island to be married to a princess. charlie loves tress and does not wish to marry someone else, so he deliberately acts boring when he is around the princesses such that they will not want to marry him. eventually the duke is so exasperated by charlie that he sends his son to be married to the sorceress, assuming this to be certain death. he then promptly replaces charlie with his nephew, dirk. the duke is happy with this swap, as dirk is strong, a war hero, and doesn’t talk very much. when tress and charlie eventually return from the sorceress’s island, the duke has been left by his wife because she didn’t approve of his getting rid of her son. he is outraged that people are now allowed to leave diggen's point, but is powerless to stop the king's writ from taking affect. notes[edit]"

Shimmerbay,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Shimmerbay,"shimmerbay is a port city in the emerald sea on lumar, and is located far from kingsport. crow decided to sail to shimmerbay so tress could ""escape"" when she tricked crow into thinking that she--if she had the opportunity--would tell the king's men that the crow's song crew killed everyone on the oot's dream, and thus are deadrunners. at shimmerbay, tress decided to become a pirate and joined the crow's song as their sprouter. notes[edit]"
Kingsport,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kingsport,"kingsport is a city presumably in the emerald sea on lumar; it is also presumably the residence of the verdant king, and as such is located on the core archipelago. reports about possible deadrunners are sent to the port, which is located far from shimmerbay. charlie claimed that there was constant war at the port, to the extent that gardeners must be trained in the art of warfare; however, it is likely that this was merely another of his stories. after charlie's disappearance, tress planned to go to kingsport to plead that the king pay charlie's ransom. when she had the opportunity to do so, however, she instead remained with the crew of the crow's song. crow had news via a raven from a contact in kingsport that the remnants of the oot's dream had been found, but that there were no survivors, just the corpse of the one man that crow had left alive. notes[edit]"

Sapphire Sea,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sapphire_Sea,"the sapphire sea, also known as the zephyr sea, is an ocean on lumar. geography[edit] like all oceans on lumar the sapphire sea is made out of aether spores, in particular the zephyr spores which release air when exposed to water. due to its spore type is is considered one of the safer oceans to travel through, and it is inhabited by various peoples. like all seas on lumar, it is pentagonal in shape. it borders either the emerald sea, rose sea, or both, along with three to four unknown seas. culture[edit] the sapphire sea is one of the inhabited seas on lumar, its culture is largely unknown however it appears to be a distinct entity from the nation that the verdant king rules as natives of the sea feel the need to specify him as king of the verdant sea. like most of lumar most of its civilisation exists on a series of islands, many of which are unusually large by lumaran standards. on these islands exists a city that serves as a capital of the sea as well as the islands of lobu. the civilization of these islands favours hunting as a source of pride. elsewhere the zephyr islands are famed for their production of pottery. locations[edit] inhabitants of the sapphire sea[edit] notes[edit]"
Rose Sea,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rose_Sea,"the rose sea is an ocean on lumar and is the source of roseite spores. it borders the emerald sea and four other seas. unlike the crimson sea and midnight sea, the rose sea is safely inhabited. like all seas on lumar, it is pentagonal in shape. both ann and fort claim to have sailed on the rose sea. notes[edit]"
Crimson Sea,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Crimson_Sea,"the crimson sea is an ocean on lumar. it is sometimes nicknamed the domain of the dragon. geography[edit] the crimson sea is notable for its unpredictable weather patterns, which makes it one of the most dangerous seas on lumar. the reason for this danger is due to the fact that the navigation of the seas is based upon the predictability of weather on lumar, and the crimson sea simplifies this down to pure luck. therefore, ships avoid traveling through it, and the sea is mostly uninhabited. it borders the emerald sea and midnight sea, along with three other unnamed seas. known residents[edit] notes[edit]"
Lunagree,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lunagree,"""“a great shimmering fountain of colorful motes, vibrant and exceedingly dangerous. ”-hoid"" a lunagree is a location above each of the 12 seas of lumar where aether spores pour down from one of the planet's geostationary moons. sailors on lumar generally stay clear of lunagrees, owing to the danger of getting close to airborne spores. features[edit] as the locations where aether spores rain down into lumar's seas, they are bright and colorful. below a lunagree, the sea is at a higher elevation than elsewhere - crews sailing ships close to one find their vessel at an incline as they near a lunagree. lunagrees[edit] verdant lunagree[edit] the verdant lunagree is located close to diggen's point in the emerald sea, visible from it between fifty and sixty miles away. crimson lunagree[edit] while sailing the crimson sea, hoid describes the crimson lunagree as ""like a lava flow"". under the curse of the sorceress, he also suggests that it looks like the moon is throwing up. xisis's lair can be found close to the crimson lunagree, though an exact location nearby is not needed and just being close is enough to get a meeting with him. notes[edit]"
Valhav,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Valhav,"valhav was one of the silver kingdoms on roshar during the heraldic epochs. like the other silver kingdoms, its name is symmetrical, owing to vorin tradition. geography[edit] it was in the center of the rosharan continent, bordering sela tales and makabakam to the west, rishir to the north, and alethela to the east. the horneater peaks were part of valhav's territory and defined much of its eastern border. it also had coastline on three major bodies of water: the purelake, the reshi sea, and the tarat sea. the majority of the kingdom's former territory lies in the current-day nation of jah keved, including bavland. other portions of valhav are now part of tu bayla and triax. a tiny piece of its former land is owned by marabethia. notes[edit]"

Pakson,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Pakson,"pakson is a crew member of the crow's song on lumar. appearance and personality[edit] he is bald, though he is not of the age when that might be expected, and has an exceptionally weak chin. his legs seem too large in proportion to his torso, which makes him tall and awkward, especially on land. pakson is also a kind man who always thanks fort for his meals, no matter how bad they are. he regrets not learning how to play an instrument, as he has always loved music. history[edit] pakson was one of the ""dougs"" that first pulled tress onto the crow's song, where he and his sister served as crew members. he checked on tress periodically after her escape from the oot's dream while she clung to a porthole until she fulfilled the fifteen minutes crow set as the point at which the crew could pull her aboard. he was later killed during their voyage into the crimson sea when a wave of crimson spores spilled over the deck and sprouted on contact with someone's vomit. he was impaled by many of the spores, was pinned to the outside of the captain's cabin, and bled out quickly. the crew took him down and cast his corpse into the sea before continuing their voyage. his death discomforted his shipmates, and both tress and salay felt personally responsible for his death. notes[edit]"
Brick,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Brick,"brick is a citizen of diggen's point on lumar where he owns and operates brick's tavern. appearance and personality[edit] brick is a short man; he stands on a stool to reach the eye level of his patrons. attributes and abilities[edit] he is an especially skilled brewer. he crafts some of the finest ale in the region of the emerald sea and it is known as one of the top exports of diggen's point. history[edit] like most residents of diggen's point, brick was not allowed to leave the island, and he presumably spent his whole life there. he brewed exceptionally high-quality beer, and his ale was so renowned that sailors and merchants would make specific trips or stops to get it. he brewed his ale on weekends, and his friend rod would usually assist him. brick sold his beer at a tavern on the island, where many locals would come to have a drink and play darts. at the tavern, brick sometimes enlisted his cousin to help him keep watch over the crowd on nights when things might get rough. lem was a regular patron of the tavern and brick was well acquainted with his daughter, tress. when lem cashed in on multiple favors owed to him, brick was happy to assist tress in her attempt to escape diggen's point so she could search for and rescue charlie. he helped tress sneak onto the oot's dream by providing five barrels of ale plus a sixth ""dummy"" keg that contained gret, sor's daughter. this caused a ""failed inspection"" that was actually a distraction, allowing tress to board the ship. when tress briefly returned to diggen's point after her journey, she took special care to thank brick, gremmy, gret, and sor for their assistance in helping her initially escape the rock. notes[edit]"
Lotari,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Lotari,"lotari is a resident of diggen's point on lumar. history[edit] at some point in their life, lotari attempted to sneak off of diggen's point by stowing away on a merchant ship. lotari failed in this attempt and was punished for it. lotari's punishment was the only time that tress ever saw the duke smile. notes[edit]"
Dirk,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Dirk,"""“though the new heir had the intellect of a soggy piece of bread, he was popular, handsome, and very good at getting other people killed. ”-hoid"" dirk is a young noble on lumar. he is the nephew of the duke of diggen's point. he is appointed as the duke's new heir following the capture of charlie by the sorceress. appearance and personality[edit] dirk is six and a half feet tall, incredibly muscular, and handsome with a very straight jaw. he is approximately the same age as charlie, putting him in his late teens. attributes and abilities[edit] hoid notes that dirk has ""both the jaw and the intellect of a marble bust"". he says very little, and usually responds to questions with a single word or sentence. he is a skilled fencer. he is said to be a ""war hero"", although the only known example of his military leadership is the battle of lakeprivy, where he lost ten thousand men. history[edit] dirk's early history is unclear. he was presumably born into nobility since he is the nephew of a duke; he also served as a member of the verdant king's court and may have lived in kingsport at some point. he was given command of a sizable army at a very young age. the duke had long been disappointed that his son did not fit the mold of a prototypical heir; charlie did not care for fencing, was talkative, and and enjoyed fraternizing with people under his station. still, the duke set out on a journey to find charlie a suitable princess to wed. his efforts were thwarted by charlie, who had promised to return home to tress and therefore intentionally bored every potential bride he met to the point that they refused to marry him. ""“i've rescued your son. the real one. not the walking chin with a six-word vocabulary.”-tress, to the duke"" after a year of this had passed, the town received word that the duke was returning to diggen's point with his heir and new daughter-in-law. the townspeople were surprised when dirk was introduced as the new heir, and the princess of dormancy as his wife. the duke had eventually figured out charlie's deception; with the king's approval, the duke forced charlie to try and marry the sorceress. this would either gain the verdant kingdom an alliance with the sorceress, or get rid of a problematic heir. within hours of learning that charlie's ship had vanished in the dangerous midnight sea, the king declared charlie officially dead; the duke adopted dirk and instated him as his heir. dirk was exactly the type of heir that the duke had always wanted, and he was soon married to the princess in order to solidify a political alliance. the duke threw a large party to celebrate dirk upon their return. the townspeople were confused, but were quickly convinced to toast dirk's marriage when the duke provided free food and drinks. the nobles were very happy with dirk as the new heir, and after a few days none of the common people seemed to care. after tress successfully rescued charlie, the king claimed that he had believed in charlie all along. charlie likely regained his status as the rightful heir to the duchy; the status of dirk and the princess is unclear. notes[edit]"

Aether spores,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Roseite_spores,"aether spores are a type of entity that is formed by aethers on lumar. functioning[edit] each aether spore is associated with one of the 12 lumaran aethers. when exposed to water they immediately transform into the associated aether, this is because of the unstable nature of the lumaran aethers. the water serves as a catalyst and begins a process where in it draws investiture from the spiritual realm in order to allow the transformation to take place. this expansion is very rapid, comparable to lightning. despite expanding even more when put into contact with more water, they do have a maximum extent to which they are able to grow. when they reach this maximum growth potential, they stop reacting with water. the direction and speed of this expansion can be changed by various factors, such as the cognitive phenomena surrounding it, shaped by thoughts and commands. it is also pushed away by steel and attracted by iron. aether spores can be killed by silver and salt, turning grey and losing their reactivity when they touch it. the substance they produce upon expanding also grows grey and dies when coming into contact with silver. dead aether spores will stick to almost anything and can be washed away with soap. aether spores at the bottom of the spore seas undergo a certain method of decomposition which contributes to the seethe and the water cycle. the exact details of this decomposition are unknown, and are a source of confusion and curiosity by in-world scholars such as xisis. types[edit] aether spores are found on the planet lumar, where they rain down in lunagrees from the twelve moons, forming seas on the planet. crimson[edit] ""“one moment you’re enjoying a nice book. the next, you take in an unfortunate breath, get a few crimson spores in your system, and suddenly you’ve turned your skull into a colander. ”-hoid on crimson aether"" crimson aether takes the form of bright red spines or spears that are sharp as a needle and can be deadly on contact. the spines are made of coral, meaning that crimson aether corresponds roughly to the rosharan essence of sinew and the heliodor polestone. nothing is known of crimson aetherbound or their associated bud. on the planet lumar, the local crimson spores rain down from the moon into the crimson sea, one of the deadliest of the spore oceans on the planet. when crimson spores are wet and express their aether, the spines of crimson aether are often the bane of ships, forming impenetrable walls of spines or simply tearing ships apart directly. this danger, in addition to the random patterns of the rainlines in the crimson sea, makes the area uninhabitable and made it nearly impossible to travel or trade across the sea without additional precautions. inadvertently inhaling crimson spores can pierce a person's head with spines, killing them instantly. zephyr[edit] zephyr aether comes from the sapphire sea and releases a burst of air when watered. they are a sapphire blue and appear crystalline. it seems to be a more harmless type of aether unless harnessed properly. these spores are used for a variety of purposes on lumar. it seems to replace gunpowder for their explosives. it is used in the cannons to launch the cannonballs. when these cannons are fired it releases a blue puff of spores. they are also used inside the cannonballs, to shatter the ball when a rosite and wax canister of water is pierced, activating the spores under enemy ships. tress also uses them in her modified flare gun charges, allowing for firing the flare as well as depositing verdant spores to entrap the target. the air produced by zephyr aether is breathable, implying that it contains oxygen. it is used as a low-tech and cheap emergency method of propulsion in space, and for various forms of pneumatic weaponry. verdant[edit] verdant aether spores grow into vines after contact with water. the growth rate of expanding verdant aether is extraordinary, being comparable to lightning. breathing in these spores is known to often lead to death, as they react with saliva and expand, clogging the throat and sinuses. however, they don't often reach the brain. the vines can be given basic commands when fed water, such as grab but don't destroy. if the vines are fully grown, they can be eaten if soaked for a day. they don't provide many calories or nutrients, and people can only survive off of them alone for a few weeks. sunlight[edit] sunlight aether produces light and heat when watered. the spores are used to create signal flares, as well as power ovens. midnight[edit] midnight aether spores create midnight essence, draining hydration from the sprouter through a luhel bond after initial contact with water. feeding the bond more water increases the control the human has over the creature. therefore, under the right circumstances, a person can break another's luhel bond by offering the midnight essence more water than the current host. midnight essence are able to mentally communicate with those they have bonded with. midnight aether, while a midnight essence, are highly resistant to silver. roseite[edit] roseite aether spores produce crystals when they interact with water, which makes them useful to sprouters, who use them to seal holes in hulls. although the spores can be deadly, they are not as dangerous as crimson or midnight spores, and the rose sea on lumar is inhabited. among the aethers, roseite is particularly good at resisting silver. it has also been shown to be repelled by steel, and attracted by iron, this likely applies to all aethers. bone spores[edit] bone spores are a rumored thirteenth variety of aether spores on lumar. the stories are unclear whether they are black or white in coloration, or potentially both. some consider bone spores to be a fanciful legend. technology[edit] various forms of technology make use of aether spores. cannonballs[edit] some cannonballs made use of aetheric internal mechanism in order to increase their usefulness in naval combat on the aether seas. in the center of the cannonball was a sphere made out of roseite aether containing water, which was insulated from the water with wax, and therefore did not react with it. this sphere was surrounded by a charge of zephyr spores. in another part of the device was a small glass container of water adjacent to a clipping of verdant aether. this glass container shattered upon launch, soaking the clipping, thus causing it to expand down a short tube leading to the central mechanism. this pushed a silver-tipped plug towards the roseite sphere, and killed the roseite, leading to the release of the contained water, which reacted with the zephyr and caused a large explosion dousing the target with water and shrapnel. notes[edit]"

Sprouter,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Sprouter,"a sprouter is a position on every ship crew on lumar. sprouters work with aether spores, with their duties including patching holes in the hull with roseite. on the crow's song, the sprouter holds the rank of officer. tools[edit] sprouters make use of various tools in order to manipulate the growth of aether spores. one such tool is a shield-like object made of iron, which attracts spores. another is a steel trowel which repels spores. with these one can manipulate how they grow to ones advantage, typically for the purposes of filling holes in the hull of a ship. the splintbox is another form of tool used by sprouters. they are filled with roseite spores, which grow out the front when the box is filled with water. they are used to plug holes in the hulls of ships. this is a modern tool, and some more traditional sprouters prefer the classical shield and trowel. notable sprouters[edit] notes[edit]"
Longbrow's Straits,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Longbrow%27s_Straits,"longbrow's straits is a waterway that separates the island of thaylenah from the frostlands on mainland roshar. the straits are likely named for the famous sailor longbrow. the straits are lined by tall, sleek lighthouses for navigation. various creatures live in the water, including santhidyn, khornaks, redwaters, and schools of small fish. the straits become narrow near klna city, but in some areas they are wide enough that it can be difficult to see land. history[edit] in 1173, the wind's pleasure traveled the straits, taking shallan and jasnah on their journey from kharbranth to the shattered plains. the seas were relatively calm at the time, but tozbek implied that sailing the straits could sometimes be difficult. shallan noted the dark appearance of the distant frostlands and the cliffs visible on thaylenah. she sighted a rare santhid and ordered the crew to lower her into the water so that she could sketch it. in shadesmar[edit] longbrow's straits corresponds to a landmass in the rosharan subastral (shadesmar). it is located at the south end of the sea of lost lights and it borders the glasswater deep and the luminous shallows. it contains the cognitive realm version of thaylen city and a small lake that is hated by nazh. when kaladin and his companions were trapped in shadesmar in 1174, kaladin realized that the honor's path would sail relatively close to longbrow's straits, and he hoped to reach the landmass there to try and seek out the oathgate in thaylen city. they eventually sighted longbrow's straits, and kaladin flew the party onto the land, which contained a strange, empty glass forest. after a long journey through the forest, they reached thaylen city, where the oathgate was guarded by thousands of enemy spren. notes[edit]"
Weev,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Weev,"weev was a former officer on the crow's song, a ship that sails the planet lumar. he served as the ship's sprouter before being murdered by crow for opposing her desire to make the crew pirates. appearance and personality[edit] a crewmember (doug) from the crow's song describes weev as a nice guy who was terrible at bluffing and playing cards. he was the only one to argue against piracy, and didn't deserve getting murdered. hoid acknowledges that weev was a cunning fellow up until he argued with crow. attributes and abilities[edit] ""“i'd have called him crazier than a nitroglycerin smoothie.”-hoid describing weev"" weev was a sprouter and often used and experimented with aether spores. all sprouters are viewed as crazy, but weev was crazier than the rest. before he died, weev likely did the majority of the cooking for the crew of the crow's song. history[edit] weev had a room on the crow's song with a bed, mirror, and running water, but no silver to allow for experiments with spores. though it was larger than other officer's rooms, it remained unclaimed until tress took his job as a sprouter. while he did use the running water for spore experiments, it was also an excuse to take baths at his leisure. he collected several different types of spores, including zephyr, rose, verdant, sunlight, and midnight spores. he acquired the midnight spores from hoid. in his profession, weev was considered a purist and preferred classical tools over modern ones. his tools for patching holes in the ship included a small iron plate and a steel trowel. over the course of his experiments, he compiled a considerable collection of notes detailing his results and knowledge, but they were not very organized. he was a mental hoarder, and had a tendency to write down random thoughts and half-finished ideas. crow wanted him to figure out how to make cannonballs himself to save money, but he never succeeded. during crow's quest to heal herself, she had secret meetings with weev to help her locate xisisrefliel. according to crow's notes, these ended when he turned to blackmail and crow threw him off the ship. notes[edit]"
Crow,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Crow,"captain crow is captain of the pirate ship crow's song on lumar at the beginning of tress of the emerald sea. she becomes a servant of the dragon xisisrefliel at the bottom of the crimson sea. appearance and personality[edit] crow is a stout, distinctive figure with a black feathered hat, a severe face, and tan skin. her heart is described as a twisted lump of smouldering coal.to the midnight essence, she smells more like a plant than a person. the only time the crew knew her to be mirthful is when a sailor speared himself in the crotch with his own boarding hook. crow considers a nice cup to be loot. ""“she was, it might be noted, a perfect example of why the word jerk needs so many off-color synonyms. one could exhaust all available options, invent a few apt new ones, and still not be able to completely describe her. truly an inspiration to the vulgar poet. ”-hoid"" there are limits to the jerkiness. she works alongside the crew in the rainstorm and gives the crew a barrel of booze after pakson's death. in some cases it's calculated self preservation, as when she acceded to salay on robbing the merchants. salay thinks crow's stubbornness has allowed her to survive the spore infestation for as long as she has. attributes and abilities[edit] crow is a spore eater, which is a symbiosis granting extensive defensive abilities at the cost of constantly draining water from her body. she does not have true control over the verdant vines, with them reacting on their own to protect anything that could bring harm to her. she has survived about 1 year longer than would be expected. she has a sixth sense about others such as a clergyman might have, but she uses it to dominate others. she is also able to best several people in an attempted mutiny without relying on verdant aether powers. she is also a crack shot. she uses midnight essence to spy on her crew members, using midnight aether spores. she apparently must remain close to xisisrefliel to keep the verdant spore in remission. although it isn't known if this is the truth, or a lie to discourage her from escaping. history[edit] the attack on oot's dream was the crew's first voyage as pirates. they sewed their first pirate flag after tress came on board. crow becomes captain of crow's song, a fine merchant vessel, and convinces the crew to turn to piracy as an alternative to participating in the king's war against the sorceress. in collusion with laggart, she plans to cross the line from piracy (for tribute) to deadrunning (extirpation) which will make the entire crew into outlaws among outlaws. the ship's prior sprouter, weev, tried to blackmail her, so she had him executed with the rationale that he wouldn't join the crew in turning to piracy. though tress foils the deadrunner plot, crow conserves her with the plan to exchange tress' services to xisisrefliel for crow being healed from spore eating. she brought tress down to the depths of the crimson sea in order to sell her to xisisrefliel in return for being healed by her condition. however, tress managed to bargain with the dragon in order to turn crow herself in, which he accepted. due to this bargain, crow was kept at the bottom of the sea and forced to serve xisisrefliel for the rest of her life. notes[edit]"
Diggen's Point,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Diggen%27s_Point,"diggen's point is an island in the emerald sea on lumar. it is located near to the verdant lunagree and is ruled by the duke. geography[edit] diggen's point is an island made up almost exclusively of black saltstone, in the shape of an old man's crooked finger. the island appears to reach from below the ocean, to point towards the horizon. the island is home to a small town, and a mansion for the duke to reside within. below the surface there is a deep aquifer, which is one of the primary methods of getting water as the black saltstone is crumbly and gets into everything. no agriculture exists on the island, and food has to come from compost vats or be traded for. history[edit] a fellow called diggen discovered the 'rock' as the locals called it, and named it diggen's island, a name used primarily by everyone other than the locals. he left the island soon after naming it and never returned. some point prior to the sorceress' defeat, the king put in place a policy to make it illegal for any citizen of diggen's point to leave the island. this was necessary as the island was quite inhospitable due to the spores, smog, and salt that made living there so unappealing. a cargo inspector would work on the island to ensure no citizen would manage to sneak upon any ships currently docked, and stowaway for a trip off the island. after the sorceress' defeat by tress and the crew of the crow's song, the king issued a new writ alongside the pardons he gave the crew, allowing the citizens of diggen's point to be allowed to leave the island. an incentive to get people to still want to go and stay at the rock was put in place to ensure that everyone did not just leave, as the duke was concerned at first learning the news of what was now allowed for people on his island. a generous payout would be given to anyone who stayed and worked for twenty-years. the payout was good enough that people were coming in droves to get work on the island, and getting a job there was harder than before. culture[edit] economy[edit] the island has plenty of resources in demand from people elsewhere. salt is commonly sought after, especially for its use in making spores inert, in the same way silver does. brick's ale was commonly desired as it is considered some of the best in the region. down and feathers from gulls was also traded for, though all goods require a writ of commission from the king to be sold to any ship docking at the island. alongside money, people would sometimes trade favors, commonly done by the men on the island. they would infer how they had helped others, and word would spread that they needed something from people. this was seen akin to begging for help though, and was not frequently done in this manner unless help was desperately needed. darts[edit] the men that frequent brick's tavern regularly played darts, though with slightly unusual rules. after discovering that with the way the grain in the wood wall looked above the dartboard, it almost looked like an image of the duke. that meant the two knots in the wood below the dartboard could be interpreted as a certain part of the duke, right above where legs would be, and thus were the real target for the game. a good dart throw would result in winces from any witnesses. notable residents[edit] - the notes[edit]"
Ulaam,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ulaam,"ulaam is a kandra on scadrial and later lumar. appearance and personality[edit] being a kandra, ulaam has the ability to dramatically alter his physical form. while aboard the crow's song, he maintains inhumanly sharp features, ashen grey skin, jet-black hair, and blood red eyes; this is similar to a dzhamarian from sel. he dresses in a sharp suit (previously belonging to hoid) of a style tress is unfamiliar with. she finds the pure-black, pressed, buttonless suit more elegant than the uniforms her island's nobility wore. referred to as dr. ulaam, he is highly knowledgeable in medicine as he assumes the role of the ship’s surgeon. hoid even claims that ulaam is the best doctor he’s ever met. ulaam speaks with a refined but excitable voice often adding ""hmmm?"" to his questions. similar to how vendell goes around making deals with people for their bones once they die, ulaam attempts to make offers for organs and limbs such as tress’s eyes, kidney, tongue, brain, hands, and toes. he does not often attempt to mimic humans or other animals, resulting in a completely unique personality, even among others of his kind. ulaam claims to be the least dangerous thing on the ship; after being accused of eating people by ann, he clarifies that he only eats dead ones and compares himself to an earthworm or bacteria. ""“i always say, when trouble troubles you, keep a stiff’s upper lip! or several.”-ulaam"" ulaam has a sarcastic, morbid sense of humor (offering literal hands when giving assistance). his jokes are often perceived as quite gruesome and, though extremely friendly, he lacks empathy and insight. ulaam is heavily cosmere-aware and has an extensive knowledge of the aethers both on this planet and others. he explains to tress the use, mechanics, and history of various spores including midnight essence. ulaam is well liked and respected by his crewmates. he is always willing and enthused to give medical attention, assist with experiments, or engage in friendly bargaining. whether he is physically unable or simply morally opposed, he tells tress that it would be improper to interfere and assist with the crew’s mutiny and that he can only offer medical attention if required. he mentions that he must remain neutral when it comes to certain people like the sorceress. there are supposed rules that he follows but hoid does not. attributes and abilities[edit] like the kandra seen on scadrial, ulaam is functionally immortal and able to manipulate his physical form. he mentions that he has eaten and mimicked several two-headed snakes. he grows and cuts off an ear on his forearm without displaying a hint of any pain. he is nearly impossible to kill and is confident in his abilities to survive being thrown into an ocean of spores. captain crow shoots him several times when he first arrives on the crow's song, which experience he describes as being invigorating. ann calls him a zombie, but ulaam claims that that is a crude and inaccurate term. she defends the word by stating that he has no heartbeat and his skin is cold. in response, ulaam notes that both of those adaptations reduce his caloric intake. potential ways to kill kandra include acid and fire. acting as the ship's surgeon, ulaam administers salves to injured crew members healing their wounds supernaturally quickly. he requests no payments for his services besides occasional corpses. history[edit] ""“oh, right. i nearly forgot ulaam. but seeing as he was dead, he barely counted.”-hoid"" ulaam is a kandra from the planet scadrial. he, alongside tensoon, warned melaan about her relationship with wayne. prior to his time on lumar, his people were ""released"" by sazed. it is noted by hoid that the kandra have become stranger and more themselves over the decades since they stopped being required to imitate humans. at some point, hoid sent ulaam a letter requesting he come to lumar. after arriving on the planet and finding his friend in his current, cursed state; he joined the crow's song and had accompanied hoid for a year before tress's arrival on the ship. the crew hadn't known what to make of ulaam, and crow shot him several times before he was left to his own devices as the resident surgeon on the ship. ulaam met tress after she experienced a mishap with the spores while refilling the pouches for the cannon. ulaam would be unsuccessful in trading tress for her eyes and other body parts, but would make deals with fort for gull bones. he helped tress learn the basics of her station as the new sprouter, and tries to warn her away from midnight spores to no avail. after finding out hoid gave the midnight spores to weev, he helps tress work out that hoid is suggesting huck may have information that will help them break his curse. on hearing crow laugh, and being disappointed that this wasn't due to someone's crotch being impaled, ulaam finds out that tress ""tricked"" crow into going into the crimson sea. he has to explain to her that this is not a good thing as the dragon xisis doesn't offer boons, but trades. ulaam helps test out tress's new flares to capture crow, but insists he cannot do much more to help other than offer medical attention as to do more would be improper. after the failed mutiny, ulaam did as he said he would, and gave medical assistance to fort and salay. ulaam is the first to realize that hoid's actions, throwing food and water overboard, were not of his own doing due to his current mental state. he causes tress further anxiety when he fails to take her concerns of facing the sorceress seriously at first, however he is able to calm her down and lets on about how powerful hoid is after she notices how much he mentions him. he stays happily on the ship when tress goes to face against the sorceress. relationships[edit] hoid[edit] ""“hoid has too many issues to count. i wouldn’t trouble yourself with his situation. he’s nearly as deft at untying knots as he is at creating them.”-ulaam"" ulaam has a previous friendship with hoid. ulaam seems to enjoy witnessing the effects of the sorceress's curse on his friend, going so far as to write embarrassing accounts of his actions and sending them to mutual good friends of theirs. ulaam takes advantage of hoid's misfortunes and excites in the opportunity to explore. though lacking empathy for the man and giving numerous insults, ulaam states on multiple occasions that hoid is far more powerful than himself and is the only person on the planet capable of defeating the sorceress. riina[edit] ulaam also appears to have some history with the sorceress, as she asks after him when meeting tress. their relationship is not an amiable one; the sorceress states that she keeps a vat of acid just for him. notes[edit]"
Pewternaut,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Pewternaut,"""“why do we need warships? the basin is alone on land and on seas. from whom do we need protection? ”-inis julien, quoted in the new ascendancy"" the pewternaut is a class of steel-hulled warships from scadrial. they were developed by lord mayor bastien severington of bilming along with dr. florin malin around 342 pc. they are heavily armored warships with reinforced hulls, electrical rangefinders, and a total armament of sixteen 12-inch naval artillery guns, with a range of 16 miles. they are capable of reaching a top speed of 24 miles an hour. the pewternaut represented a significant technological advancement compared to the clipper ships typically in use around the basin. senator inis julien and other members of a delegation from elendel that were invited to the unveiling of the ships publicly mocked them as unnecessary. this likely contributed to growing anti-elendel sentiment in other cities, some of it incited by lord severington. history[edit] under the covert direction of telsin and the set, bilming continued building up its fleet and developing its weaponry in the following years, supposedly under elendel's control, but in actuality clearly for its own purposes. in 348 pc, telsin used the pewternaut a16 as a backup method of bringing a powerful bomb from bilming to elendel after the original rocket-based system failed to work. using the pewternaut meant that the bomb could not be blocked by train or road closures, the boat was also set on a straight course to elendel, and set up so that if brought off course, the bomb would detonate. despite this, wax and wayne were able to prevent the bomb from properly detonating, at the cost of wayne's life. this also destroyed the ship. trivia[edit] the pewternaut is described as something analogous in nearly every way to the real-life ship sub-class of battleship starting with their namesake, hms dreadnought, which possessed 5 twin 12-inch naval artillery guns at the exact same speed. given the increased weight in naval guns at the same speed, it can be speculated that the first pewternaut(s) were built with less protection. additionally, the most likely layout of the main battery is 2 super-firing turrets forward, 2 aft (rear), and 2 turrets on either side allowing for a hefty broadside of 12 of their 16 guns. notes[edit]"

Dumad,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Dumad,"dumad is a member of the set on scadrial. attributes and abilities[edit] dumad is a hemalurgist with five spikes, five of them granting him the powers of a coinshot, duralumin gnat, pewterarm, leecher and seeker. history[edit] dumad habitually used duralumin-enhanced steelpushes, using the incredible strength added by burning duralumin to compensate for the relative newness of his powers, compared to wax's skill acquired from a lifetime of use. instead of metal vials traditionally used by other allomancers, which could be affected by coinshots and lurchers, he replenished his metals after each usage of duralumin by drinking from an aluminum flask - which even wax thought was a good idea. during the events prior to the set's attempt to destroy elendel with a trellium-harmonium bomb, dumad and his partner getruda attempted several times to defeat wax and wayne. the final attempt was at the end of wax and wayne's assault on the shaw, protecting the rocket which the lawmen had deduced was the delivery method for the bomb. he was specifically trained by the set in order to act as a counter to waxillium ladrian, but was ultimately defeated by wayne after the pair decided to fight each other's doubles, rather than their own. despite wax's warning to stay back from dumad due to his leecher powers, wayne chose to grapple with the man. dumad attempted to capture wayne using a pair of aluminum handcuffs, but only succeeded in clamping one of wayne's wrists. wayne managed to clamp the other end to dumad's wrist. dumad used a duralumin-enhanced steelpush to propel both he and wayne high into the air, but before he could drink from his aluminum flask to burn steel to slow them down, he discovered that wayne had swiped the flask and could only watch helplessly as wayne flung the flask away from them into the mists. the pair slammed into the floor at great speed; dumad was instantly killed, but wayne's stored healing was just barely enough to allow him to get up and walk away, lamenting that they had fallen too fast for dumad to hear his witty remarks. [expand] upon discovering that the rocket was in fact a decoy, and that the real bomb was on a pewternaut already sailing towards elendel, wax and wayne harvested the spikes from dumad and getruda's corpses. wax was able to use the powers gained from dumad's duralumin-giving spike to steelpush directly from the shaw to the sailing pewternaut. notes[edit]"
Kelesina Shores's party,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kelesina_Shores%27_party,"kelesina shores's party is an event in in 342 pc on scadrial. kelesina shores hosted the party in her home in the city of new seran, on the edge of the elendel basin. it is notable for a number of reasons: wax encountered both hoid and khrissalla, he learned more about the activities of mister suit and the set, and he came into possession of both an unkeyed metalmind and an unsealed metalmind. background[edit] while searching for the bands of mourning, the kandra reluur became ""fixated"" on a number of nobles in new seran. reluur believed that several of these nobles, including kelesina shores, had interactions with edwarn ladrian. unfortunately, reluur's notes were not completed before he went insane due to the removal of one of his hemalurgic spikes, so vendell tasked waxillium ladrian with further investigation, starting with kelesina's party. wax took a train to new seran, accompanied by wayne, steris, marasi, and melaan. history[edit] marasi and wayne skipped the party in order to search for clues regarding reluur's fate, while melaan decided to attend in the body of a muscular man. wax was not looking forward to interacting with nobility, but steris had prepared a notebook with information on all known attendees to help guide them. they ran into a beggar named hoid on the way in, who gave wax an unusual coin. they had an unpleasant encounter with a local noble, gave entrone, who directed several thinly-veiled insults at the couple. khrissalla appeared on the dance floor and asks wax several questions about the physics of his allomantic and feruchemical abilities, then quickly vanished. wax then met with an informant, devlin airs, who told him that he had seen other strange coins changing hands and also gave him some tips about the set's activities in dulsing and the anti-elendel sentiment in the outer basin. wax then talked to kelesina shores and spooked her by showing her the unusual coin. kelesina scurried away, but steris created a distraction by forcing herself to vomit all over the table. while steris recovered, wax heard mayor bastien severington of bilming giving a speech denouncing elendel and realized that civil war may have indeed been brewing. he retrieved a gun that steris sneaked into the party and flew to a second floor balcony seeking kelesina. he eventually found her and concealed himself nearby so he could hear her conversing with his uncle edwarn, a high-ranking member of the set also known as mister suit. wax believed that he had enough evidence to convict kelesina, but was not sure about suit. kelesina's terriswoman steward rushed in to inform her that a seeker in kelesina's employ had detected allomancy in the area, and wax came out of hiding. wax was disappointed to see that suit was not present but was instead talking through an advanced communication device. kelesina's steward revealed herself as a brute and attacked wax, then took his gun and killed kelesina with it, hoping to frame him for murder. wax attempted to escape, but he encountered one of the set's kill squads, who were armed with aluminum weapons. wax evaded them, but was caught by the steward; melaan showed up to help and they killed or disabled all of the attackers. wax realized that suit had always planned to have kelesina killed, and retrieved a gold unkeyed metalmind that she had on her person. he also took the communication device, which he planned to send to elendel for inspection. wax later cited the events of the party as an example of steris being helpful, contrary to her position that she was irrelevant to his adventures. attendees[edit] notes[edit]"
Vinebud,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Vinebud,"vinebud is a type of rockbud that can be found in many regions of roshar. description[edit] vinebud plants have an elastic, hollow stem. the stem normally has a cylindrical shape, but it can expand outward to accommodate the plant's retractable leaves, vine-like tendrils, and cone-like flowers. the plant retracts to protect itself from highstorms or nearby motion, and the stem takes on a bubble-like appearance when it stretches to accommodate the leaves and tendrils. unlike common rockbuds, the vinebud appears to permanently root itself to the ground to avoid being blown around by the storms. the leaves and tendrils of the vinebud are longer and more delicate than those of the common rockbud. the tendrils in particular extend far out of the plant and wave in the wind. shallan davar speculated that vinebud is related to fingermoss, a smaller plant with a similar appearance. gardeners on roshar have cultivated a variety of vinebud that does not retract back into its stem, although it retains a vestigial shell. it is used as a houseplant. trivia[edit] - the design for vinebuds was based on the sea anemone. notes[edit]"
Nicelle Sauvage,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Nicki_Savage,"nicelle sauvage, also known as nicki savage is a scadrian noblewoman and detective most famous for her published adventures, originally done under the allomancer jak brand. her adventures are published in the the house record and the new ascendancy. she learns the art of storytelling from jak. like jak, she embellishes her stories. appearance and personality[edit] sauvage is depicted in her publications as being a young woman approximately in her mid-twenties. she is depicted as being quite pale and a natural brunette with curls. she is presented as a fashionable individual, consistently wearing high-quality dresses and sun hats, as well as makeup and custom miele jedon boots. she also wears a satchel. in terms of personality, it appears that nicelle has had a dramatic shift in her outlook during her adventures throughout scadrial. although she explored outreaches of society in 342, she was self-admittedly not very brave, being fearful of even interacting with a strange figure she saw along her travels. upon being discovered by jak and publishing under his brand name, however, it seems that this fearfulness began to leave her slowly, to the extent that she showed little hesitance in charging at nazh in order to prevent him from taking a map she needed for one of her adventures. over the ensuing five years, her interest in exploring the rest of scadrial and the cosmere only grew until finally she was excited at the prospect of exploring it all. attributes and abilities[edit] sauvage is a chromium misting (aka a leecher), granting her the ability to remove investiture from objects so long as she can touch them while burning chromium. she also claims that she was taught under baz-kor monks who trained her on a fighting style that lets her get close enough to use her abilities against an opponent as well as general self-defense techniques. as a child, she was also trained in ballet, something which she claims helps her achieve feats of athleticism in the present time. over time, nicelle also came to learn about the wider cosmere and developed at least a basic understanding of its workings. history[edit] nicelle sauvage was born on an unknown date. she was raised as a noblewoman in new seran and was eventually trained in self-defense under the tutelage of baz-kor monks, as well as ballet. her family eventually came into possession of pinecone allomouser the third, a cat. during this time, it seems nicelle developed a habit of exploring the roughs surrounding the basin. one of her trips eventually took her towards the southern mountains, during which she was separated from her peers. at the time she did not know what their fates were and considered it a real possibility that they had died. while by herself she eventually came upon a clearing in the mountains which contained a pool inside of it. emerging from the pool was a ""dark figure"" whose only discernible features were their eyes. fearful, nicelle abandoned the location and hiked an hour away from the pool before setting up camp. eventually, she managed to return to civilization where she then recalled her story to the local broadsheets. over the following year, tales of her adventures eventually reached the ear of jak and it was agreed for her to start publishing her tales in a serialized nature under his brand name. during this time she was advertised as a paranatural detective by jak. eventually, her father, stefan, passed away and left nicelle an inheritance which included a map of the city. allegedly, this map had a secret pocket which contained instructions on how to discover a tribe of metal beings created by the lord ruler known as the kalkis. before nicelle could retrieve these instructions, however, the map was stolen from her by nazh wearing a mistcloak as a disguise. during the ensuing struggle, nicelle managed to steal one of nazh's devices and pocketed it while nazh himself ran away towards a nearby gondola. nicelle gave chase and managed to jump onto the side of the gondola and cling on just as it departed from its dock. while clinging on, nicelle glanced inside and saw nazh fiddling with a glowing device, one she presumed was to provide his means of escape. panicked, nicelle grabbed hold of the device she stole from nazh and rammed it into the gondola door, causing an explosion, destroying the door and releasing a cognitive shadow. it is unknown if the device nicelle used unleashed the shadow or if nazh shot it at her using his gun like nicelle presumed. if the latter, nazh was not intending to kill her with the shot. with the door now removed, nicelle entered the gondola proper and saw it was littered with a variety of nazh's devices. he pulled a gun of unknown function on her, causing her reflexes to kick in. she approached him swiftly and used her leecher abilities to drain the device of its investiture. upon seeing this, nazh panicked and tried to take aim again, but this time nicelle kicked the gun out of his hand and let it plummet off the gondola. while he was distracted, nicelle grabbed hold of the map. before she could take it, however, nazh grabbed onto his side of it. the pair wrestled for control over it, all the while insulting one another until eventually, nazh fell out of the gondola. nicelle offered a truce to try and pull him up, but nazh declined and opted to cut the map in half, causing him to plummet. after confirming her half of the map had the clue she needed, nicelle travelled down to where nazh should have landed but found no evidence of him there nor any witnesses to him. while searching, she bumped into hoid, who offered to tell her a story which she declined. upon reaching home, she immediately consulted the map for the next clue on her journey. during the six following years, nicelle eventually served as jak's assistant for a brief period, which she would consider one of the strangest times in her life, and then became an independent adventurer again. during these adventures, she allegedly befriended two faceless immortals named kesun and tabaar who later became her travelling companions. together, they went on many adventures, with one involving tabaar having to disguise himself as human in a hero for all ages. she met the haunted man many more times as well throughout her travels, to the extent that nicelle counted him as one of her adventuring companions, and they made a promise with each other to explore the cosmere together. their relationship slowly took on a romantic tension. following a public dispute between jak and his sidekick handerwym, sauvage would decide to continue under handerwym's brand. her newer stories contained comments making fun of jak's stories and she was more open to handerwym editing her work. eventually, nicelle's travels led her to find the compass of spirits, which she believed was central to saving scadrial. the compass possessed the ability to send one to the ghostly dimension. while attempting to reach their destination, one of nicelle's rivals, vila mecant, stole the compass but forgot to take the key with her. nicelle moved to hand the key to the device to nazh so that he could keep it away from vila while nicelle persuaded her two companions to merge together into a bird. with this done, they gave chase to vila and nicelle fought her off, managing to retrieve the compass in the process. afterwards, she spoke to nazh who held her and then moved in for a kiss before stealing the compass from nicelle. he apologized before disappearing to the ghostly dimension. realizing the betrayal, nicelle was hurt and panicked, realizing that there was no way for them to locate nazh, concluding their quest was lost. kesun and tabaar, however, stopped nicelle and told her that there was another way to enter the ghostly dimension that they had never told her about. relationships[edit] nazh[edit] nicelle and nazh originally met when the latter tried to steal a part of her inheritance, a map of new seran given to her by her father. during this altercation, the pair originally fought one another, which ended with nazh dangling out of the gondola they were in. nicelle attempted to reach down and save his life but he rejected the offer. though quite angry with him over the theft of the map, nicelle admitted that she found nazh quite attractive, calling the timbre of his voice enjoyable and stating that she enjoyed remembering his face. ""“you silly man. you'll never get rid of me that easily. it's you and me exploring the cosmere together forever. just like we promised.”-nicelle talking to nazh."" over the following six years, nicelle and nazh's paths crossed frequently with one another, during which their relationship slowly grew less hostile. eventually, nicelle considered him as one of her travelling companions and the pair made a promise to one another to explore the cosmere together. during this time, it appears that their relationship also took on a more obvious romantic tension. unfortunately, their travels ended during the compass of spirits incident where the pair moved to enter the ghostly dimension. upon retrieving the compass, nazh, for reasons unknown, betrayed nicelle by tricking her into thinking they were about to kiss before pickpocketing the compass for himself and entering the ghostly dimension by himself. it appears that he was not happy about this as he apologized to her for doing so. trivia[edit] - nicelle sauvage may be the main character in a future novella by - named ' - .' notes[edit]"
Rian,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rian,"""“you can’t save him. she’s going to kill him. she promised me freedom, but here i am, bound. oh, ruin.”-rian to waxillium ladrian"" rian is one of governor replar innate's guardsmen in elendel on scadrial. appearance and personality[edit] nothing is known of rian's appearance, but he often wears the dark suit and hat that is the uniform of the governor's guards. it is difficult to know what rian's personality is like normally. after bleeder influences his mind, rian appears mad. he mutters and mumbles to himself nonsensically. he also rocks back and forth while sitting or standing and appears to only tangentially understand what is going on around him. he only sometimes looks at people that he is speaking to, and he will randomly break into humming on occasion. it is uncertain if or when rian will ever recover from bleeder's interference with his mind. history[edit] early life[edit] rian was born a common man, he was not part of any noble family. at some point in rian's life, he was hired as one of the governor's guardsmen. he also began a family, and had at least one child, a daughter. while working as a guard, he was spiked by bleeder. it is unknown what type of spike she used, but it is possible that it was made of trellium, like other spikes bleeder used. she was able to use this spike to gain some level of control over rian's actions. bleeder made rian wear fake steelminds, hoping that if rian was arrested, the constables would believe that rian was responsible for the assassination of lord winsting innate. she also inserted a rare coin from waxillium ladrian's past into rian's forearm, with a message for waxillium, in case wax realized that rian was not a true criminal. assassination attempt[edit] after winsting innate was murdered, governor innate gave a speech defending his brother's character. rian was one of the governer's guardsmen present at the event. as the governor began to end his speech, bleeder spoke to him, telling him to shoot the governor. rian began shuffling and turning in place. after grimacing in pain and whispering to himself, rian raised his revolver and took aim at the governor. constable marasi colms was the only one to see rian's actions, but she tackled rian and created a cadmium bubble. this slowed time around rian and her just before rian managed to fire his gun, giving the guards time to rush the governor to safety. the other guardsmen rapidly realized what was happening and apprehended rian despite his struggles. imprisonment[edit] ""“why did you leave, wax?”-bleeder's message to wax on the coin"" rian was brought to a cell designed to hold metalborn in the first octant precinct station, where he was questioned by constable-general claude aradel, captain reddi, lieutenant caberel, and marasi. they had no luck getting rian to talk, all he would do was mumble. reddi and cabarel were in favor of trying to beat a confession out of rian or threatening his daughter, but marasi dissuaded them from those illegal courses of action. soon afterward, waxillium and wayne arrived at the precinct. wax determined that rian's metalminds were fake by trying to push on them. he and wayne questioned to rian briefly and rian admitted that bleeder had made him try to kill the governor, and that she would continue trying. rian told wax about bleeder's message in his forearm and wax cut his arm open to retrieve the coin. marasi and the constables continued to question rian after wax and wayne left, but they learned nothing. they did discover the hemalurgic spike embedded in rian's body. notes[edit]"

Bronze Palace,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Bronze_Palace,"the bronze palace is the seat of the government of azir and the home of the azish emperor, the prime aqasix. location and appearance[edit] the bronze palace is located in azimir, the capital of azir. it lies a short distance away from the grand market in the city centre. the name is derived from the palace's distinctive appearance: everything within, from the plants and rocks to the buildings themselves, has been soulcast into bronze. this even includes trees, which serve a purely decorative purpose. a tall wall encircles the whole palace complex. within, the bronze palace is comprised of a series of rounded, bulbous-looking buildings reminescent of giant rockbuds, coated in metal leaf. many of the buildings are topped by spires and have numerous windows on their upper floors. the main structure is the largest building in the palace and contains, among others, the viziers' chambers, the kitchens, and the prime's living quarters. the areas between the buildings are flat, with roads wide enough for carriages to ride through. there are several different gardens there, including one of soulcast plants and a sculpture garden. the latter serves as a meeting place for important officials to discuss state matters. those officials, as well as visiting diplomats, travel between the various buildings by chull-pulled rickshaws. within the main structure, illumination is provided by gemstone-filled metal lamps and chandeliers. the chambers of the palace are decorated in traditional azish style, with rugs adorned with large patterns covering every surface. the corridors between them are wide and more than fifteen feet tall, with paintings hanging on the walls and blue and red carpets lying on the floors. in contrast, the passage leading directly to the prime's bedroom is quite narrow, to prevent anyone sneaking by. however, there are small ornamental ledges near the ceiling, although they are too narrow to walk on without assistance. the corridors used by the servants are hidden from the palace's representative sections by false walls. a small, narrow outbuilding is located near the entrance to the central structure, containing a long table and a number of couches, which are decorated in patterns of orange and red. it serves as a waiting area for petitioners who are not allowed to meet with the prime directly. history[edit] the date of the bronze palace's construction is unknown. at some point, perhaps during its creation, the palace was soulcast into bronze, as proof of azir's wealth and prosperity. during the year 1173, the palace saw numerous primes assassinated on its grounds by the assassin in white. it was during that time that lift, gawx and the rest of huqin's crew attempted to rob the palace, leading to gawx becoming the new prime aqasix after being killed by nale and subsequently healed by lift. folllowing the arrival of the everstorm, dalinar kholin visited the bronze palace to negotiate with azir's leadership over whether or not the country would join the alliance with urithiru. though he was not allowed to meet with the prime, the essays he brought with him were sufficient to convince the viziers. notes[edit]"
Horneater Oceans,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Horneater_Oceans,"""“is water of life. it is connection to gods. if unkalaki swim in it, sometimes they see place of gods. ”- rock on the horneater oceans"" the horneater oceans are a series of thermal hot springs in the horneater peaks on roshar. they are sometimes called the emerald pools for their distinct color. they house cultivation's perpendicularity. most high mountains in the horneater peaks have a crater filled with water at their top. this water is hot, providing pockets of livable space around each ocean. the temperature drops drastically at a short distance from the lakes, however, making survival in the peaks without them all but impossible. myths and traditions[edit] according to one story, the horneater oceans were created when the unkalaki people sought to find a place to live where they wouldn't be hunted down. the tana'kai, the leader of the unkalaki, asked the gods of the sea and of the forests to hide them, but they could not help as they, too, were being attacked by men. when the tana'kai asked the same of the gods of the mountains, they told him that helping his people was impossible for them, as their slopes were uninhabitable, but if the unkalaki could find a way to make them livable, the gods would agree. and so, the unkalaki begged the gods of the sea for water to drink, the gods of the forest for the fruit to eat, and the gods of the mountains for the heat of their heart, thus creating the oceans. as the oceans serve as cultivation's perpendicularity, the shard was certainly one of the ""gods"" that the tana'kai asked for aid, but it is unclear whether the other two are just extrapolations of myth or were actually honor and odium. in the modern day, the unkalaki believe that swimming in the oceans is death to any non-unkalaki. some outsiders believe that this is because any foreigners are executed for making an attempt. however, there are also other, more mysterious reasons, some of which may be related to such foreigners disappearing as a result of traveling through the perpendicularity. on the other hand, the unkalaki are free to swim in the oceans, and doing so may sometimes allow them to see the ""place of gods"" and commune with its inhabitants. this most likely also refers to the oceans' nature as a perpendicularity. according to the unkalaki, gods sometimes visit them through the oceans. one of those is lunu'anaki, the god of travel and mischief, who cannot hurt humans and has white hair and an angular face; this description fits hoid. he is, however, far from the only visitor: all worldhoppers are treated like gods by the people of the peaks. perpendicularity[edit] though on top, the oceans are water, beneath that layer there is a different, though still liquid substance that is emerald in color. this marks the oceans as the perpendicularity of the shard cultivation, allowing worldhoppers to travel between roshar and shadesmar. it's the only stable perpendicularity on roshar; for worldhoppers travelling there, the horneater oceans are the place where they emerge into the physical realm. however, during the true desolation, the area in shadesmar surrounding it has been overtaken by the fused, and many spren ships travelling there are never seen again. at the moment, most spren refuse to sail in that direction, and even in the physical realm, the presence of the fused can be felt by the people living around the oceans. notes[edit]"
Vo,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Vo,"vo, also known as the first returned, is the first person known to have returned on nalthis. attributes and abilities[edit] vo presumably had all of the abilities of the fifth heightening granted by a divine breath, including perfect pitch, life sense, and agelessness. unusually for a returned, vo was able to bear children through an unknown method that required specific knowledge. vo is also said to have spoken the five visions that are the founding tenets of austrism. very little is known about austre other than the fact that he is not endowment, and it is therefore unclear if he somehow influenced vo's visions. history[edit] vo was a member of the chedesh people that dominated ancient nalthis. around three hundred years prior to the manywar, the chedesh sent expeditions west across the inner sea in search of new lands. vo was a member of an expedition that discovered a paradise-like valley with numerous unusual properties, including the only known habitat of tears of edgli. unbeknown to the chedesh, the jungles of this valley held endowment's perpendicularity. vo died under unknown circumstances around the same time the valley was discovered, and was soon reborn in the bay adjacent to modern-day t'telir. endowment chose to give him a divine breath hoping that he would fulfill some sort of unknown purpose. vo was presumably an adult when he died; although he only lived for a week after returning, he spoke the five visions and impregnated his wife in that time.[fn 1] the circumstances of his death are unknown, but he likely lived seven days before his body consumed its divine breath on the eighth day. legacy[edit] after vo's second death, his shipmates founded the kingdom of hanald in the valley (despite the fact that the pahn kahl were already inhabiting the area). the new nation chose vo's wife to be their queen. she would go on to establish a royal line, bearing the blood of vo, which would continue to be in power until the manywar. the war resulted in vo's royal line leaving t'telir to establish the nation of idris in the highlands, while hanald was renamed hallandren and the priests there began downplaying the importance of vo's bloodline. his descendants that have a potential claim to the throne have the royal locks, although this is linked to lineage rather than genetics. according to vasher, the royal locks do indicate a relationship to a returned, although he does not specify them as originating from vo. returned are normally unable to bear children despite many attempts to do so over the centuries, and the method by which vo was able to circumvent this limitation is unknown. the story of vo fathering a child has become part of local legend, and siri assumes that it was fabricated in order to legitimize the royal line of hallandren. however, any returned can technically bear children if certain steps are taken; it is unclear if vo figured this out on his own or if he was somehow provided with this knowledge. the modern hallandren priesthood of the god king is aware of a method to allow returned to have children, but it does not always work. they are not sure if it the same method used by vo. at least some priests who know of hallandren's history remain aware that the idrian royals are vo's descendants, but they keep this belief secret. vo's lineage creates something of an inconsistency within the hallandren religion of the iridescent tones since all returned are revered, yet vo's entire bloodline was exiled. vo is typically referred to by his title as ""first returned"" within hallandren, but his name is used in idris. the five visions of vo remain core tenets of austrism hundreds of years after his death. austrism retains many positive qualities, but some of its followers have taken the concept of humility too far, ironically taking pride in being humble. this has led to bias and xenophobia. notes[edit]"
MeLaan,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Melaan,"""“""here's a tip, kid. save the wisecracks until your foe is dead. like this. see how easy it is?"" she kicked the corpse in the face. ”-melaan"" melaan is a kandra of the seventh generation. appearance and personality[edit] ""“thy snoring is rather loud. it doth be like unto a hundred angry koloss in the middle of a rockslide. lo, and it doth come near to waking the dead. ”-melaan to claude aradel"" pre catacendre[edit] melaan is the only kandra raised by tensoon and is considered his adopted daughter/little sister. she has a hero-worship crush on him, inspired by his gruffness and his adventurousness, which makes tensoon somewhat uncomfortable. melaan wears a willowy true body made of wood. its form is unnatural and exaggerated, as are many of the true bodies of her generation. post catacendre[edit] melaan often takes the form of a very tall (several inches taller than the notably tall waxillium) and very busty woman named milan. this true body is made of a green crystal. however, she also has several others, including one that is ostensibly designed for combat. the skeleton underneath is revealed to be made entirely of aluminum, with many useful implements hidden inside including a reinforced compartment for storage of the part of her that stores her consciousness, needles for stitching wounds, and a set of picks for opening locks. this metal body is very durable (a feruchemist brute punched her in the face and her hand essentially exploded). at some point after the events involving the bands of mourning and the discovery of the south scadrians, she began to favor a more androgynous form. this form is taller than even wax; has short, blonde hair; and little hint of breasts. when with friends she keeps a relatively similar face, albeit less overtly feminine. she is sometimes seen wearing stylish blue trousers and a buttoned shirt in this form. her favorite true body is emerald. she occasionally changes her body out of her own will, and does not appear to care about the sex or gender she presents herself as, given how lightly she takes the idea of going to kelesina shores's party as a man. although this seems to have changed to an extent over the years, as she eventually came to prefer a far more androgynous form. notably, her personality is much more free spirited than most kandra, and she gets along very well with wayne, engaging in belching contests on occasion. she is also more lax about following the first contract than other kandra, and is willing to kill humans if she has to. attributes and abilities[edit] as a kandra, she possesses the ability to shapeshift into various different forms around her true body. she is also an immortal being, able to live for centuries, and survive wounds that would be fatal to most biological entities, she is also capable of turning off her pain receptors. she is capable of reforming her body to unlock simple locks. she can make her flesh go transparent in order to reveal her true body. she has various true bodies made out of various materials, such as emerald and aluminum. she sometimes uses ones with hidden weapons, such as swords in her arms. she can also store guns in her body, which she can pull out at will. unlike most kandra, she doesn't necessarily follow the first contract, and thus has little qualms about killing. as a kandra, she has unknown hemalurgic blessings which grant her powers, form, and sapience. if these spikes are removed, she reverts back to her mistwraith state, returning these to her would return her back to her kandra state. she is a worldhopper, and thus knows how to use shadesmar to pass between worlds. history[edit] ""“life then was like life now, only you have better street food. ”-melaan"" the final empire[edit] before becoming a kandra, she existed as a mistwraith for an unknown amount of time. but in the seventh century of the lord ruler's reign, she was granted form and sapience by hemalurgic spikes, becoming a kandra of the seventh generation. tensoon was appointed as her ""parent"", and tasked with raising her as she developed. melaan attended tensoon's judgement trial. after he was publicly imprisoned, she approached him and offered to help him escape. she also offered to retrieve the blessing of potency he took from oreseur. she believed his claim that vin was the lord ruler's heir, and that the kandra's first contract had been transferred to her. she took the changes in the outside world -- the mists that remained during the day and constant ashfall -- as signs and proof. when tensoon refused to rebel against the first and second generations, she accused him of abandoning his people. she was present at his sentencing, after which he escaped. after kanpaar revolted against the first generation and imprisoned sazed, tensoon returned to the kandra homeland. he found that sazed had been taken prisoner with the help of melaan. melaan then fetched the keys and released the first generation, as well as securing bones for them to inhabit. post catacendre[edit] following the catacendre, her loyalty shifted to harmony, as she began to follow his orders and act as his hands in the world. it is not known what she did over the majority of the over three centuries between the catacendre and her interactions with wax and wayne. melaan was the kandra who gave waxillium ladrian his earring; a hemalurgic spike to let harmony communicate with him, so that he could eventually come to act as harmony's sword. paalm's madness[edit] melaan once again met wax at lady zobell's party. she introduced herself as milan, a slight mispronunciation of her real name. after seeming to flirt with wax, she walked away. after the party, she saved wax from the set agents who had ambushed him. she revealed that she was a kandra sent by harmony to help him. later, she met wax, wayne, and marasi at a tavern. she went on to help them on their quest to defeat bleeder. melaan impersonated one of governor replar innate's guards and saved wax from bleeder after the rogue kandra revealed herself. with bleeder unmasked and on the run, melaan attempted to impersonate governor innate in her stead with the intent of placating the angry crowed. while the crowd believed the ruse, melaan's natural inclinations to mimicry moved her away from the speech that marasi planed and she ended up inflaming the crowd instead of calming the people down. before a riot could break out, aradel intervened. he arrested melaan and gained the support of the gathered citizenry by promising them justice. melaan did not know about the true identity of bleeder and was told only afterward. however she firmly believed that harmony had done the right thing in not informing wax of the true identity of his antagonist. after the defeat of bleeder she continued to impersonate governor innate, ""hanging"" herself in her cell so that she did not have to falsely testify in a court of law. search for reluur[edit] melaan agreed to accompany wax, marasi, wayne and steris on their mission to new seran in the hope of curing reluur's insanity by restoring his spike. reluur was injured looking into myths about the bands of mourning. wax couldn’t find melaan during the fight, and later found her topless with wayne in a compartment. when the group arrived in the city melaan shocked several of them by turning into a man, indicating that she was comfortable as either sex. melaan aided wax and steris at kelesina shores's ball, helping wax escape from the scene after he was framed for kelesina's murder. after escaping, she traveled with the party to the crashed brunstell, where she and marasi found reluur's spike and liberated allik neverfar. together the three of them reconvened with wax and wayne and escape on one of the brunstell's ships called wilg. after marasi was injured in the escape, melaan was able to graft a piece of marasi's own flesh onto the wound to heal her. after retrieving steris, they went to the second site to retrieve the bands of mourning. melaan's invulnerability proved critical in reaching the temple where they were supposedly stored, as she was able to survive the damage of the many traps the sovereign had left behind. however she was immobilized by telsin on reaching the temple and losing her spikes, reverting to a mistwraith. after the battle for the bands, melaan's spikes were returned by wayne, and her sentience was restored. the bands were left in her keeping to keep them from being used for political purposes or conquest. worldhopping[edit] after the events involving the bands of mourning, she began her relationship with wayne in earnest, but had to be called away on missions by harmony, sometimes disappearing for months at a time. at some point during this period, she began to favor a more androgynous form. six years later, harmony gave her a mission of going to other worlds in the cosmere to help deal with the rising threat of trell. before she left, she broke up with wayne. while in the cognitive realm, she met with a sho del named jan ven, who ferried her across the interplanetary sea. at some point during this boat ride, nineteen months after the detonation of the set's harmonium bomb, she received a message from harmony about wayne's death, shortly before arriving on the shores of a currently unknown planet. relationships[edit] tensoon[edit] tensoon essentially raised melaan, and she is roughly considered to be his daughter or little sister. as a result of his gruffness and

the catacendre, with melaan noting he would be proud of she can still adopt difficult accents and asking wax not to tell tensoon that she had to kill people again, as kandra killing people upsets him. vendell[edit] vendell considers melaan to be his sister, and cares for her, though he wishes that she would act with more tact. they tend to make witty comments back and forth between each other. wayne[edit] she is in a close relationship with wayne, with him being attracted to her easy-going manner and free spirit, and her admiring his skill in accents and disguises, considering him ""wasted as a human."" after the events in the south, she began a romantic relationship with him, despite the warnings from her fellow kandra about how differently humans experience time. the relationship wasn't as meaningful to her as it was to him, due to differences in how they experienced the passing of time, but she still treasured her time with him, and greatly mourned his death. she thought of it as a mere fling at first, but it was far more to her, as he made her forget what she was and made her forget what was the smart thing to do. six years into their relationship, melaan breaks up with wayne because she has a mission from harmony, and if she stayed it wouldn’t be because she wanted to but because she didn’t want to hurt him. their relationship is sexual in nature, she claims that he gave her the best sex she's known. they are known to have engaged in bondage. this has been confirmed as the honest truth, but that she lived a sheltered life so didn't have much to compare it to.

Mist,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Mists,"mist is a term used to refer to a phenomenon in the world of scadrial. while it does resemble ordinary mist, it exhibits many unusual properties. composition[edit] the mist is a gaseous manifestation of preservation's power similar to both the liquid in the well of ascension and the beads of lerasium. the mist is far less dense than preservation's liquid form, and as such is more limited in what can be done with it. where preservation's liquid form can be used to do great things, from moving planets to changing or creating living creatures, the mist seems to only be able to function incidentally as fuel for allomancy, albeit unusually powerful fuel. characteristics & attributes[edit] pre-catacendre[edit] the mists were originally set up as a method to create mistings by leras via the mist spirit. this spirit takes people that fall well below the level needed for the physical or emotional pain to be able to snap them, and then creates a trauma while raising their level of preservation in their body. this process could be fatal to the person snapped depending on many factors, one of which is what type of allomancy the person is getting. some have only a little trauma, and others have debilitating trauma inflicted on them that requires weeks of bed rest. the elderly and young are more susceptible to death during this process. the mist reacts to any allomancer by swirling around them so long as they are not pierced by a hemalurgic spike. any allomancer with a spike will slightly repulse the mists as if they were pushing it away from them. ruin's power is sometimes seen as a black mist where preservation's is a white mist. this manifestation of ruin's power is only seen at the well of ascension and after ati's death before sazed picked up both shards. after the catacendre[edit] after harmony's ascension, more than one type of mist began appearing: a darker mist representing ruin and a lighter mist representing preservation. they are capable of powering both allomancy and feruchemy. additionally, they stopped pulling away from hemalurgy until sometime between 341 and 348 pc. they will also stay far away from an avatar of autonomy. the mist that obscures the night can be partially pierced by an allomancer burning tin to reveal the stars above. a tin savant can even pierce them to the point that they are virtually gone to their sight. the mists can also distort sounds. the mists will not enter any building and even a simple tent is enough to keep them out. in special circumstances some allomancers can and have drawn on the mists for power, using them as fuel for allomancy even after their ingested metals have all been burned. this use of the mists allows for greater power when using allomancy to the point that a person can even push on metals piercing someone's skin. harmony can also use the mists to give a greater effect than they might otherwise have. this can even be used to give boost of strength and calmness. the mists can be captured in a polestone. the mist would push away from nightblood. history[edit] classical scadrial[edit] the mists are the basis for the phenomenon known as the deepness during pre-ascension times that the lord ruler defeated. before the events that led to alendi heading to the well of ascension, the mist via the mist spirit snapped people to create mistings. at this time no mistborn existed as the level of preservation in each person was too low. the final empire[edit] the mists during the lord ruler's reign appeared every night, providing a dense fog that obscured everything. they acted in a different fashion than normal fog and never appeared during the daytime. the mists would disperse soon after entering a structure or tent wafting in with misty tendrils then dissipating. the skaa, fearing the mists and the mistwraiths, stayed indoors at night time and only went out into the mist when absolutely necessary. nobles, however, did not have the same pathological fear of the mists and even named their most powerful warriors after it, although the title mistborn may be something the lord ruler gave them because he knew the true nature of the mist and lerasium. the mists during this time did not seem to snap people; however, most noblemen would have been snapped as a child and skaa always hid from the mists. skaa that did go out in the mist and were snapped could have very easily justified skaa fears of the mist, preventing more snapping from occurring. additionally, a skaa misting may have never known of his powers, or if he did find out, he may have chosen to hide the fact, since being a misting meant death for skaa in the final empire. the mists changed the moment the full power of the well returned to be drawn again and started to snap people. after the final ascension[edit] after sazed picked up both shards, becoming harmony, more than one type of mist began appearing, and the mists no longer obscured the land every night. there are now two types of mists: a darker mist representing ruin and a lighter mist representing preservation. the mists appear to have become a more localized phenomenon, only covering a section of land each night instead of the whole land. the mists no longer snap people as they once did, and it is unknown how this is done now. due to the fact that harmony disliked how snapping worked before, it now functions differently. coinshots have started calling the nightscape above the mists the ascendant's fields. it is only accessible to coinshots as they can push themselves into the sky. notes[edit]"

Hazekiller,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kill_squad,"hazekillers are specialized warriors on scadrial who are trained to fight and kill allomancers. after the catacendre, the term hazekiller is rarely heard, but ""kill squad"" is used as a rough synonym. ranette also invents specialized bullets used to fight allomancers that she names ""hazekiller rounds"". final empire[edit] during the final empire, hazekillers were ordinary people trained to fight and kill mistings and mistborn. wealthy noble houses such as house venture employed squads of hazekillers in addition to their regular security forces in order to defend their keeps against allomancers. hazekillers were also used as guards to prevent entry or escape by allomancers. hazekillers typically wore no armor, and they carried no metal. they used non-metallic weapons such as dueling canes, staves, or obsidian blades. they had special training in recognizing the effects of the metallic arts and were not easily deceived by allomancy. they often utilized large wooden shields that could be used to deflect coins or other projectiles. they worked in large groups using aggressive tactics to overwhelm enemy allomancers. alternatively, they could try to stall until help from friendly allomancers arrived. because mistborn had a wide range of abilities, they were particularly difficult for hazekillers to contain; highly skilled mistborn such as kelsier, zane, and vin successfully fought large groups of hazekillers. post-catacendre[edit] after the catacendre, the term ""hazekiller"" was considered to be archaic, and it was not in common use. however, people that used hazekiller tactics still existed and were sometimes referred to as ""kill squads""; wayne directly equated these kill squads to the hazekillers of old. kill squads received some training in recognizing the effects of temporal allomancers such as sliders, which did not exist in the final empire. granite joe sent a kill squad that carried no metal and used crossbows after wax in weathering. the set also employed multiple kill squads, and sometimes even outfitted them with expensive aluminum weapons and bullets. the set was also prone to including allomancers or feruchemists in their kill squads. hazekiller rounds[edit] ranette paid homage to hazekillers by making special bullets intended to dispatch each type of misting and naming them ""hazekiller rounds"". these included: - coinshot: rounds with a ceramic tip that keeps travelling after the metal of the bullet has been pushed away. - lurcher: rounds with ceramic sides that explode when pulled on, causing shrapnel, which is said to be harmful but not lethal. - tineye: rounds that make a loud noise when fired and a different noise when they hit. they are intended to disable rather than harm. - pewterarm: rounds that are larger and packed with more gunpowder. they are intended to overpower the resilience of a pewterarm until death. ranette believed that her hazekiller rounds were even more effective than aluminum bullets against allomancers, because they would not realize the danger of her rounds until it was too late. vindication, the specialized revolver that ranette gave to wax, was able to fire both standard bullets and hazekiller rounds. see also[edit] notes[edit]"

Jackstom Harms,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Jackstom_Harms,"jackstom harms is the head of house harms and a member of the elendel nobility on scadrial. appearance and personality[edit] ""“this is our lot, son. to be lord of a house requires certain sacrifices.”-lord harms to waxillium"" lord harms is a rather fat man with long mustaches that hang down to his neck. he wears very expensive suits and often carries a mahogany cane that is a harms family heirloom. lord harms is in the habit of daubing at his face with a handkerchief when in high stress situations. on the surface, lord harms is the very portrait of propriety. the man is dutiful, punctual to a fault, well-dressed, and lord of a wealthy, if less-influential, house. however, beneath the surface he is quite different. lord harms can be rude on occasion and is willing to force his way into rooms if he is left waiting too long. he also has a somewhat off-color sense of humor and will sometimes needle his daughter steris until she is enraged. lord harms at one point had an affair, which resulted in the birth of marasi. despite his indiscretions, lord harms often acts superior and condescending towards others, particularly towards waxillium ladrian, who he feels needs a strong hand to keep him on the right path. when a situation becomes dire however, this arrogant facade cracks and all his bravado vanishes, leaving him desperate and helpless. it seems that despite his apparent flaws, lord harms is a competent lord to his house. house harms is in an excellent situation financially. however, they lack high-level social connections and a male heir. history[edit] ""“i care nothing for the money or jewelry they took from me. it can be replaced, and most of it was insured anyway. but i’ll pay any price for steris. please. she is to be your fiancée! you have to find her!”-lord harms to waxillium"" early life[edit] very little is known about lord harms' early life. at some point during his youth, he was married to a woman with a rather harsh and cold personality -- likely a political marriage. his wife gave birth to a daughter, steris. at some point during lord harms' marriage, he had an affair with another woman. that woman ultimately became pregnant and gave birth to marasi, lord harms' second daughter. embarrassed to have an illegitimate daughter, he had her sent to a cousin house, where she was raised as marasi colms. although not raised by lord harms, she was fully aware that he was her father and spent much time with him, as well as her half-sister, steris. when it became apparent that marasi was a pulser, lord harms insisted that she keep the ability quiet. he claimed that being an allomancer was unseemly, but in truth he did not want marasi to appear as a better marriage prospect than steris. despite his generally poor treatment of marasi, lord harms still paid for her education at elendel university and allowed her to stay in his home while she studied he claimed to be doing it out of charity, for her parents could not afford the cost. at an unknown point, lord harms' wife passed away. dealings with house ladrian[edit] several months after his return from the roughs, high lord waxillium ladrian approached lord harms about the possibility of marriage to his daughter steris. since three other attempts to marry steris off had been unsuccessful, lord harms jumped at the opportunity to join his house to such a prestigious house as house ladrian. after a few months and several letters and conversations, lord harms felt prepared to allow wax to begin courting steris. he and steris met wax, as well as wayne in the guise of wax's fictional uncle maksil, at ladrian mansion to discuss the potential betrothal. he also brought marasi, who had insisted on accompanying them in order to meet her hero, wax. despite some misgivings about wax's past as a lawman, the conversation proved fruitful and lord harms agreed that wax and steris should start courting with the eventual intention of marriage. the two decided that they would begin their courtship at the yomen-ostlin wedding dinner. while attending the wedding dinner, lord harms sat at a table with wax, steris, and marasi. they conversed about wax's time as a lawman and marasi's studies at the university, although lord harms attempted to keep marasi quiet. eventually, the conversation grew too inappropriate and angered steris, who left. lord harms blamed marasi and wax, although he admitted that he too was often tempted to annoy steris. he sighted his friend, lord alernath, at the bar and left the table to join him. when the vanishers entered the room, lord harms was still seated at the bar and was too far away to do anything when marasi and steris were kidnapped. after the firefight in which wax and wayne managed to rescue marasi but not steris, lord harms seemed stunned by steris' kidnapping. he was terrified for her and begged wax to find her, totally abandoning his previously condescending attitude towards wax. he then left the party to sit in his carriage until marasi wanted to leave so he could have some time to think for himself. the next day, lord harms agreed to finance wax's efforts to find her, including the cost of the equipment wax had purchased to analyze the aluminum alloy in the vanishers' equipment, as house ladrian was lacking in liquid assets. relationship with daughters[edit] lord harms has a rather interesting relationship with his daughters. steris is very similar in temperament to lord harms' late wife, who it is implied he never truly loved. this often tempts lord harms to bother her more than he should, although he usually regrets it later, as steris has him quite firmly under her control. however, he truly loves steris, despite being baffled by her idiosyncrasies and bluntness. when she is captured by the vanishers, lord harms is prepared to do whatever he can to see her safe. he has also impacted steris' view of marriage; she considers extramarital affairs to be typical. his relationship with marasi however, is far less positive. years after her birth, lord harms still treats her as an embarrassment that needs to be covered up and placed well out of sight, even around those unaware that she is his daughter. lord harms is dismissive towards marasi, sometimes to the point of foolishness. he actively seeks to keep her quiet about her interests and studies at the university. lord harms also insists that marasi keep her powers and her parentage a secret. there is a bitterness to their relationship that cannot be ignored. notes[edit]"

he wanted to make sure she was well and asked her to come back. he was contacted by dalinar who wanted to meet him, using the oathgate and discuss the unification of roshar. yanagawn, and his group of advisors, denied him the request and implied the oathgate was broken, which was not entirely true. they did extend their gratitude for the timely information given on the everstorm and gave information on the awakened parshmen who didn’t attack but exchanged contracts with them. dalinar’s visions[edit] dalinar via the stormfather brought yanagawn to the aharietiam vision and made sure he felt some challenge and stress. with dalinar’s as archer, they defended the lines until the radiant climbed up over the edge of the cliff, glowing in shardplate. emperor yanagawn sat down as the other soldiers rallied around the radiant and pushed the enemy back. he was terrified but eventually stood up and walked the other way. he started chatting with people on the vision, asking them who they were and why they fought. they didn’t give many answers, but later came jezerezeh’elin himself, herald of kings announcing the victory over the voidbringers. yanagawn recognized him, to what dalinar got close to him and introduced himself. yanagawn considered dalinar his enemy. it is clear the young prime learned history and was very concerned about dalinar being alethi, who still worshiped sunmaker´s rule, to what dalinar acknowledged youth of brutality but the advantage of seeing the consequences of his actions. just as they were getting closer, lift appeared and explained she did not trust him either and both left the vision leaving dalinar by himself. it is implied that yanagawn visited other visions without changing his mind until he visited the recreance. this vision had shaken him and he showed dalinar a more insecure part of himself, he was open about his lack of readiness to be a ruler. he also confessed that he didn’t change his mind because lift didn’t trust him because he was too righteous, which meant he was hiding something. he disappeared as the vision ended. unification of roshar[edit] though yanagawn left the recreance vision, it didn’t end for dalinar who faced odium. what they didn’t expect was for lift to be there. this experience made her change her mind and convinced yanagawn to receive dalinar at azir's capital azimir. dalinar went there and gave the prime and his viziers three essays to which they responded positively (especially to the one from navani) and accepted the invite to urithiru. the young azish prime was the first one to arrive. he did with his very ornate throne. he was accompanied by three representatives of kingdoms subject to azir: the prime of emul, the princess of yezier, and the ambassador from tashikk. all brought chairs that were faintly inferior to that of the azish prime. this was not to embarrass the prime, but confirm they were not his subjects. during the meeting, the prime supported his representatives in gaining territory and voiced concerns about the new power dalinar and the new radiants now held. he also challenged the rightfulness of the lost radiants' motives for abandoning their oaths. however, after being given the task of creating a code of how kingdoms are to interact and share resources, they supported the unification and offered to send five battalions to jah keved and support a possible invasion from the enemy. the azish did mobilize troops, but after taravangian´s treason and the unification fracture, they retired from urithiru and the war. on their way back to azimir, yanagawn wanted to turn back and help the alethi as he trusted lift who still trusted dalinar. they did find out amaram and his troops turned sides and he leaves thinking the alethi betrayed thaylen and that he and lift had been wrong in trusting them. coalition of monarchs[edit] alongside dalinar kholin, queen jasnah kholin, king taravangian, and queen fen, yanagawn authorized the expedition to lasting integrity, the capital city of the honorspren, and military intervention to retake in emul. relationships[edit] lift[edit] lift and yanagawn care for each other, as shown by his genuine happiness when she returns from yeddaw. he trusts her, acknowledging that she is smart. they first meet as thieves stealing from the azish prime's palace; when he is mortally wounded by nale´s companion, she cares enough for him that she speaks the second ideal and uses regrowth to save him. in consideration of this apparent miracle, he is appointed prime of azir and in return, he saves lift by pardoning her and stopping nale from executing her. lift is protective of him and accompanies him to important events such as his meetings with dalinar kholin in his visions and the coalition's meetings at urithiru. after the battle in emul, yanagawn asks about lift, who has been in urithiru enduring the fused occupation. despite news that most of the radiants are unconscious, he comments, “she often does what she isn’t supposed to."" dalinar[edit] yanagawn’s trust in dalinar is strongly influenced by lift. as her opinion of dalinar evolves, so does his. still, there are times during the visions when he opens up to dalinar and shows his fears about his leadership. when he and his advisors leave the thaylens and the alethi to defend thaylen city, he tells noura that he learned from lift that it is wrong to betray a friend;

Claude Aradel,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Aradel,"claude aradel is the former governor of elendel on scadrial, preceded by replar innate and followed by varlance. he previously served as a constable in elendel, attaining the rank of constable-general. appearance and personality[edit] he is an older man, probably in his late sixties, though his true age is unknown. he has leathery skin, and shaves when the mood strikes him. he was an enthusiastic constable. he often left his administrative duties to languish while he personally ran investigations and day-to-day operations. history[edit] aradel was a constable in elendel. he worked up to the rank of constable-general of the fourth octant, where he retired after reaching the silent glass ceiling of promotions a non-noble could receive. after the resignation of constable-general brettin, aradel came out of retirement to accept the position. he hired marasi colms as a constable. she served him as an assistant and crime analyst. he headed the investigation into the massacre at winsting innate's auction. he brought waxillium ladrian into the investigation. the kandra paalm was developed as a suspect. the actions of paalm put elendel into a state of near-revolution. to quell riots replar innate issued an executive order declaring a state of martial law and naming aradel lord high constable. after the discovery that innate had been replaced by paalm, marasi arranged to have melaan replace innate for the purpose of quelling the crowd. when melaan began to fail, aradel placed the innate imposter under arrest for corruption. he quelled the crowd by promising to arrest other corrupt nobles. after the downfall and death of innate, aradel became governor. he is the first non-noble leader since before the time of the lord ruler. sometime in the year 346 pc, he stepped down as governor and was replaced by varlance. trivia[edit] - he is a descendant of - . - his snoring is extremely loud. notes[edit]"
First Contract,https://coppermind.net/wiki/First_Contract,"the first contract is the legal code of the kandra, created by the first generation and ratified by the lord ruler. it also serves as a set of instruction to be followed if ruin escaped his prison. applications of the first contract[edit] the first contract bound the kandra in servitude to the lord ruler, whom they called the father. it is presented to each generation, upon their awakening, and is the first information they learn. based on the first contract, lesser service contracts can be created with humans wishing to hire kandra to perform services. in addition to being a legal code, the first contract was created to be a set of instructions to be enacted at the time ruin returned to the world and it began to end. over the centuries, the meaning behind the first contract has faded to become abstract and philosophical, due to fear from the later generations about what was being asked of them. the physical metal sheet that it is written on is treated with less reverence by the first generation than the other kandra. contents[edit] included in the first contract are clauses that encompass the following ideas, although the wording is unknown; - ultimate dedication to the lord ruler - the ultimate duty of the kandra in safeguarding atium - reverence for earlier generations - legal rights of all kandra, including the right to plead ones case to the first generation before execution. - provisions for the creation of new kandra - prohibition of the murder of humans, but not kandra - the resolution in addition to the above, the first contract contains some level of information, predicted by the lord ruler, about the return of ruin and the disappearance of the mists. during this time, the kandra were to seek out the lord ruler in person to serve him. although not explicitly stated, this event would likely trigger enactment of the resolution. kandra that break the first contract can be sentenced by the first generation. murder of a human is punishable by death. resolution[edit] the resolution was a stipulation added to the first contract by the lord ruler. if enacted, the kandra are to remove their blessings to prevent ruin from taking control of their bodies. this would cause the kandra to lose sapience and change back into mistwraiths. all kandra are told of the resolution upon birth and have this duty ingrained in them throughout their lifetime. the resolution has only been enacted once since the creation of the kandra, though not all kandra were there, so not all kandra removed their blessings. history[edit] when tensoon was held captive after returning to the kandra homeland, he eventually has the chance to defend his case before the first generation of kandra (the lord rulers old friends). his defense of revealing the kandra secret is that he was simply following the first contract. when the first generation scoffed, he explained that seeing as vin had been the one to kill the lord ruler, who all kandra were loyal to under the first contract, the first contract had, in a way, been transferred to her. he justifies his actions by stating that he had been giving allegiance to vin by showing her the kandra's closely guarded secrets. it seems like no one will believe him, and the first generation does not consider it a valid defense, so they decide he is guilty and send him to his ""cage"" to await a sufficient punishment. creation[edit] the first contract started as a series of promises made by the lord ruler to the first generation, which evolved into the legal code of the species. once written, the kandra took their proposed code to the lord ruler to request his approval, as they did not wish for independent governance. the document was cast into steel, as commanded by the lord ruler, and ratified with his signature. by recording their laws in metal, the kandra could be certain their legal codes could not be altered by ruin and would remain immortalized throughout the passing centuries. 1022-1024[edit] after the death of the lord ruler, the validity of the first contract came into question as no provision had been included about how to proceed in the event of rashek's death. tensoon, proclaimed vin to be the inheritor of the contract, as she had been the one to defeat the lord ruler. however, he was unsuccessful in convincing the other kandra that this was true. the year after ruin's release, the first generation triggered the first contract clause known as the resolution, ordering all kandra to remove their blessings to prevent manipulation by ruin. during this time, only some of the kandra upheld the oath they took upon waking, returning to their prior states as mistwraiths. following the battle of hathsin, the blessings were returned to each kandra to return their sapience. following the catacendre[edit] at least some kandra continue to follow the first contract after the catacendre, though not always to the letter of the law. notes[edit]"
Iron,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Blessing_of_Potency,"iron is the external physical pulling metal. an allomancer burning iron can pull bits of metal toward their ""center of self,"" and can also use iron to sense the presence of metal nearby. ironpulling is not dependent on magnetic forces or allomantic power--most metals (with the exception of aluminum and some of its alloys) can be pulled. feruchemists can use iron to store physical weight, and when used as a hemalurgic spike, iron steals physical strength. the paired alloy of iron used in the metallic arts is steel. allomantic use[edit] an iron misting is known as a lurcher. ironpulling is the art of burning iron to pull metals toward (in a straight line) the user's ""center of self,"" which is likely tied to the allomancer's cognitive and spiritual aspects. there are two general rules for ironpulling, which also apply to steelpushing, its paired opposite. the first rule is that the strength of your pull is roughly proportional to your physical mass. this means that larger allomancers can generally ironpull and steelpush more powerfully than a smaller counterpart. while proportional, the force exerted by an ironpull is much greater than the lurcher's weight, allowing them to pull themselves through the air by pulling on a piece of metal that weighs more than they do (or is anchored to something that does). the second rule is that metal that is at least partially inside a person's body cannot be affected by iron. both of these rules can be overcome by a sufficiently strong lurcher, however. when burning iron, blue lines emerge from the lurcher and connect themselves to pieces of nearby metals, with the size of the iron line indicating how big the metal is. the iron lines can typically only be seen by the lurcher. the iron lines manifest themselves on the spiritual realm and can be cut or interfered with. it is also possible to use the iron lines to see via the trace metals in everyone's bodies and in the objects around them, or even axi and electromagnetic bonds. a lurcher could identify specific metals, or even colors, with the iron lines. of the two external physical metals, iron is by far the less flashy. utilized by a misting, iron is generally used as a purely defensive mechanism, cancelling out the efforts of enemy coinshots by ironpulling enemy projectiles into a wooden shield. iron is also less useful by itself in jumping, since using iron requires a large, well-anchored piece of metal at your destination. both metals' performance are greatly enhanced when used in tandem, allowing feats like those performed by kelsier in his battle with the inquisitor bendal. an especially skilled allomancer can pull on individual parts of a metal object. through unknown means, a lurcher could pull on non-metal objects. due to it being possible with steelpushes, it is supposedly possible to affect the polarity of axi via an ironpull, under the right circumstances. lurchers can also pull on liquid metals, which would work similarly to the behavior of ferrofluids. feruchemical use[edit] an iron ferring is known as a skimmer. iron is used to store or retrieve (gain) physical mass. this is accomplished by changing the skimmer's mass, not by changing the effect of gravity on the skimmer, i.e. it does not modify weight directly. this change does not affect things that the skimmer wears, but is great enough that a skimmer storing mass can typically safely fall any distance, as the skimmer's surface area is typically sufficient to slow the fall to safe speeds. a skimmer tapping iron can grow proportionally heavier than normal, and although this is not as useful as storing mass in many cases, it has significant martial applications. specifically, by tapping iron during key moments, skimmers can add force to their blows, and can use added weight to withstand attacks. it can be used to counter coinshots or lurchers, for example. by increasing weight when pushed, one can instead push the coinshot back. furthermore, the added mass from tapping an ironmind can wreak havoc with steelpushes and ironpulls if the skimmer is being used as the anchor. tapping iron grants the skimmer the strength required to remain standing, including a partial increase in the density of their body, but this increase in density is limited and does not, for example, affect the skimmer's vulnerability to penetration. storing weight costs the skimmer some strength. the law of conservation of momentum still exists when using iron feruchemy, so while tapping weight doesn't significantly increase the speed of falling (not considering air resistance), decreasing one's weight to half will double one's speed. feruchemical iron interferes with an individual's interaction with the higgs field. it also allows people to easily adapt to low-gravity planets. a skimmer could decrease the duration of a basic lashing by increasing their own weight. hemalurgic use[edit] when used as a hemalurgic spike, iron steals physical strength. increasing the number of spikes increases the strength of the recipient, but at the cost of twisting the body and mind of the person who receives the spikes. hemalurgic constructs[edit] koloss are created when a living human is implanted with four iron spikes. this gives the koloss incredible strength, but the process effectively destroys their minds, leaving them incapable of complex logic and extremely vulnerable to ruin's control. kandra blessing[edit] the kandra can use a pair of these spikes as a blessing and call them the blessing of potency. like all kandra blessings, the blessing gives the mistwraiths sentience, with the added benefit of physical strength and endurance. it is similar to an allomancer burning pewter, however the added strength and endurance cannot be regulated or changed. fabrial use[edit] a fabrial with an iron cage will physically attract the element corresponding with the trapped spren, creating an attractor fabrial. for example, a fabrial that draws nearby smoke and causes it to accumulate near the device. aetheric use[edit] putting an iron tool near a growing aether substance pulls the substance in towards the tool as it grows. notes[edit]"
Soundstick,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Soundstick,"""“a crack sounded behind her. vin cried out, her tin-enhanced ears overreacting to the sudden sound. pain shot through her head, and she raised hands to her ears. ”-vin after someone uses soundsticks"" soundsticks are wooden sticks that, when banged together, produce a loud noise. they are used to overload the senses of a tineye or mistborn burning tin. a smoker uses soundsticks to overload vin's tin-enhanced hearing during her fight with ashweather cett's assassins. after the watcher kills the smoker, vin uses the soundsticks to fight off a group of thugs. trivia[edit] years before the well of ascension was published, a member of brandon's writing group suggested the idea of soundsticks to him. brandon loved the idea, as it plays off the benefit mistborn get from burning tin and fits well with the concept of actions and reaction in allomancy. notes[edit]"
Weathering,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Weathering,"weathering is a remote town in the northern roughs. it is west of covingtar and northeast of feltrel. geography[edit] located on a flat grassland plain, weathering is made up of a cluster of dusty houses and shops with unpaved dirt roads. it is the westernmost stop of the railway line in the northern roughs. weathering is rural enough that wild animals can be seen grazing just outside the town. history[edit] when waxillium ladrian and wayne first arrived in weathering, the local saloon was the base of operations for notorious outlaw granite joe. half the town was said to belong to joe. after joe's death at the hands of lessie, wax decided that it might be a good idea to begin his task of changing the roughs by working on this one town first, making himself the de-facto lawman of weathering; although it took six years of work before anyone gave him credentials to make the position official. for most of weathering's history there was a population of around 1500 people, with as many as 1500 more in the surrounding areas. the population was relatively steady, but grew rapidly in recent years. while some of that can be attributed to wax's lawkeeping, the population growth likely had more to do with the arrival of a railway line into the city, which happened during his tenure there. when wax eventually left for elendel, he entrusted wayne with the responsibility of keeping order in weathering. wayne's subsequent departure left barl, someone wax described as a ""miscreant,"" in charge of keeping the peace in the area. notes[edit]"
Granite Joe,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Granite_Joe,"granite joe was a koloss-blooded criminal in the roughs of scadrial. history[edit] he had many people in the roughs in his pay, making him extremely dangerous to hunt. he told wax that he and other lawmen should leave the roughs, as the whole point of the roughs is to get away from the laws of elendel. ""“we came here to escape folks like you. your rules. your assumptions. we don’t want you. ”-granite joe to wax during their standoff"" during his fifth year in the roughs waxillium ladrian hunted him for killing somebody's son. joe had discovered that wax was metalborn and laid an ambush in weathering's saloon. during a standoff with wax in the basement of the bar he was killed by lessie with a crossbow, believing her to be on his side after paying her off. notes[edit]"
Bendalloy,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Slider,"bendalloy is the external temporal pushing metal. an allomancer burning bendalloy is able to squeeze time in a bubble around them, making it pass more quickly. feruchemists can use bendalloy to store nutritional energy, and when used as a hemalurgic spike, bendalloy steals spiritual feruchemical powers. it is an alloy of cadmium and bismuth, the alloy paired with cadmium in the metallic arts. bendalloy is expensive, with one nugget costing around five hundred notes. allomantic use[edit] a bendalloy misting is known as a slider. burning bendalloy pushes on time around the user, causing time to pass more quickly in a bubble around them. events outside the bubble appear to move much slower to someone inside. when a bendalloy bubble and a cadmium bubble occur in the same place, their effects cancel out resulting in no change whilst still burning the metals used. the time bubble created by a slider is approximately five to fifteen feet across and is smaller than that possible while burning cadmium. careful examination may reveal the edge of the bubble, where air appears to shimmer. as long as some part of a person is inside the speed bubble, they will be included in its effect. when a time bubble is created, the area of the bubble stays stationary relative to a moving object as long as the slider creating it is stationed on an object large enough. for example, someone standing on a planet, which is quite massive, is still actually moving with the rotation of the planet, and the bubble moves with that person, but the bubble itself stays in the same place relative to the planet. however, if the slider who created a time bubble is on a small, moving object (or the person merely walks to the edge of the bubble), the slider will be transported through the bubble, ""popping"" it. objects entering or exiting the bubble are thrown wildly off-course, most likely because different parts of the object are moving at different speeds during the transition. when leaving the bubble, time bubbles interfere with almost all forms of investiture. however, they do not interfere with emotional allomancy. when multiple bubbles occur in the same space their effects are multiplied, as it speeds up the already sped up time. the amount of investiture required is proportional to the size of the bubble and the factor of compression. if a slider flares bendalloy when forming a time bubble, time inside the bubble is sped up to a great degree, likely related to a larger amount of investiture being used at one time, therefore leading to an increase in the compression factor. the size and speed of the bubble is pretty much determined when it's first formed, except more skilled users can actively change the size and shape, and reduce the interval between the creation of new bubbles. when one ingests a very large amount of bendalloy and burns duralumin, time is sped up by an extreme degree, and the bubble appears to solidify like crystal, and cracks as it fades. light appears to act strangely outside of the bubble. bendalloy is involved in multiple ways with faster-than-light travel. a speed bubble can be popped by aluminum. savantism[edit] if someone were able to burn the amount of bendalloy needed to become an allomantic savant with the metal, they would be able to anchor the speed bubble to themselves, allowing the speed bubble to move with them. this would cause complications for objects moving in and out of the bubble as energy is transferred to and from the spiritual realm to prevent redshift and blueshift. they would also be able to influence the size of the bubble and the amount of time it gives. feruchemical use[edit] a bendalloy ferring is known as a subsumer. bendalloy is used to store nutrition and calories. while filling a bendalloymind, a subsumer is able to eat large quantities of food without becoming full. tapping such a metalmind will allow the user to go without food. a separate bendalloymind can be used to store fluid intake. compounding[edit] a bendalloy compounder would be able to use bendalloy to survive without food or water. hemalurgic use[edit] when used as a hemalurgic spike, bendalloy steals spiritual feruchemical powers (chromium, nicrosil, aluminum, and duralumin). history[edit] during the final empire, cadmium and bendalloy were inaccessible and unknown to allomancers, though they were possibly known to the lord ruler. the fact that their technology couldn't create the metals made mistings of these types impossible to discover. after the catacendre, advancement in technology eventually made the metals available. trivia[edit] - in an original mockup of the complete table of allomantic metals, this metal was named cerrobend. however, the word cerrobend was a trademarked, commercial name for the - , and so - was forced to use bendalloy instead. - the original plans for bendalloy and cadmium involved redshifting or blueshifting of light passing through the bubble. but this was dropped as it would have lead to people outside being microwaved and blasted with radiation. - this was solved through the transfer of energy between the physical and spiritual realms. - the real world alloy for - is 50% bismuth, 26.7% lead, 13.3% tin, and 10% cadmium. this is supported in-world by it being called an alloy of bismuth and cadmium. - the time dilation effect of bendalloy was originally defined as compressing 2 minutes of time into 15 seconds without flaring the metal. this was changed with the leatherbound release of alloy of law to leave the exact compression ratio to be ambiguous. notes[edit]"
True Body,https://coppermind.net/wiki/True_Body,"a true body was an artificial skeleton crafted by a kandra artisan for kandra to wear while they were in the kandra homeland. the first generation was the only generation not to wear true bodies, they did not have the skill or knowledge to craft them when they first became kandra, so the lord ruler returned their original skeletons for them from when they had been human. styles[edit] most true bodies were crafted in human shape, with four limbs and a human-like face. kandra typically kept their skin transparent and wore little clothing while in the homeland, displaying their true bodies to other kandra. if kandra went about bare, they did not create genitals while wearing their true body. heights among true bodies varied. however, younger generations, such as the sevenths, often wore true bodies that were not in human form. some were unnaturally thin, block-like, or had triangular faces, over-sized eyes, and bits of cloth in their head, like hair. others had more limbs than humans. many of the older generations were more conservative, and found these types of true bodies distasteful and improper. materials[edit] materials used for true bodies varied, although specific generations tended to use certain types of materials. - crystal - used often by the second generation, such as - . these true bodies were beautiful but fragile and could be tinted various colors, such as red. - they can be used as a - . - quartzite stone - used often by the fifth generation, such as - . these were strong true bodies, and often coupled with the - , which made the kandra who possessed them formidable warriors. - these true bodies could be cracked by a heavy weight. - they were considered lavish and they sparkled slightly in the light. - wood - used often by the seventh generation, such as - . these bodies were often carved into unusual shapes. trivia[edit] - if brandon was a kandra he would have a true body made out of marble or obsidian. notes[edit]"

Cadmium,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Pulser,"cadmium is the external temporal pulling metal. an allomancer burning cadmium is able to stretch time in a bubble around them, making it pass more slowly. feruchemists can use cadmium to store breath, and when used as a hemalurgic spike, cadmium steals temporal allomantic powers. the paired alloy of cadmium used in the metallic arts is bendalloy. allomantic use[edit] a cadmium misting is known as a pulser. burning cadmium pulls on time around the user, causing time to pass more slowly in a bubble around them. events outside the bubble appear to move much faster to someone inside. when a cadmium bubble and a bendalloy bubble occur in the same place, their effects cancel out resulting in no change whilst still burning the metals used. the time bubble created by a pulser is about the size of a room, larger than a time bubble created by burning bendalloy. careful examination may reveal the edge of the bubble, where air appears to shimmer. as long as some part of a person is inside the slowness bubble, they will be included in its effect. when a time bubble is created, the area of the bubble stays stationary with respect to a moving object as long as the pulser creating it is stationed on an object large enough. for example, someone standing on a planet, which is quite massive, is still actually moving with the rotation of the planet, and the bubble moves with that person, but the bubble itself stays in the same place with respect to the planet. however, if the pulser who created a time bubble is on a small, moving object (or the person merely walks to the edge of the bubble), the pulser will be transported through the bubble, ""popping"" it. objects entering or exiting the bubble are thrown wildly off-course, most likely because different parts of the object are moving at different speeds during the transition. when leaving the bubble, time bubbles interfere with almost all forms of investiture. when multiple bubbles occur in the same space their effects are multiplied. some potential ""non-combative"" uses for cadmium allomancy include advancing personal time to a desired date, performance art in which one or more performers utilize cadmium ""pulses"" to enhance the exhibition, and scientific observation of processes/reactions which would otherwise not be observable in real-time.[citation needed] slowness bubbles can be popped by aluminum. savantism[edit] if someone were able to burn the amount of cadmium needed to become an allomantic savant with the metal, they would be able to slow time to a greater degree than a regular misting. they would be able to anchor the slowness bubble to themselves, allowing the slowness bubble to move with them. this would cause complications for objects moving in and out of the bubble as energy is transferred to and from the spiritual realm to prevent redshift and blueshift. they would also be able to influence the size of the bubble and the amount of time it gives. feruchemical use[edit] a cadmium ferring is known as a gasper. cadmium is used to store breath. while storing breath, the gasper must hyperventilate to keep their body oxygenated. tapping a cadmiummind allows the user to go without breathing, or to introduce extra oxygen into their bloodstream. hemalurgic use[edit] when used as a hemalurgic spike, cadmium steals temporal allomantic powers (cadmium, bendalloy, gold, and electrum). history[edit] during the final empire, cadmium and bendalloy were inaccessible and unknown to allomancers, though they were possibly known to the lord ruler. the fact that their technology couldn't create the metals made mistings of these types impossible to discover. after the catacendre, advancement in technology eventually made the metals available. trivia[edit] - the original plans for bendalloy and cadmium involved blueshifting and redshifting or blueshifting of light passing through the bubble. but this was dropped as it would have lead to people outside being microwaved and blasted with radiation. - this was solved through the transfer of energy between the physical and spiritual realms. notes[edit]"
House Harms,https://coppermind.net/wiki/House_Harms,"house harms is a noble house in elendel, scadrial. members include jackstom harms, steris, marasi, and armal harms. under jackstom's care, house harms had grown into a house with an excellent financial status, enough even to bolster the dire financial straits of one of the city's largest, most influential houses. despite this, their name was unknown in the highest circles of elendel society, a fact that caused much consternation for the house lord and his daughter steris. since there was no male heir, they proposed to remedy this situation by an alliance through marriage with waxillium ladrian, lord of house ladrian, which was in financial trouble after years of supposed mismanagement by the former lord edwarn ladrian. the partnership of the two houses became official with the wedding of waxillium and steris in 342. in addition to their substantial wealth, the family also had lands in the outer estates and owned a mansion in elendel which served as the primary residence for steris and lord harms. despite their lower status among the nobility both steris and jackstom had a least high enough standing to be invited events such as the yomen-ostlin wedding dinner. the family had ancestral ties to the lord mistborn, and as a result allomancy ran strong in the family line. this fact made steris, marasi, and armal targets for the vanishers. family tree[edit] notes[edit]"
Pahn Kahl,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Pahn_Kahl,"""“ but everyone knows the pahn kahl are practically hallandren. ”- lightsong on the pahn kahl"" pahn kahl is a small territory under the control of hallandren on nalthis. the pahn kahl form a distinct but often overlooked group within the culturally dominant hallandren, with a separate language and religion. they were formerly an independent country, but were absorbed into hallandren after their defeat in the manywar. three centuries later, many of the pahn kahl still longed for independence. geography and ecology[edit] ""“ perhaps you can imagine their surprise upon arriving here? a place with beaches of fine, soft sand, with fruits aplenty, and with strange, alien forests?”-hoid telling a story about the discovery of the hallandren lowlands"" the pahn kahl people live in the hallandren lowlands. these lowlands have a tropical climate, although the growth of plants in this region is also partly helped by investiture from endowment’s perpendicularity. the soil in this valley is also the only place on nalthis where the tears of edgli grow. to the east of this valley is a large landlocked body of water called the bright sea. the lowlands suffer from frequent earthquakes. elephants and zebras are said to be exotic creatures from ""the south.” whether this means they come from the area in which the pahn kahl live or south of this area is unclear. the jungle in which the pahn kahl live is inhabited by panthers, parrots, monkeys, and crocodiles. the bright sea is also full of life, including many sorts of mussels, fish, and tentacled creatures. culture[edit] people and language[edit] the pahn kahl are racially different from the dominantly hallandren population. they have a different skin tone and facial features than the hallandren.they are also shorter on average than the hallandren. pahn kahl also have their own language. its words are full of airy sounds. despite these differences, they are often mistaken for hallandren, to their irritation. the pahn kahl have no problem with giving away their breath like the idrians. they have many skilled awakeners. religion[edit] the pahn kahl religion has similarities with the iridescent tones, but is more abstract and does not include worship of the returned. rather, it involves a kind of nature worship where the storms of the bright sea are revered as manifestations of the unity of their five gods. their religion also has more a focus on the voice that calls the returned, that is actually endowment. it is uncertain how they relate this voice to their five gods. in their theology, the returned are those who lived just lives but died lacking in faith. they are forbidden entrance into heaven but are not sent to hell. instead, they are given a second chance to find the true faith in life by returning. many of the pahn kahl do not mind the returned, and accept the god king as monarch. they simply see the returned as misguided. since they do not see them as divinities, the only thing the pahn kahl find extraordinary about the returned is the strength of their biochroma. many outsiders consider the pahn kahl religion to be simplistic, especially in contrast with the elaborate doctrine of the iridescent tones. in fact, many people in hallandren and beyond have no understanding of the religion or are not even aware that the pahn kahl have their own separate religion at all. unfortunately, some aspects of the pahn kahl religion have been forgotten even by its followers, due in part to their single-minded desire for independence from hallandren. economy[edit] as pahn kahl is located in the jungle they have access to many unique resources and products, which they can trade with faraway lands. they also used to, and may still, fish the bright sea. due to their location near endowment’s perpendicularity they might also be able to grow the tears of edgli in their province. nonetheless pahn kahl are often employed in the dye fields, though their overseers are hallandren. cuisine[edit] only one example of pahn kahl cuisine is currently known. the sweet pastries called tinkfans are considered to be a delicacy. they are even eaten by the returned in the court of gods. tinkfans are traditionally consumed in small bites, with a small piece of bread eaten between each bite as a palate cleanser. within hallandren[edit] within the kingdom of hallandren, the pahn kahl were often ignored, seen as second class citizens typically less trustworthy than the hallandren. on the other hand, many not familiar with the pahn kahl may struggle to differentiate the pahn kahl from the other hallandren; oftentimes they are not seen as their own distinct people. this confusion is a great annoyance to them. the pahn kahl are often marginalized by the hallandren, and are very frustrated with being ignored and subjugated by them. this is especially infuriating to them as the pahn kahl were the first people in the region, and have been conquered by relative newcomers. many of the pahn kahl live a difficult life, working under harsh overseers in the dye fields. some have managed to work their way into high importance but low prestige jobs, such as stewards and servants for the priests and returned in the court of the gods. this provides a far better life than working in the dye fields. this work is however unstable, anytime a new god king is chosen, all his workers lose their jobs. in addition to this, pahn kahl servants have to work harder to gain jobs within the theocracy, and those jobs are often more difficult than the hallandren servants. they all required to wear brown robes and are forbidden to speak to or touch the god king himself. in fact they are not even permitted to be servants to the god king, although they may be servants to his wife. pahn kahl are also not permitted to serve as priests to the gods either. all these things have led to their rebellious spirit and their desire for revenge and freedom. consumed by their anger, as well as their desire for independence, the pahn kahl have lost much of their cultural identity.. history[edit] newcomers[edit] the pahn kahl people are the natives to the hallandren jungle., during their early history they lived in a collection of fishing villages along the coast. when the people of chedesh began exploring other parts of the inner sea's coastline a group of their ships discovered this valley filled with jungles. one of the explorers, vo, died and became the first returned while on one of the ships in the bay. he then died again a week later. dismissing the native pahn kahl, his crewmates founded a kingdom on the site and named it hanald. as hanald grew the pahn kahl established their own kingdom, claiming the southern parts of the lowlands. tensions and the manywar[edit] as the dye trade was one of the main reasons for hanald’s quick growth, they started a monopoly on the dye trade, and other kingdoms, including pahn kahl, quickly grew to resent them because of it, and also started hoping to take control of hallandren and share in the dye profits. as hanald grew they turned their attention towards the newly discovered art of awakening. during this time major discoveries and developments were made in awakening. a lot of these discoveries were made by the five scholars, a few examples include the command to make lifeless with a single breath and the invention of ichor-alcohol. these discoveries allowed nations to build far larger and cheaper armies. because many of these discoveries were made in hanald the other nations grew scared as they would only get behind farther and farther as time passed. at some point, one of the returned in hanald had a vision of war. this ended up being the catalyst for a war, as it prompted strifelover to strike preemptively against the other nations. what was to become known as the manywar broke out. the pahn kahl generally hold that this war was the fault of hanald's royal family, who they accuse of seeking new awakening techniques and lifeless without realizing these could be turned against them. at some point the kingdom of pahn kahl joined or created the pahn unity along with multiple other kingdoms. this coalition would fight against the forces of hanald the famous battle of the twilight falls is a well known example of this. the leader of the pahn unity died in this battle. near the end of the war pahn kahl was conquered by hanald, its people being enslaved and made to work. after the manywar ended and hanald split pahn kahl became a province in the south of hallandren. it’s people would eventually become second class citizens, over time the pahn kahl people became heavily associated with their conquerors, with few outside of pahn kahl understanding or caring about the difference between the two peoples. most pahn kahl work hard labour intensive jobs in the dye fields. while the people kept wishing for independence pahn kahl earned a reputation for being a quiet and peaceful province. failed rebellions[edit] for more information see vahr, and the pahn kahl rebellion. ""“ you're from pahn kahl, yet everyone always just assumes that your people are hallandren. the pahn kahl people were here first, in this land, but it was taken from you. now you're just another province, part of the kingdom of your conquerors. ”- siri to bluefingers"" despite their defeat, the pahn kahl were not content to remain subjugated. approximately three hundred years after the defeat of the pahn unity, around the year 321, a pahn kahl man named vahr began to foment rebellion among the pahn kahl dye workers and dissidents. he convinced many of them to give him their breath and began to assemble an army. little to vahr's knowledge, a second group of pahn kahl, led by the god king susebron's steward, havarseth, were also independently plotting a rebellion. havarseth, also known as bluefingers, felt that vahr's rebellion was drawing too much attention to the pahn kahl people. bluefingers leaked information about vahr into the court of the gods resulting in vahr's capture and the end of his rebellion. bluefingers's own rebellion was far more subtle than vahr's. as he did not have his own army, he instead conspired to instigate a war between hallandren and idris, hoping that in the fighting pahn kahl could declare independence and break away. due to his high-level position as the god king's steward, bluefingers was in the perfect position to manipulate events, and his actions were often overlooked or ignored because of his race. bluefingers sneaked pahn kahl awakeners into the court through tunnels to begin breaking the lifeless in hallandren's armies. he later used these lifeless, along with mercenaries and pahn kahl scribes disguised as priests to take control of the god king's palace and capture both the god king and his wife, sisirinah. he also gained control of the rest of hallandren's forty thousand lifeless soldiers by forcing the returned gods lightsong and blushweaver to reveal their commands. these lifeless were then commanded to march on idris to start a new war. bluefingers intended to kill both blushweaver and lightsong then plant their corpses surrounded by idrian bodies, making it appear as if idrian rebels had killed them in retaliation for deploying the lifeless against idris. he also intended to kill both siri and susebron and make it appear as if the god king had his wife sacrificed on an altar and had been killed by vengeful idrian assassins. however, lightsong thwarted these plans by healing the god king's maimed tongue with his divine breath, allowing susebron to finally make use of his incredibly strong biochroma to save siri, and defeat the pahn kahl rebels. peacegiver, who had been attempting to prevent this conflict on his own in the guise of vasher, gave susebron control of his ancient army of lifeless, kalad's phantoms. susebron used this army to defeat the lifeless soldiers that were marching on idris, preventing the war between the two kingdoms and quashing the pahn kahl rebellion. notable people[edit] - : a failed revolutionary who tried to lead the pahn kahl to freedom through force. - : a mercenary working for - . - : also called bluefingers, serves as steward to the god king while plotting his own rebellion. trivia[edit] - brandon often adds an additional ""h"" to pahn kahl words in order to distinguish them and make them sound ""airier"". - one of brandon's concerns is that he made the pahn kahl too forgettable to the reader as well, lessening the impact of their rebellion. - one of the things that would be explored further in - , the sequel to - is the pahn kahl and their culture. notes[edit]"
Hanald,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Hanald,"hanald is a historical kingdom on nalthis located in the lowlands of modern hallandren and the highlands of modern idris. at the conclusion of the manywar, it split into the kingdoms of hallandren and idris. geography and ecology[edit] ""“tiny flowers grew in great blanketing swaths on the ground. large, drooping pink blossoms hung from trees, like bundles of grapes, flowers growing practically on top of one another in a large cluster. even the weeds had flowers. ”-siri describing the lowlands"" hanald encompassed large parts of the lowlands of modern day hallandren, the rest being controlled by the pahn kahl, they also controlled the highlands of modern day idris. it is bordered by the bright sea to the east. the capital city, t'telir, still sits on the coastline and is a major trade center. the tears of edgli grow only in the soil of hanald, and later hallandren. this is due to investiture seeping into the ground from endowment's perpendicularity. the valley has a moderate climate that is never too cold and rarely experiences harsh weather. while the mountains experience cold weather, and few warm summers. the climate in the valley allows food to be grown without difficulty, while agriculture is harder in the mountains due to the cold. powerful earthquakes are a frequent occurrence in the valley. the growth of plants in this region is partly helped by investiture, much like the elendel basin. the lowlands are inhabited by panthers, parrots, monkeys, and crocodiles. the bright sea is full of life, including many sorts of mussels, fish, and tentacled creatures. elephants and zebras are said to be exotic creatures from ""the south."" while this is said during the age of hallandren, these two kingdoms are in roughly the same place, so it can be assumed this is still valid. however it is unclear whether this means they come from southern hanald or south of hanald. the northern mountains have vegetation that buds out in spring, though it only gets warm for a brief period each year. some valuable roots grow high up in the mountains. there are fields and meadows with grasses and wild flowers. the air is crisp and chilly due to the elevation. a known type of flower is the vanavel, the flower and the roots from this plant are eatable. there are also berry bushes in the highlands. culture and economics[edit] people and religion[edit] the people of hanald were likely of chedesh origin, due to the kingdom being started by a group of chedesh men and women. there were probably some pahn kahl living in the kingdom, although they had their own kingdom as well. the predominant religion was austrism, though back then it was very different from modern austrism. austrism back then hadn’t yet turned its back awakening and ostentation itself. this version of austrism also believed in an afterlife of some sort. the royal family followed it. at the same time the cult of the returned formed and began to worship the returned, believing that each individual had been sent from austre in order to fulfill a mission. they were the individuals who discovered, maintained, and named warbreaker the peaceful and glorysinger. economy[edit] ""“it controlled a uniquely lucrative region which, through the discovery and maintenance of the northern passes-combined with increasingly skillful navigation-was becoming a jewel coveted by the rest of the world.”-hoid describing hanald"" the new kingdom of hanald flourished quickly, likely because of the dye trade, as hanald was the only kingdom in which the tears of edgli grew, and also because of all the other products which can only be found in the jungles and mountains of hanald. hanald was also situated on the shores of the bright sea, opening many trade routes to other nations such as tedradel. hanald’s capital was the prime port of t’telir, further advancing trade. the mountains of modern day idris were in its domain as well, and with it access to many minerals, including the only copper mines in the known world. these mountains also opened trade routes to the northern kingdoms, such as kuth and huth. politics and royals[edit] the kingdom was ruled by either a king or a queen. as the idrian royal family still does this it can be assumed that the eldest child, be it man or woman, inherited the throne. the first ruler was vo’s wife, who became queen of hanald after his death. shortly before his death he impregnated her, starting the royal line of hanald, the people of this line would rule hanald for the next three hundred years. those of the royal family who either ruled or were potential heirs had the royal locks: hereditary hair that changes color according to the bearer's emotional state, at their will, or not at all when the bearer uses training and discipline to suppress the changes. those with the royal locks can also grow them when they want to, and this feels to them as if they were using a physical muscle. the servants of hanald’s kings were killed when the kings died so they could serve in the afterlife. t'telir[edit] the capital of hanald was called t'telir, this was a large city somewhere in the east of the nation. t’telir is located in a small bay on the shores of the bright sea, protecting it from storms and making it an excellent port. t’telir has a monopoly on dye production from the tears of edgli. other nations use the sea to bring exotic merchandise and fresh foods from their lands in trade. the royal family of hanald resided in a large black palace in t'telir,this building would later become the god king’s palace. during this time the palace was stark, built with odd twists and turns to confuse an invading foe. history[edit] settling and expanding[edit] the region that became hanald was originally populated by the pahn kahl people, who lived in a collection of fishing villages. when the people of chedesh, who dominated the world at the time, began exploring other parts of the inner sea's coastline, a group of their ships discovered this valley filled with jungles. one of the explorers, vo, died and became the first returned while on one of the ships in the bay. he then died again a week later. dismissive of the native pahn kahl, his crewmates founded a kingdom on the site and named it hanald. they elected vo's wife, who was pregnant with his child, as their queen. the kingdom of hanald quickly expanded, eventually claiming most of the lowlands as well as the highlands. they faced little resistance during this time, as the only other kingdom in the lowlands was pahn kahl, which wasn’t very mighty. the economy of hanald grew quickly as well, likely because of the farming of the tears of edgli and other products native to the lowlands. at some point large mineral deposits were found in the northern mountains, hanald founded mines in this region, this includes a number of copper mines. tensions and the manywar[edit] the dye trade was one of the main reasons for hanald’s quick growth, because of this the kingdom quickly started a stranglehold on the dye trade, making sure the trade was completely dependent on hanald. due to this relations with other kingdoms worsened. the royal family also turned it’s attention to the development of the relatively new art of awakening. during this period major discoveries and developments were made in awakening. a lot of these discoveries were made by the five scholars, a few examples include the command to make lifeless with a single breath and the invention of ichor-alcohol. these discoveries allowed nations to build far larger and cheaper armies. because many of these discoveries were made in hanald the other nations grew scared as they would only get behind farther and farther as time passed. at some point, one of the returned in hanald had a vision of war. this ended up being the catalyst for a war, as it prompted strifelover to strike preemptively against the other nations. strifelover used his knowledge of biochroma and awakening to raise up a vast army. in the beginning, it seemed the royal family made strifelover their general. however, he used this army, and the royal family's own awakeners and lifeless, as well as a revolt of the people, to seize control of hanald from them. the family promptly fled t'telir, fleeing to the highlands. what was to become known as the manywar broke out. hanald's main rivals, kuth and huth, were destroyed in the war, and hanald itself was renamed a variation of its old name. the kingdom of hallandren was born in its place when peacegiver established the line of the god kings. hanald's former royal lineage fled to the mountains and established the kingdom of idris, thus splitting the kingdom of hanald. notes[edit]"
Bright Sea,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Inner_Sea,"the bright sea is a large, but landlocked, body of water on nalthis adjacent to hallandren. t'telir is built against its shore. name[edit] the bright sea is its original name. since idris split from hallandren, idrians call the sea the inner sea, to downplay its importance, since idris was landlocked. idris and hallandren usually have different names for geographical features, due to the bad blood between them. however, in many cases, both names stuck, so inner sea and bright sea are used interchangeably by many. geography[edit] the people of chedesh sailed the bright sea, coming from the east, and first discovered the place that would later be named hallandren. at the time of the pahn kahl rebellion, hallandren owns approximately one third of the coast of the bright sea. tedradel is also on the far side of the bright sea to hallandren and idris. the pahn kahl believe that the storms of the bright sea are a manifestation of their unity of five gods. trade[edit] t'telir's being located on the bright sea, as well as it's access to the tears of edgli, have turned the city into a prime port. it is a bustling city of commerce and trade in no small part due to the ease of access the bright sea provides. the bright sea is partly why hallandren has become the economic powerhouse it is at the time of the pahn kahl rebellion. trivia[edit] there may be a connection between endowment and the bright sea. notes[edit]"
Five Visions,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Five_Visions,"""“don’t draw attention to yourself. don’t set yourself above others. he who makes himself high will be cast low. ”-vivenna quoting one of the five visions"" the five visions are part of the doctrine of austrism, a religion primarily practiced in idris on nalthis. they are guidelines spoken by the first returned, vo, as a message from the god austre. tenets[edit] the visions teach the believers of austre to be patient, humble, sacrificing, selfless, and understanding. followers should not be ostentatious, haughty, selfish, or place themselves above others. history[edit] ""“i saw men who placed themselves above others, and i saw them cast down. ”-vivenna quoting one of the five visions"" vo, the first returned, was born aboard a ship sailing to the coast. he declared the five visions and died the next week, according to hoid. to set an example in following the five visions, every noble or rich idrian family was obligated by tradition to provide one person to the monasteries. vivenna decided to become a monk at a young age, and was able to quote several of the visions from memory as an adult. conversely, siri had difficulty even naming all five of the visions. vivenna later realized that many followers of austrism took the idea of humility from the five visions too far, causing them to wrongly condemn awakening. notes[edit]"
Chedesh,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Chedesh,"chedesh was a nation on ancient nalthis, which had a large empire. legacy[edit] the people of chedesh are described as having dominated the world in their age. however, their writings are sparse, and they have long faded away in the present day, though hoid says their memory remains. the chedesh people are credited with discovering the tropical, jungle region that would later be hallandren, along with the tears of edgli, though the pahn kahl are originally native to the region. vo was on a chedesh ship, and returned along the coast of hallandren. the people of that ship found a kingdom, which they name hanald, on the beach that t'telir is located. hanald is eventually renamed to hallandren, its modern name. the people of chedesh travel the bright sea from the east, opposite from hallandren, which is a similar description as to where tedradel is from, so tedradel could be where chedesh was originally. notes[edit]"
Fafen,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Fafen,"""“the treaty,"" vivenna said. ""it protects our people.""""austre protects our people. ”-fafen and vivenna discussing siri's departure from idris."" fafen was a princess of idris, the third child of king dedelin, with elder siblings being vivenna, ridger, and her younger sister being siri. of the three sisters, fafen was the middle sister in almost every way. she was midway in height between vivenna and siri, and less proper than vivenna, though not as careless as siri. fafen was a monk of austrism, and so she wore white robes and was required have her hair completely sheared off. her duty, as with all monks, is to grow food for the needy, do tasks around the city, and provide for those who could not provide for themselves. fafen made the choice to become a monk before her tenth birthday, and has devoted herself to this task ever since. it was tradition that noble or rich families were obligated to send a child to the monasteries. siri was happy that fafen was the monk in the family and not her, and said she would have gone crazy living as a monk. fafen also had a curvy figure, which attracted men around bevalis, but her status as a monk kept suitors at bay, as they would have to become monks if they wished to marry her. fafen had taken lessons in court life and politics in case vivenna died before marrying the god king of hallandren. when siri was sent to hallandren instead of vivenna, fafen believed that vivenna would inherit the throne of idris instead of ridger. fafen had a tendency to avoid thinking things through unless she was confronted with them directly, which meant that people often had to engage her with blunt comments to get through to her. notes[edit]"
Ridger,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Ridger,"ridger is a member of the idrian royal family on nalthis. as the second born child of king dedelin, ridger was trained to one day become king, as his elder sister was betrothed to become the queen of hallandren. appearance and personality[edit] ridger has a kind heart, always trying to do what was right. he had a good relationship with his youngest sister, siri. before ridger had to begin his training to become king, he and siri often got into trouble. history[edit] as second born child, he was set to inherit the throne because the eldest child, vivenna, was betrothed to susebron, the god king of hallandren. as a child he spent a lot of time with his sister siri getting into trouble. once he grew older and began to take on more responsibility, ridger spent the majority of his time focusing on his studies and being groomed to rule. when king dedelin chose not to send vivenna to hallandren, fafen believed vivenna would inherit the throne instead of ridger, which vivenna thought would upset the order of things even more. notes[edit]"

Reddi,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Reddi,"constable-general reddi is the constable-general of the 4th octant constabulary district in elendel on scadrial. appearance and personality[edit] reddi is described as a short and lean man, always being dressed in his constable's uniform with it looking neat during his duties. he has a large dropping mustache upon his face. when interacting with waxillium he is noted to never act rude towards him and be incredibly polite. when wax is not looking however he is known to sneer at him and make his disdain more apparent. this politeness however does not extend to everyone and he shows no qualms in openly disliking some individuals, such as marasi. reddi also had a reputation as being good as interrogations, in particular at beating confessions out of suspects. he disagrees with marasi's own style but is willing to admit she puts her witnesses at more ease than he can manage. he cares little for statistics. aradel considers reddi quite useless unless aggravated and trying to prove his worth to his superiors, because of this aradel somewhat encouraged his rivalry with marasi. history[edit] reddi reported to constable-general brettin after the vanishers raided the yomen-ostlin wedding dinner. he was given the duty to report to brettin the causalities of the attack and was noted to appear impressed at how waxillium ladrian and wayne subdued thirty-one members of the vanishers with only one civilian casualty. after wax and marasi's final confrontation with the vanishers reddi informed wax that brettin had decided not to charge wayne with impersonating an officer of the law. in the intervening years brettin retired and aradel came to succeed him as constable-general. reddi had hoped to become his assistant however aradel instead chose marasi, citing his preference to have assistants do more bureaucratic work, secretly her close connection to wax also influenced his thoughts. most constables however viewed the role as a promotion and considered it a slight that marasi got the role instead of reddi. this led to a strong animosity between the two, made all the worse as reddi was marasi's superior after she joined the force and that his friends shared his opinions towards colms. ""“reddi scowled at her.”-reddi reacting to marasi colms' suggestions"" reddi lead the investigation against the marksman and suspected that after hitting the first union he would retreat to a hideout of his in the seventh octant. this ultimately proved a mistaken assumption of his. following the death of innate's brother reddi was sent to secure the crime scene and immediately went out to find wax. following the death of the marksman reddi's crew dealt with the clean up and informed wax of the death of the constable's brother. after this he took the time to reprimand marasi and reminded her that her role did not allow her to partake in chases against criminals such as the marksman. she managed however to persuade him to allow her to speak with aradel meaning she joined them in their trip to investigate the crime scene. ""“i usually hate you, but all i feel is a mild dislike. someone is playing with my emotions.”-reddi to marasi when she questions how he feels"" reddi was present for an interrogation and it was suggested for him to ""interrogate"" the individual. marasi stopped him by pointing out that this would ruin their case much to reddi's annoyance, he went to paint marasi as unloyal to the constables before being reprimanded by aradel. he expressed exasperation at how flippant wax was towards the witness. later reddi was requested to not lead the questioning at the church of survivor and instead allow marasi to do so, afterwards he was then dismissed by aradel in order to give warm beverages to the witnesses so aradel and marasi could discuss the case in private. aradel readily admitted this was to aggravate reddi as he found the man worked better when annoyed and trying to prove his worth. reddi gave aradel comforting words of encouragement after aradel was promoted to lord high constable. he, with his peers, was put in charge of controlling the crowd during the governors speech and did a good job of keeping them back. upon realising that a soother was within the crowd marasi found reddi and warned him. reddi immediately went to get a squad of constables in order to apprehend the soother in question. together they and his squad went out to subdue the soother with hand to hand combat, they were quickly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of enemies against them. marasi seizes the chance to go ahead and hold the soother and rioter hostage and force them to ease the crowd. reddi's interrogation techniques proved useful for this. reddi later succeeded aradel as constable-general on marasi's recommendation when aradel ascended to the office of governor as successor to replar innate. when marasi and wayne went to the bank to know a gravekeeper who is grave robbing bu his ledgers to help them look for reluur's spike. the banker sent a telegram to reddi to confirm that marasi and wayne are constables. which reddi confirmed and added to the banker to check his pocket after wayne leaves. reddi led the constables who took the set's prisoners to constabulary awaiting prosecution. for two weeks afterwards, marasi and reddi worked very closely together on the notes, files, and interviews for the set members, it was sometimes hard for marasi to remember how bad their relationship was before. notes[edit]"

Vahr,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Vahr,"""“keep your part of the bargain. ”-vahr, asking vasher to kill him"" vahr is a pahn kahl rebel leader on nalthis. appearance & personality[edit] vahr's skin was pure tan. before his capture, vahr had been a plump man. however, after the imprisonment and torture he had grown painfully thin, and his body was covered in bruises, burns, and cuts. his eyes also took on a haunted look. vahr's personality too changed with his capture. he became harder and more emotionless, something vasher was finally able to identify with. attributes and abilities[edit] vahr is an awakener of the fourth heightening. this grants him: - aura recognition - allows him to assess the number of breaths a person possesses. - perfect pitch - perfect color recognition - allows him to instantly and instinctively determine exact shades of colors and their hue harmonics. - perfect life sense - allows him to sense people around him. history[edit] early years[edit] vahr spent his early life working long hours for little pay aside from food on the dye fields surrounding hallandren. during that time he spent at least a decade as a revolutionary, trying to convince his fellow workers to rebel. rebellion[edit] about five years before bluefingers' rebellion, vahr had an idea. he thought that if he could convince his fellow workers to give him their breath, he could use its power to start a rebellion against the overseers on the dye fields. as these breaths came from like-minded, rebellious people, vahr's determination and resolve were strengthened. at this point vahr attempted to raise a pahn kahl army to rebel against hallandren itself. he received financial support from hallandren's rival trading partners, possibly including tedradel. before long, vahr had become a hero to the workers in the outer flower plantations. however, vahr received support from local rebellious factions as well. he sought the help of idrian crime lords, such as rira, ashu, and paxen. they supplied vahr with money to feed his army, despite the fact that they did not like that he was not idrian. due to this, they were not particularly loyal to vahr's cause; they were mostly interested in increasing their wealth and influence. another strong, if weaker, ally to vahr's rebellion was the idrian crime lord grable. vahr was also supported discreetly by lemex and the idrian royal family. dedelin hoped that vahr's rebellion would cause hallandren to focus on the pahn kahl and would alleviate rising tensions between idris and hallandren. at some point during this time period, vahr met vasher, but the two had little in common. betrayal & capture[edit] unfortunately, vahr's newfound power and notoriety would end up working against him. his hero status among the dye workers drew the attention of the court of gods while the court considered him to be a fool who posed little threat to hallandren or t'telir, they were still interested in capturing him. bluefingers, whose own plans for rebellion were already in motion, was irked by vahr drawing attention to the dissatisfaction of the pahn kahl. bluefingers then leaked information to the returned which led to vahr's capture. vahr was imprisoned in the god king's dungeon, underneath his palace. vahr was kept in a special cell for awakeners. the walls had been drained of all color, and he was gagged and hung by his arms from the ceiling with metal chains so he had no ability to awaken anything. vahr's breath was so valuable that the government of hallandren did not want to execute him before he gave it to them. there they spent two weeks torturing him by beating, burning, and cutting him. as vahr's idrian supporters had never been terribly loyal, they quickly abandoned the cause when he was captured. however, a few, like grable, remained loyal to vahr despite his imprisonment. vahr's army was dispersed, but many still wished to see hallandren overthrown. death[edit] upon hearing of vahr's capture, vasher saw an opportunity he had been waiting two years for. he needed more breath to continue to live much longer as well as to fight. vasher picked a fight at a bar and punched a priest, landing him in the god king's jail awaiting execution. vasher awakened a small man of straw to fetch him the cell keys after nightblood disposed of the guards. he then went to vahr's cell and offered to kill vahr in exchange for vahr's breath. after vasher pointed out that vahr was unlikely to stand much more of the god king's torturers and promised that vahr's enemies would not get the breath, vahr acquiesced and gave vasher the breath. vasher then awakened a scarf and used the command ""strangle things"", which choked vahr to death. legacy[edit] while vahr ultimately failed in his goal to overthrow the government of hallandren, the people did not forget his promises. when vivenna was unknowingly fomenting insurrection, the memory of vahr's oaths was still fresh in their minds, so they listened and became more rebellious. however, the idrian crime lords had lost a lot of money to vahr's failure, and were hesitant to listen to her proposition, so denth lost their support in his quest to get idris and hallandren to go to war with one another. denth did however have the men attacking merchant caravans disguised to appear to be members of vahr's broken army. vahr's defeat made hallandren focus more on their enemies, primarily idris, so relations deteriorated even further. this also contributed to king dedelin's decision to send one of his daughters in fulfillment of his contract with susebron. idris's main general, yarda, hoped to rile up whatever remained of vahr's rebel army, as a few still remained. vahr also furnished vasher with hundreds of breaths, ensuring vasher's continued life and giving him enough power to once again perform complex awakenings. trivia[edit] - vahr's original name was ""pahn"". - liked the name so much, he named the whole nation of pahn kahl after pahn. however, he felt it would be confusing to have the two of them share a name, so he changed pahn's name to vahr. notes[edit]"

Vivenna's mother,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Vivenna%27s_mother,"vivenna's mother is the queen of idris on nalthis approximately 300 years after the manywar. history[edit] vivenna's mother married dedelin and had three daughters: vivenna, fafen, sisirinah, and one son ridger. she taught her daughters propriety, specifically teaching siri that it was unseemly to stare at young men. her older daughters especially felt that their mother supervised their lives and taught them to be controlled. she died over a decade prior to the pahn kahl rebellion in a riding accident. legacy[edit] vivenna, who keeps herself under control at all times largely because of her mother's influence, reminds dedelin very strongly of his late wife. this is a major factor in his decision not to send vivenna to hallandren, even though he doesn't admit this reasoning to himself. both of them are unpleasantly reminded of vivenna's mother's death when they see siri out taking rides on horseback; this leads to a lot of tension in their relationships, which siri doesn't understand because she doesn't remember her mother's death. notes[edit]"
Pahn Unity,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Pahn_Unity,"the pahn unity was the coalition of nations that were united against hallandren during the manywar. it is possible many pahn kahl joined in the unity to oppose the hallandren who had long occupied their land, hence the name of the coalition. it may have been referred to as a ""unity"" because the pahn kahl religion had five gods in a unity. it may have included gys, and almost surely included tedradel. the leader of the pahn unity was killed in the battle of twilight falls. notes[edit]"

Flog,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Flog,"flog is one of winsting innate's bodyguards in elendel on scadrial. appearance and personality[edit] ""“he’s watching us. the mists are his eyes, my lord. sure as ruin, that is. ”-flog"" although flog has never been outside of the elendel basin, he wears a style of hat and duster commonly seen in the roughs. unlike his employer, flog believes that the mists have supernatural properties and sometimes tries to avoid them. flog is loyal and obedient, although this is partially due to to winsting's rioting abilities. history[edit] flog was present for winsting innate's auction; he was the presumptive leader of winsting's security team. he was always at winsting's side, and was described as an excellent bodyguard. he was charged with monitoring the guest list for the auction and checking into each person's background, due to the illicit activity that was going to occur. there was one guest at the party-a slender blond woman accompanying dowser maline-that winsting did not recognize, and flog was baffled by her presence. when gunfire suddenly erupted, flog reacted quickly and led winsting to his basement saferoom. flog then went back upstairs to investigate. winsting let him into the saferoom when he returned, and flog reported that everyone was dead. as winsting tried to figure out what to do next, his throat was slit and he died. although winsting did not see the assailant, flog was the only other person in the room. bleeder, a kandra who was the unknown guest, had killed flog upstairs and shapeshifted into his form in order to gain access to winsting. notes[edit]"
Winsting Innate's auction,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Winsting_Innate%27s_auction,"winsting innate's auction is an event that occurred on scadrial in 342 pc. it was an auction held by winsting innate to sell his senate vote to the highest bidder. due to an attack by bleeder, everyone at the auction was killed. history[edit] the auction was held at winsting innate's mansion and was ostensibly held to auction off a piece of art that winsting had made, which was clearly worthless. half of the attendees were corrupt members of noble houses, while the other half included various representatives of elendel's criminal elements. the attendees had all spent weeks posturing about the meeting, but they showed up since they desired influence in upcoming senate votes. winsting had intentionally baited edwarn ladrian and thought he would attend, but he was not present. as the party commenced, winsting was confident that he would receive a large sum of money as a payoff. he chatted with several guests including hughes entrone and dowser maline, even subtly implying that his brother replar could also be bought. there was one attendee, a tall woman with short golden hair, that winsting did not recognize and believed to be a spy. after the auction had gotten underway, gunfire rang out from various parts of the room almost simultaneously. the attendees started shooting at each other in the confusion. winsting's guards disagreed on who started shooting first, and thought that it was either dowser or darm. however, the initial volley of gunfire in fact came from paalm, a mad kandra also known as bleeder. paalm had used a feruchemical steelmind to move around the room at superhuman speed while shooting key attendees. winsting's guards hustled him into a saferoom downstairs; two guards watched the stairs from outside the door. the shooting continued upstairs, and all of the attendees of the auction were killed. winsting's began fretting about the fallout to his reputation from the shootout. he allowed one of his guards, flog, into the saferoom, believing that he could trust him. however, flog was being impersonated by paalm. paalm slit winsting's throat, then cut out his tongue. she then killed the rest of the guards to cover her tracks. aftermath and investigation[edit] the elendel broadsheets eagerly covered winsting's death; the combination of high society members and criminals revealed to be present at the party raised concerns about government corruption. the elendel daily ran a late edition in order to include additional details about the party and the deceased attendees. replar was forced to defend his brother's reputation. wax, wayne, marasi, and the local constabulary came to investigate the disturbance the next day. in looking over the scene, wax determined that most of the attendees killed each other, but that key attendees were killed all at the same time by someone else. he also noted that winsting was killed by someone inside the saferoom and that the guards were killed from behind. this led the team to believe that a steelrunner might have been responsible. steelrunners were rare, and after visiting his grandmother vwafendal to narrow the list of suspects, wax deduced that someone had hemalurgically stolen the power from an old acquaintance, idashwy; her corpse was later found with a spike wound. harmony also revealed that the killer was a kandra. wax's investigation eventually led him to paalm, who revealed that she killed winsting ""because he had to die"" as part of her overall plan to sow chaos in elendel and disrupt harmony's influence. she had cut out his tongue to symbolically represent silencing harmony's voice. notes[edit]"
Kandra Homeland,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Trustwarren,"the homeland was the secret, underground nation of the kandra on scadrial during the final empire. it was located in the same mountain range as the arguois caverns and the pits of hathsin, in fact many of its tunnels connected to the latter and had to be kept blocked and guarded. it was located close to luthadel. after harmony remade the world an entrance to the homeland was placed directly under the field of rebirth. the caverns of the homeland were said to be quite large, too large to be filled by the kandra, some members liked the solitude they provided after decades out on contracts. the trustwarren[edit] ""“he soon realized that their destination must be the trustwarren. he would argue his defense in his people's most sacred place ”-tensoon, a member of the third generation"" the trustwarren was one of the most important caverns in the entire cave complex, evidenced by the fact that it was one of the only rooms lit by oil lamps. it was circular and had metal walls. in the center there was a platform about a foot tall made of steel, with a small hole in the center. it served a number of functions such as a meeting room for the entire kandra people, a courtroom, and as the location of the trust. the trust was the name given by the kandra to the lord ruler's atium cache, which was part of ruin's power. the vast majority of the atium mined in the pits never left the complex but was instead smuggled into the homeland, to be hidden under the platform in the center of the trustwarren. this was done to deny ruin access to a part of his power. the atium used to pay for service contracts was also added to the trust. other locations of note[edit] not much is known about the different areas of the homeland apart from the trustwarren. however, the following locations were either mentioned or seen. - a cavern where food for the kandra, a kind of fungus was grown in stone pits. - a prison where renegade kandra are kept. notes[edit]"
Blome,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Blome,"blome is a bronze misting (aka a seeker) and a bartender for lord winsting innate at his mansion in elendel on scadrial. history[edit] blome worked for house innate for an unknown length of time, but he did more for innate than simply tending bar. blome was a seeker, which allowed him to tell which of winsting's guests were allomancers. he was present at an auction for winsting's vote that took place in the year 342. he indicated to winsting that no one there was burning any metals. when paalm assassinated winsting, blome was presumably among those killed in the fighting. notes[edit]"
Zinc,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Rioter,"zinc is the external mental pulling metal. an allomancer burning zinc is able to inflame the emotions of those around them. it can be targeted at a single person or a group. a feruchemist can use zinc to store mental speed. when used as a hemalurgic spike, zinc steals emotional fortitude. the paired alloy of zinc used in the metallic arts is brass. allomantic use[edit] a zinc misting is known as a rioter. emotional allomancy is not mind control, but it does allow the practitioner to influence the emotions of those around them. this is known as rioting or raging. the effects can be targeted at a specific individual or group and can focus on specific emotions. it is easier to target a specific direction instead of at a specific individual. rioting emotions can be used to increase someone's desire, determination, or anger. it can accomplish many of the same things as soothing emotions by rioting all but the specified emotions. extreme emotions in the target will interfere with emotional allomancy. emotional allomancy can affect animals, however it requires a certain amount of sapience. emotional allomancy also has a more compelling effect on lifeless compared to a regular person. a rioter cannot riot themselves. very powerful rioting can put a hemalurgic creature under complete control of the rioter, and once controlled, the rioting is no longer required. this can either be achieved by a solitary mistborn or hemalurgist burning duralumin and zinc together, a combination of a nicroburst and a rioter, or a group of rioters and/or soothers, though in the early days of final empire, when allomancy was much more powerful, a single rioter was able to do it. rioting inside of a speed bubble could give the same effects as burning duralumin, and can still be aimed without the normal hindrances of exiting time bubbles. aluminum over the victim's head or possibly the rioter's chest stops rioting. it can also be stopped by the helmet of a shardplate. after the catacendre, it is unlawful for a business to use rioters to influence customers. this was one of the provisions of the allomantic agreement of '94. however, consensual use of emotional allomancy is not forbidden, and some rioters, known as zinc counselors uses their abilities as a kind of therapy. feruchemical use[edit] a zinc ferring is known as a sparker. zinc is used to store mental speed. it allows the sparker to think very quickly and come to conclusions faster. while filling a zincmind, the sparker will be dull-witted and slow. storing does not affect the sparker's ability to take in physical information, but it does increase the time it takes to process that information. for example, a sparker filling their zincmind will perceive words without delay, but will take longer to parse their meaning. tapping zinc has the odd side effect of making the user hungry. hemalurgic use[edit] when used as a hemalurgic spike, zinc steals emotional fortitude. kandra blessing[edit] the kandra can use a pair of these spikes as a blessing and call them the blessing of stability. like all kandra blessings, the blessing gives the mistwraiths sentience, with the added benefit of emotional stability. fabrial use[edit] a fabrial with a zinc cage will increase the strength of the fabrial's function. culture[edit] zinctongue is a colloquialism for smooth talkers. trivia[edit] in the ars arcanum of the final empire, the allomantic roles of brass and zinc were swapped. this was fixed in the well of ascension, then repeated in the hero of ages. notes[edit]"

Stefan Sauvage,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Stefan_Sauvage,"stefan sauvage is a scadrian nobleman and the father of nicelle sauvage. history[edit] in 336 pc, lord sauvage commissioned a large tapestry map of new seran. he included a secret pocket in the map that contained a letter to his daughter nicelle (also known as nicki savage). the letter supposedly included information that stefan had learned about lost metal beings created by the lord ruler that he called kalkis. by 342 pc, he had presumably died, as nicelle referred to the map as her inheritance. nazh stole the map from nicelle, but after a brief struggle that tore the map in two, she was able to get back the piece that had the hidden pocket. nazh escaped with the ""better"" part of the map. nicelle was known to embellish her stories, but nazh did in fact annotate a ripped map of new seran. the details of stefan's letter remain unknown, and it is not clear if nazh was aware of it. notes[edit]"
Kelesina Shores's steward,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Kelesina_Shores%27s_steward,"a terriswoman works for kelesina shores as an assistant house steward at the shores mansion in new seran on scadrial. appearance and personality[edit] she is aged and wears the traditional terris tinningdar. she is presumably somewhat frail and slender when filling a feruchemical pewtermind; when she taps one, her neck becomes as large as a man's thigh. attributes and abilities[edit] the steward is a ferring known as a brute and is able to store and later tap physical strength in a pewtermind. her body transforms when she taps pewter, instantly increasing her musculature to the point that wax describes her as ""enormous"". despite her size in this state, she still moves very quickly. she is able to choke wax nearly to the point of unconsciousness, and she punches melaan hard enough to split her flesh and reveal her bones. she is also resistant to pain and continues to attack even after her nose is broken and her hand is shattered. the steward is trusted by kelesina and is tasked with both reporting on wax's activities and passing on information from kelesina's staff, including her seeker. the steward has significant knowledge of kelesina's interactions with the set; suit addresses the steward directly when she walks in on a conversation that he was having with kelesina through a communication device. it is not clear if the steward is a member of the set, but her actions imply that she was working directly with suit or other members of the set without kelesina's knowledge. when wax appears, the steward shoots kelesina almost immediately; wax believes this was a pre-planned move by suit to get rid of kelesina and frame him for the murder. the steward is also aware that kelesina possesses a powerful goldmind in the shape of a bracelet, and makes sure to take it from her corpse. history[edit] kelesina's steward attended to waxillium ladrian and steris harms after they left kelesina shores's party due to steris's self-induced illness. she asked after steris and was relieved to learn that the food at the party was not the cause of her vomiting. when bastien severington began his speech, the steward returned to the ballroom to listen.

Edwarn Ladrian,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Mister_Suit,"edwarn ladrian also known as mister suit, is the uncle of waxillium ladrian, a member of high society in elendel and a high ranked member of the set. appearance and personality[edit] edwarn ladrian is a round-faced, stocky man distinguished by a short, precisely trimmed beard, a beautifully tailored suit, and a cravat so narrow and thin, it lay flat like a bowtie loosened at the end of a long night. he is usually wearing an extremely stylish and expensive suit of black silk with a turquoise vest. he also uses a whale-ivory cane. he doesn’t like the smell of cigars. edwarn was very invested on the fortune of his house and had kept very good track of what his competitor houses had been shipping, still he ended up spending it to fund the set. he is a follower of trellism, a claim is made that he will deliver information to wax in relation to these beliefs, after which ironeyes delivers a book for wax. when the red eyed faceless immortal comes to him he makes a claim stating that he will follow trell. attributes and abilities[edit] he is a hemalurgist with three spikes, granting him the power of a coinshot, a bloodmaker, and a leecher respectively, due to the fact that having four or more hemalurgic spikes would make one susceptible to harmony's complete control. history[edit] edwarn was wax's uncle, a descendant of breeze and allrianne, and was the fifteenth high lord of house ladrian. before edwarn faked his death, it was widely believed that he had wasted the family fortune through poor business deals while earning a meager sum betting on horse races. he was remembered as hermit-like save for his letters to the broadsheets about political matters, and had offended three-quarters of the city’s upper crust. it was later revealed he had prepared hinston to take over the ladrians’ house, but owing to an unfortunate disease that resulted in his death, edwarn had to resort to wax instead. he also confirmed that he was secretly transferring funds into the set's bank account in preparation for his fake death and subsequent new life. overtime edwarn proposed and was given approval to begin his own operation under the set known as the community. the original goal of the project had been to provide allomancer to the set for their experiments in the long term. in order to facilitate this plan he formed the vanishers. he managed to doom house tekiel. by funding the vanishers in their robberies, the house owed payments on too many high-profile losses. these attacks, and the insurance claims, devastated them and their financial integrity. company shareholders had been selling their stakes for pennies. edwarn and the set wanted to breed allomancers. he hired miles and the vanishers to capture women with correct powers to do so. both steris and marasi were on his list, and when the former was captured, wax took it upon himself to find her. wax figured out he was alive and under the alias of “mr suit”, miles' employer. he also decoded miles' notes which tracked his moves. he found his uncle, but had to let him go, as he had his sister captive. edwarn was later confirmed to be looking to start a rebellion in elendel, creating chaos and profiting from it. along with the set he was developing higher technology that was still kept secret from the rest of the population; they were probably using it to create allomancers, as there was not time for breeding. edwarn was also looking for a weapon in the south, so he trekked to the temple housing them. he tried to negotiate with wax to help get them and almost managed to kill him by using his sister telsin as a mole who shot him. as wax got the bands' power and recovered, he confronted his uncle who was quick to arm a bomb in an airship and managed a duel. eventually wax beat edwarn, leaving him tied to the top of the temple’s lord ruler’s spear. later, a faceless immortal with glowing red eyes visited him in prison and was impressed that he didn't give away any information. it then killed edwarn and itself with an explosion just after stating: “you will be allowed to serve in another realm.” relationships[edit] waxillium ladrian[edit] as wax's uncle, edwarn understands his nephew very much to the point of nearly predicting his every movements. he had overseen wax´s education, grooming him specifically as heir to the house. because hinston dies, he searches for wax to take over his fortune and estate after his death, hoping he has overcome his sense of morality. this is not the case, and though he resisted killing him in the beginning he later asked his butler tillaume kill wax. he survives and understood that for someone who had been loyal to the family for so long, the only reason he could be so eager to kill him was that he was following his former master. this is how wax finds out his uncle is still alive. telsin ladrian[edit] edwarn is telsin's uncle, and they both faked their death in the same carriage accident. she is a member of the set and had him join. she outranks him, and can give him orders. quotes[edit] ""“money is meaningless;

Chromium,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Leecher,"chromium is the external enhancement pulling metal. an allomancer burning chromium is able to make the metal reserves of another allomancer vanish. feruchemists can use chromium to store fortune, and when used as a hemalurgic spike, chromium might steal destiny. the paired alloy of chromium used in the metallic arts is nicrosil. allomantic use[edit] a chromium misting is known as a leecher. chromium acts just like aluminum inside the body, causing any allomancers touched by a leecher to lose their metal reserves. when burning away a person's metals, it feels like pulling power from the metal and returning it to an external source. being leeched makes one feel a sudden coldness. this power is similar to nightblood and larkin. when burning away a person's metals, non-invested metals go before the invested ones. only allomantically relevant metals can be burned away. draining investiture[edit] a leecher can also drain other forms of investiture. they would be fairly effective at draining a person's breath or stormlight. they could also leech a feruchemist who was tapping their metalmind. they would be able to leech from a lifeless. a leecher could prevent a shardbearer from summoning their blade, and can prevent a weapon using investiture from working. if a leecher touched nightblood, the leecher would die. feruchemical use[edit] a chromium ferring is known as a spinner. chromium is used to store fortune. a spinner filling a chromiummind will be unlucky, and can tap it to increase their luck. compounding[edit] a chromium compounder might be able to use chromium to have a nearly infinite supply of fortune and luck; however, the mechanics of fortune are unknown at this time. hemalurgic use[edit] when used as a hemalurgic spike, chromium might steal destiny. other uses[edit] alonoe of the ire mentions that drawing on fortune can cause coincidences to happen. odium implies it may be used to predict the future. notes[edit]"

Dominance,https://coppermind.net/wiki/Terris_Dominance,"the dominances were the ten regions of governance in the final empire on scadrial. the current structure of dominances, in vin's time, involves provincial lords each with command of, and responsibility for, their own skaa. this organization has been in place for two hundred years and grants the nobility greater freedom than previous systems. the lord ruler seems to be uncomfortable with this and counteracts it with increased obligator activity . after the fall of the lord ruler, some of the dominances became independent kingdoms. inner dominances[edit] each of these dominances contains one of the lord ruler's storage caverns. there has not been a significant rebellion in the five inner dominances in two centuries, before yeden hired kelsier. before ruin's release, earthquakes were very rare in the inner dominances . central dominance[edit] politics[edit] this dominance can be found in the center of the final empire, and holds the city of luthadel, capital of the final empire. it was the most politically significant dominance in all the final empire. although it was the smallest dominance in terms of land area, it was more populous then any other as well. the great houses all maintained noble keeps here to keep their fingers on the pulse of the empire; indeed, a keep in luthadel qualifies a house as a great house . noble balls and other sources of intrigue kept the nobles entertained. this was the economic center of the final empire and fortunes were regularly won and lost through business dealings and backstabbing. the lord ruler's influence was pervasive here. the obligators and inquisitors of the steel ministry were never far away. they kept the nobles in line, witnessing contracts, both large and small. luthadel, inside the central dominance, had a large underworld element which survives through theft and trickery, composed of both regular crews and illegal allomancers. large and violent mass executions served to remind both skaa and nobles alike that the lord ruler reigned supreme. after the lord ruler's death, elend venture became king. during the siege of luthadel elend was voted out of office and replaced with ferson penrod. after the siege ended with the attacking generals' surrender to vin, penrod remained king of the central dominance under elend's overarching new empire. geography[edit] the central dominance has normally mild winter, with no snow at all in some years . it was good for grazing land as well. the land under luthadel was rich with metal, most notably tin and brass. another interesting trait of the central dominance was the massive complexes of caves located within its borders; the dominance contains hundreds of cave systems . the river channerel ran through luthadel and the central dominance on its way to the southern sea. the central dominance contained two major bodies of water, lake luthadel to the north and lake tyrian to the west, so named for the ashmount tyrian that it was adjacent to. the dominant plant life in the central dominance is hardy scrub well adapted to ash . resources & economics[edit] the most important resource that the central dominance produced was atium, from the pits of hathsin. atium made up the most important currency in the final empire, useful for paying for kandra contracts, as well as payment for many noble deals. the central dominance also was known for its metalworking, refining ore into usable metals. there are hundreds of forges and refineries in luthadel . since it contained luthadel, the central dominance's most important economic function was to serve as a place where business was done, contracts signed, and bargains struck. this also allowed the lord ruler to have a tight grip on the economy of the final empire. since luthadel was his home he could keep an eye on the scheming nobility. notable locations[edit] places of interest included the caves known as the pits of hathsin, as well as ruin's perpendicularity located within. the nearby kandra homeland was also located in caves and the other major cave complex, the arguois caverns, were home to the skaa rebellion. the lord ruler's palace, kredik shaw was located in the central dominance. in tunnels beneath it were both the first storage cache and the well of ascension, preservation's perpendicularity. other settlements include valtroux, holstep, suisna, and fellise. northern dominance[edit] politics[edit] this dominance was home to the ventures, the most powerful great house in the time of the skaa rebellion. being one of the inner dominances, it was subject to high scrutiny by the obligators and the lord ruler, alert for any signs of rebellion among the skaa. after the collapse, straff venture takes control of the dominance. under elend's new empire, janarle is king of the northern dominance. geography[edit] the northern dominance is a varied land containing hills, valleys, forests, and mountains (on the border of the eastern dominance). the hills and mountains form the source of a plethora of natural waterways that flow through the dominance. one of these waterways is the river channerel which runs along the northern dominance's southern border. the northern dominance contains only one ashmount, kalling, which is located to the north of urteau. resources & economics[edit] the streams and rivers of the northern dominance support both forests and farms. the northern dominance has coal mines in the area of urteau. urteau also had canals for streets which allowed for the easy transportation of goods. however when the canals were drained, urteau became backwater and its trade influence diminished. notable locations[edit] the regional capital of urteau was a major economic center for the dominance. this city was important enough to hold one of the lord ruler's storage caches under the building of the canton of resource. eastern dominance[edit] known communities included statlin city (the site of a storage cavern), urbene, and erlac. other places of interest included the conventical of seran. many people in the southern dominances have darker skin than most peoples on the inner dominances, though not as dark as some terris peoples can get. the eastern dominance is likely included in the southern dominances. geography[edit] this dominance contains the ashmount faleast. major bodies of water include the black lake (which extends slightly into the central dominance) and the river seran as well as its associated lakes north seran and south seran. (a small part of south seran appears to extend into the crescent dominance.) resources[edit] gold is mined in the eastern dominance, in the area where spook was born. western dominance[edit] capital: tremredare, and later fadrex city. it also contained chardees, chakath, and mantiz. politics[edit] fadrex city became the capital of the dominance after the collapse since it was more defensible than tremredare, originally under king ashweather cett. aradan yomen, previously the leading obligator of the area, eventually became king of the western dominance, still ruling from fadrex city . geography[edit] the ashmounts morag and torinost are located here. the landscape contains eroded plateaus, spires of rock, and canyons. the rock formations form natural fortifications for fadrex city. the dominance's plateaus represent some of the highest elevation farmland in the final empire . other features[edit] fadrex city is the site of a storage cavern. in the northern part, the buildings have a fluid, organic shape quite different from luthadel. numerous canal routes run in the area of fadrex city, including the conway canal. southern dominance[edit] the capital under the lord ruler was austrex, though in the time of the new empire lekal city was the seat of king audil lekal. other settlements include vetitan (the site of a storage cavern), garthwood, and longsfollow. the ashmounts zerinah and doriel are in this dominance. it has a coast on the southern sea. many people in the southern dominance have darker skin than most peoples on the inner dominances, though not as dark as some terris peoples can get. outer dominances[edit] at the edge of the empire, these dominances (at least those away from the sea) border on - and perhaps include part of - the burnlands deserts inhabited by koloss, who can survive the conditions. humans escaping from the final empire live in the border area. after ruin was freed, there outer dominances became unable to support crops and were overrun by koloss. terris dominance[edit] capital: tathingdwen places of interest included mount derytatith, the location of the well of ascension prior to the ascension of the lord ruler. however, while it retained the name and was the home of the terris people, the terris dominance was not truly the same place as terris during classical scadrial. rashek created the mountains of the terris dominance during his ascension, and removed the mountains from ancient terris, during his ascension to hide the location of the well. there are a lot of small villages across the terris dominance. farmost dominance[edit] located to the west and north-west of the western dominance, the farmost dominance is largely unknown. it contains a significant area of sea. before being replaced by the kandra oreseur, lord renoux held great power in this dominance, though vin's cover story suggests house renoux lives in chakath in the western dominance. crescent dominance[edit] the crescent dominance is the farthest eastern dominance in the final empire. no character in the series is from this place, nor have any of the characters traveled there. as such, very little is known about it. the dominance contains a small part of the lake south seran (which is mostly in the eastern dominance). otherwise, the land appears to be mostly sand dunes. this dominance either borders on or is part of the burnlands at the edge of the empire inhabited by bandit and nomad tribes made of fugitive skaa rebelling against the final empire (the ""wasted men""), who survive by raiding the eastern dominance. therefore, conflicts in this southeastern area of the empire are common. koloss hordes are sometimes dispatched against the wasted men; even a steel inquisitor may be sent against successful leaders such as vershad. southern islands[edit] this dominance is separated from the mainland by the southern sea. it contains at least two major islands. remote dominance[edit] the remote dominance was located to the southwest of the eastern dominance, below the southern islands. it is largely isolated, cut off by mountains on the border with the eastern dominance and sea separating it from the southern islands. this dominance likely borders on, or includes, the burnlands at the edge of the empire where the ""wasted men"" (tribes rebelling against the final empire) live. notes[edit]"

Trell (Trellism),https://coppermind.net/wiki/Trellism,"""“she looked down at the small spike in her hands, and heard a name from a year ago, spoken by miles hundredlives as he died. the name of a god from the old days... who, or what, was trell? ”-marasi begins researching trell in earnest"" trell is an avatar of autonomy worshiped by followers of trelagism, and later trellism on scadrial. trell became a force of opposition against harmony sometime after the catacendre. nature[edit] trell is the avatar of autonomy. harmony appears to use a vast, red haze around scadrial to represent the intrusion of another shard when meeting with waxillium ladrian, and wax described a sensation of ""dread and destruction"" choking him upon observing it. the appearance of red suggests that the entity is co-opting or corrupting the investiture of another shard. history[edit] [expand] the name trell has been used in many ways over the eons. trell is not native to yolen. the seeds for trell's personality began to be placed during the classical scadrial time period when autonomy prepped the planet for a potential later incursion. following the catacendre and the actions of kelsier a group of individuals in the scadrian system grew more interested in possessing powers that stem from off-world. these individuals began to research about the powers granted by 'ancient deities,' these groups eventually attracted the attention of autonomy who then began using their trell personna again. the group would later go on to become the set. following this the religion of the set began to morph into a newer form of tregalism, renamed trellism. beyond trellism, the first overt evidence of trell's involvement came in the form of a mysterious spike used by paalm to hide from harmony's sight. according to harmony, trell had surrounded the planet of scadrial and was laying siege to harmony's defenses sometime around 340 pc. associated magic[edit] a silvery metal with distinctive, dark red spots is associated with trell. this metal has been utilized as a hemalurgic spike in several ways. first and foremost is the strange way that such a spike blinds harmony to the recipient of the spike. additionally, the spike may also be used to steal mysterious attributes previously unknown to the kandra. melaan theorized that paalm was able to utilize stolen allomancy and feruchemy by means of these attributes. lastly, the use of such a spike in rian appeared to cause, if nothing else, a level of psychological distress. it is possible that miles was spiked with this metal as well, before he died. there are red-eyed faceless immortals which appear to act as agents on behalf of trell. it is unclear who or what these beings are and how similar they are to typical kandra. religion[edit] ""“you are fools! one day, the men of gold and red, bearers of the final metal, will come to you. and you will be ruled by them. worship. worship trell and wait ... ”-miles dagouter's last words"" beliefs[edit] followers of trellism appear to trace the religion's roots to trelagism as it is described in the words of founding. the extent to which these religions are related is unclear, as the two religions share no apparent similarities beyond the name of their god. adherents of trellism believe in a deity named trell, whom they consider to be their creator in some capacity. at least some among them appear to believe in an apocalyptic prophecy which claims that ""men of gold and red, bearers of the final metal"" will arrive and rule over the people of elendel, and perhaps all of scadrial. miles dagouter encouraged people to actively worship trell, though the details on how trell is worshiped are unknown. miles believed that trell created him ""to see wrongs righted"" and that the religion's teachings proved he was ""special"" in some way. it is unclear to what extent miles' beliefs concerning social justice are held in common among other members of the religion. it is likely that some kernel of these ideas is pervasive in trellism, given some relations to the philosophies of paalm and edwarn ladrian. followers[edit] despite the religion's mention in the words of founding, it is relatively unknown among the general population of northern scadrial. marasi colms had a difficult time researching the religion, with few people willing to speak openly about their knowledge. several members of the set, in both high and low positions, are followers of trellism, and the organization itself may exist for the purpose of serving trell. presumed followers of trellism have been seen both swearing by and giving thanks to trell. red-eyed ""faceless immortals"" appear to work on behalf of trell, and have been known to visit followers of trell on occasion. paalm also appears to be an agent of trell, though neither paalm or the red-eyed faceless immortals show any signs of being adherents of trellism. trivia[edit] brandon's plans for trell in future books were outlined during the writing of the first mistborn trilogy. as the mistborn era 2 books were not planned at the time, it comes as no surprise that trell will have a much more prominent role in the mistborn era 3 trilogy. notes[edit]"

the curse can only be broken if charlie brings tress to the sorceress to be cursed. as huck[edit] charlie tries to go back to diggen's point as a rat, stowing away on the oot's dream. he's caught eating their rations, and is captured and put in a cage in the ship's hold. tress happens to be put there as well, and when the crow's song attacks the oot's dream, sinking it, she rescues charlie from his cage. since, due to his curse, he can't tell her that his name is charlie, he tries to say ""chuck,"" but it comes out as ""huck."" the seethe stops, and tress carries charlie on her shoulder and they walk together to the crow's song, climbing on board. on the crow's song, charlie mostly sits on tress's shoulder, making observations and helping her figure out the crew's secrets. after tress discovers the forecannon's hidden compartment, charlie catches laggart sneaking cannonballs into his pack. tress asks him to spy on laggart's private conversation with crow, which he does, and insists on reenacting it with tress. laggart and crow notice charlie spying on them, and when the crow's song stops at shimmerbay, they get a cat to fend him off, which he becomes terrified of. he tries to pressure tress to leave the ship and abandon the crew, but she disagrees, and he reluctantly stays on the ship with her. hoid tries to tell tress and ulaam that ""huck"" is important, but tress comes to the wrong conclusion after ulaam tells her about familiars, figuring that ""huck"" is a normal rat that was invested by the sorceress. charlie denies this, but after more questioning from tress, he's able to exploit a loophole in his curse to explain to her how the sorceress's curses work. when tress uses the luhel bond to transfer her consciousness to midnight essence, she quickly becomes dehydrated and charlie saves her life by pulling her waterskin towards her with his teeth. sailing the crimson[edit] to deter tress from continuing towards the sorceress's island, charlie tells her about the trials she'll have to face when she gets there, saying that he knows about them from the ""rat population"" of a port the crow's song stopped at, but it doesn't work and the crow's song continues onwards. after tress becomes the captain of the crow's song, she introduces charlie to fort, ann, and salay. all of them adore him; ann offers to make a cage for the cat, and salay has a tiny pirate's hat made for him. charlie also tells them that he knows a way into the sorceress's tower. unfortunately, their opinion of him is almost immediately soured, since he has hoid throw some of the ship's food stores overboard in a desperate attempt to get tress to stop pursuing the sorceress. this doesn't work either, since the crew can just eat verdant vines; tress decides she can't trust ""huck"" anymore, locking him in a cage. charlie begs tress to take him with her when she goes to meet the sorceress. she reluctantly agrees, and the two take a small rowboat into the midnight sea. sailing the midnight[edit] charlie tells the midnight essence that it has free passage into the midnight (because of his curse). the creatures capture tress and take her and charlie to the sorceress's island, which makes tress believe that charlie is a familiar of the sorceress. tress and charlie climb the tower; they meet riina at the top, who trades an illusory version of charlie to tress for two cups. the real charlie is disappointed that tress couldn't figure out who he was and leaves, but after tress talks to the illusion, she knows it's not him and quickly deduces that ""huck"" must actually be charlie. charlie starts crying, bemoaning the fact that he couldn't protect her from riina. the crow's song shows up at the tower, and charlie runs to open the door so that they can bring hoid inside the tower. riina's cat corners him, so he runs inside tress's pewter cup, letting the cat toss him down the stairs and to the door. charlie gets it to open, and hoid enters just in time to save tress from being cursed by riina, who leaves lumar. breaking the curse[edit] hoid changes the parameters of charlie's curse so that instead of bringing tress to the sorceress's home to be cursed, he had to bring tress to her home to be versed (to have a poem written for her). he fulfills this easily, turning back into a human. when tress sells the crow's song and transfers its crew to a new ship, the two cups, he joins the crew as a valet, storyteller, and musician. notes[edit]"
First Gem,https://coppermind.net/wiki/First_Gem,"the first gem is a topaz with magical properties that hoid once carried and from which he took his name for a while. the name first gem was referenced by patji in the second oathbringer letter, when he addressed hoid as ""cephandrius, bearer of the first gem."" the fact that hoid was a dawnshard at some point is related to his title as bearer of the first gem. theories[edit] a character named ""topaz"" appears in the unpublished work dragonsteel prime. although dragonsteel prime is not canonical, brandon has confirmed that some individuals in the cosmere still know hoid by that name. hoid told kaladin that he was once named for a beautiful rock that became ""completely worthless"" for his wearing it. if this is a reference to the first gem, it likely indicates that it no longer holds its original magical properties. frost also mentions a gemstone being ""dead"" in his letter to hoid. although topaz is a polestone on roshar, frost and patji's knowledge of the gem, its name, and hoid's status as one of the oldest beings in the cosmere all hint that the first gem has importance beyond roshar. notes[edit]"
